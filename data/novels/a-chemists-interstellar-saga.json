      "content": "Chapter 1: Rebirth\nArix never felt this happy in her life before. The moment she passed her Ph.D. defense, she didn’t even care about all the professors watching. She just flopped down into a chair nearby, out of breath, and cursed, \"Damn.\"\nWhen she stepped out of the research institute, it felt like the sunlight in the whole world got a bit brighter. Even though it was still early, she decided to hit up a bar for a drink.\n\"Cheers to graduation, Dr. Arix Vetti. Starting today, you’re a Chemist,\" Arix mumbled to herself as she walked.\nShe didn’t realize at that moment that, her happiness today was not only unprecedented but also would never come back.\nAs she turned into the alley leading to the bar—\n\"Bang!\"\nA gunshot came from behind Arix. She felt a chill in her heart and before she could do anything, a sensation like an electric shock spread from her chest throughout her body. Then everything went dark, and she lost consciousness.\nWhen she woke up again, she was greeted by an old, yellowed ceiling. Confused, she tried to sit up in bed, but her back ached from the hard mattress beneath her.\nArix believed in God. During her most helpless times in her Ph.D. studies, it was God who gave her the strength to carry on. She also believed in the afterlife and souls. Her favorite movie was \"Coco.\"\nBut she was also a very practical person. She never believed that magical things could happen to her, like what was happening right now...\nShe lay in a strange room, and in the mirror across from her, she saw a girl she didn’t recognize at all.\nAt that moment, a loud engine roar came from outside the window. Instinctively, Arix peered out and saw a giant mecha—yes, the kind she had only seen in comics as a kid.\nThe mecha was far away from the window but so huge that Arix could see every part of it clearly. They were large and intricate, reflecting a cold and dazzling shine under the sunlight.\nThe mecha hovered in mid-air for a moment before shooting off like a meteor in one direction, chasing after a strangely shaped thing that was fleeing.\nArix thought she was hallucinating. She shook her head vigorously, recalling how she had just fainted not long ago. And before fainting... Graduation, bar street, gunshot... Yes! She heard a gunshot!\nArix’s eyes suddenly widened, and she frantically touched her chest where she remembered being shot. She was sure she must have died then.\n\"Am I resurrected? Where is this? In a comic?\" Arix kept talking to herself. Fear and unease piled up inside her.\nJust then, the door to the room creaked open, and a little boy walked in. Spotting her awake, he paused in surprise before dashing out quickly.\nIn no time, the previously empty small room was packed with people.\nA nun, probably in her seventies, slowly made her way to Arix’s bedside and sat down. Behind her stood seven scruffily dressed kids, all with excited sparkles in their eyes, seeming really happy.\nOne of the kids tugged at Arix’s sleeve and whispered, \"Arix, you finally woke up. Sister Gwen and all of us were so worried about you.\"\nSeeing the group, clearly harmless elderly and children, Arix felt a bit relieved since it seemed she was safe for now.\nUnfamiliar with her current situation, Arix mostly just smiled in response to the warmth and questions from the elderly nun and the kids. She was careful to answer only those questions that wouldn’t reveal she was no longer the girl they knew.\n\"I was woken up by some noise outside just now. What happened out there?\" Arix asked carefully.\nA kid honestly replied, \"You mean just before? Airee and I were building our castle outside when suddenly an Insectoid flew over us. We quickly hid inside the orphanage. Then it seemed like the insectoid was chased away by an unfamiliar mecha.\"\nArix was shocked inside but managed to keep a smile, though it looked a bit forced.\nSister Gwen, seeing Arix’s gentle but strained smile, felt even more pity and became more determined about something.\nSo, Sister Gwen told the kids, who were still happily circling around Arix, \"Go outside for a bit, I need to talk to her alone.\"\n\"Okay, Sister Gwen.\" The kids, respecting Sister Gwen a lot, glanced at Arix with care before obediently leaving the room.\nArix didn’t understand what Sister Gwen intended to do but felt the nun meant no harm. She now knew she wasn’t on Earth anymore; Dr. Arix Vetti had barely enjoyed an hour of academic glory before dying in a gang shootout.\nShe realized she had been reborn, in the body of a girl she didn’t know, who also was also named Arix.\nArix smiled bitterly, grateful that at least she had gained another life. The orphanage had a nun, so it was probably a house of God, and she felt she should still be thankful to God.\nSister Gwen didn’t know what Arix was thinking, but she could feel that Arix had become gentler; the girl was not like before when she seemed like a hedgehog in defense mode, all spikes, not letting anyone get close.\n\"I’m so sorry for what happened. It’s been tough for me too, but let’s forget about the admission letter from Koros Military Academy. The Koros is gone, but we still have the Hecaris Military Academy. I reached out to an old friend overnight, and here’s a recommendation letter for the Hecaris. He’s a highly honored veteran, so his recommendation carries a lot of weight. As long as you pass the entrance exam of the Hecaris, you can enroll. After you graduate, you’ll still be an outstanding student of the Alliance military.\"\nAfter saying all this in one breath, Sister Gwen seemed relieved. She took a yellow envelope from her bosom and handed it to Arix.\nArix was somewhat confused. She took the envelope without fully understanding what the two academies were.\nJust then, a wave of desperate cries and unfamiliar images flooded into her mind like a tide. Arix knew these were the memories of the body’s original owner, the Old Arix, merging with her own.\nAfter Sister Gwen saw Arix take the letter, she smiled. She reminded her to rest well, and left the room alone.\nAfter Arix went through the girl’s memories, she held the envelope and couldn’t help but clench her fist, her eyes filled with anger.\nThe initial images from those memories seemed to be of a landfill.\nAmidst swarms of flies, the Old Arix was struggling through stinking piles of garbage. Many filthy vagrants were around her, moving sluggishly, sifting through different mounds of trash.\nThe Old Arix was young then and didn’t understand why she was there; she didn’t even know what she was doing at first. But soon, her stomach began to ache with hunger, so she learned from the people around her to scavenge for food in the garbage hills.\nAfter a long search, the Old Arix finally found a dirty, wrinkled apple that almost looked like a piece of tree bark. Just as she was about to take a bite, a filthy person snatched it away from her.\nHaving her hard-found food taken away, Arix naturally didn’t want to give up. She tried to snatch it back but was thrown harshly to the ground and knocked unconscious.\nAt that time, Sister Gwen arrived at the landfill. She had set up a temporary soup kitchen there to offer porridge to the homeless. Seeing the weak Arix, she took pity and brought her back to the orphanage.\nThe Old Arix, however, was a loner and very wary of others. She had run away from the orphanage several times.\nEventually, Sister Gwen had no choice but to build a small room next to the orphanage for her. Only then did the Old Arix somewhat lower her guard and move in. So, the Old Arix survived in that small room beside the orphanage.\nAfter turning six, she joined the other children from Planet Waste in attending the Alliance’s compulsory schooling and, she was even fortunate enough to test out as having Moon-Class potential mentally and physically.\nWhile Moon Class might not be considered outstanding in the Alliance, it was quite a promising potential on the remote Planet Waste.\nWith her own hard work, the Old Arix excelled academically, securing the top position year after year and eventually earning admission to the Koros Military Academy on Planet Koros.\nBut just when things seemed to be looking up, the daughter of the ruler of Planet Waste appeared, taking away the admission letter to the Koros Military Academy that the Old Arix had worked ten years for, much like a step-sister stealing Cinderella’s glass slipper.\nPrincess Waste even found Arix’s small room, looked at Arix with disdain as if she were garbage, then tossed a card worth a million astracredits at her. Before leaving, she threatened to kill everyone in the orphanage if Arix revealed anything.\nFor the sake of Sister Gwen and the seven kids, the Old Arix had no choice but to accept the card. She knew that accepting this million would mean that, if the substitution was ever discovered, the person who took her place could claim she had traded for the spot.\nIn the end, the Old Arix compromised for the sake of the orphanage, but the imposter wasn’t reassured and hired someone to sneak into the small room at night and poison the Old Arix. And so, the young Arix silently lost her life in despair.",

      "content": "Chapter 2: Life Stolen\nAfter viewing all of the Old Arix’s memories, Arix placed her hand over her chest, her eyes coldly determined. \"I will make them pay for what they’ve done!\"\nTaking a deep breath, she set the envelope aside on the bed. Right now, she wasn’t in a position to confront a planet ruler.\nHer immediate priority was to completely clear the lingering black fog from the poison that remained in her mind. If left unchecked, Arix herself might soon meet the same fate as the Old Arix.\nClosing her eyes, Arix began to meditate. Her consciousness smoothly entered her psychic world. The moment her awareness entered, the psychic world, like an overinflated balloon, suddenly burst.\nArix felt a clear change. Her psychic world had transformed from a narrow, rushing river into a vast and calm sea, endless and serene.\nArix didn’t realize how unbelievably expansive her psychic world had become. She only faintly sensed that her psychic power seemed to have upgraded, and the level was not low.\nEven in the memories of the Old Arix, she had never had such an immense psychic world.\nOriginally, the Old Arix’s psychic power was shocking enough to astound the entire Alliance. However, due to her own lack of awareness in this area, her prodigious abilities remained unrecognized.\nArix was unaware of how astonishing her talent had now become. At this moment, looking at the black fog generated by the poison in her psychic world, she felt an instinctive, intense aversion.\nThe psychic power in her psychic world, as if sensing her emotions, attacked the black fog in a frenzy.\nThe erosive nature of the black fog was strong, turning countless psychic powers dark.\nMore psychic powers surged forward, relentlessly expelling the black fog.\nAfter a full hour, Arix finally expelled the last trace of black fog from her body. Watching the fog dissipate in the air, she finally relaxed. She then had the chance to examine the psychic powers in her psychic world more closely.\nWith the black fog gone, her mental realm became incredibly calm. The occasional ripples that stirred up would flash a faint, icy blue glint, looking from afar like glowing stars, profoundly stunning.\nAfter some investigation, Arix concluded that she seemed to have acquired some kind of superpower.\nShe didn’t fully understand the function of these psychic powers yet. However, just the glimpse of psychic power she had witnessed was enough to thrill her to the core.\nAfter exiting her psychic world, it took Arix a while to calm down. She looked out the window again and noticed that the mechas and insectoid monsters from earlier had vanished without a trace.\nArix took a deep breath of relief. She picked up the recommendation letter for the Hecaris Military Academy from the bed.\nAfter experiencing the changes in her psychic world, Arix was filled with curiosity and excitement about this unfamiliar interstellar era. This recommendation letter would be her key to unlocking the door to this new world.\nEarly the next morning, Arix left 900,000 astracredits from the 1 million ransom money for Sister Gwen. To avoid causing trouble by staying too long, she decided to leave early.\nGwen refused to accept the money. \"You’re leaving us to explore the outside world, where you’ll have many expenses. Keep it. If I need it, I’ll ask you for it.\"\nArix urged, \"Think of it as for the kids. It can buy them new clothes, and cover their medical expenses if they get sick.\"\nAfter a pause, Gwen agreed to take the money. With that settled, Arix said goodbye to everyone at the orphanage and left.\nShe made a special trip to thank Zenis, the veteran, and then she headed to the spaceship terminal.\nShe booked a ticket for a noon flight.\nOn the spaceship, Arix watched as the dreary Planet Waste faded from view. She turned her attention away and started looking up the five military academies on her opticomputer.\nThe Alliance was known as the Alliance of the Stars. It had five military academies in total, the first being the Koros Military Academy on Planet Koros. The lowest rank for a tutor at this academy was a Star-Class mecha warrior, and their president was a Supergiant-Class mecha pilot.\nGiven that there were only a handful of Supergiant-Class mecha pilots in the entire Alliance, the president was practically a living legend. This was probably why the Koros Military Academy was considered a holy place for countless mecha pilots, with 70% of the Alliance’s mecha pilots choosing to study there every year.\nThe Snorri Military Academy on Planet Snorri was somewhat complicated. Firstly, its tuition fees were ten times those of other military academies, attracting mainly wealthy heirs and socialites, along with some government officials’ children.\nSuccess at this school didn’t necessarily require talent but definitely demanded wealth or power.\nThe Snorri Military Academy was most renowned for its annual participation in the mecha league among the five military academies. They consistently used highly expensive mechas to secure an advantage in the competitions, which always aroused envy among the other academies.\nThe most laid-back was The Ceres Military Academy on Ceres, which primarily focused on biology and chemistry, especially drug development.\nThe academy involved extensive work with alien flora and fauna, keeping students and faculty busy with tasks like feeding mice to weeping flowers or milking cows with a hundred teats.\nStudents from The Ceres Military Academy were often called \"interstellar farmers,\" a moniker they embraced rather than resented.\nUnderestimating The Ceres Military Academy proved to be a grave mistake. On one occasion, a student from The Mulado Military Academy insulted The Ceres students online as \"mecha duds.\"\nThis led to all Alliance chemists ceasing potion supplies to the offender’s family until they disowned him.\nThe Mulado Military Academy on Planet Mulado was notable for its exclusivity, mainly recruiting for its Psychic Ware program.\nThe program’s demands were high, with most students unable to produce a single Psychic Ware in six months.\nThose who managed to produce one in three months were considered genius.\nPsychic Ware was crucial for enhancing a mecha pilot’s psychic power level, which was essential for operating mechas of corresponding power levels.\nHowever, the high cost of Psychic Ware often deterred many who wanted to join.\nFinally, The Hecaris Military Academy on Planet Hecaris, focusing on mecha manufacturing, was known for its inclusiveness.\nIts first president was a civilian mecha manufacturer, leading to a more open recruitment policy. Even students from Planet Waste had equal opportunities to compete for admission.\nHowever, The Hecaris Military Academy had the most stringent entrance exam of all academies due to its limited resources and the vast number of applicants—up to 50,000—with only the top 1,000 being admitted.\nAfter reviewing the information on the five major academies, Arix took a particular interest in The Hecaris Military Academy, feeling it was a bit of a long shot.\nAfter all, a recommendation letter didn’t guarantee direct admission; it merely provided her with an opportunity to be assessed. Whether or not Arix could secure admission would depend on her own abilities.\nAt that time, both Arix’s physical and psychic strengths were at Moon Class. According to the data, at least half of the candidates applying to The Hecaris each year had physical strength talents at Star Class or above.\nInitially, Arix felt a bit anxious, but then she realized something: she had already died once, so trying wouldn’t cause her any loss since she had nothing left to lose.\nA smirk of confidence flashed across Arix’s lips. She whispered to herself, \"Then, I’ll just give it my all. The Hecaris Academy, your Queen is coming!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 3: Arrival at Hecaris\nOn the spaceship, Arix was staying in the cheapest room. There were four beds in the room, but the other three were empty.\nThe room was totally silent, and after waking up, Arix leaned on the bed to enjoy the view outside.\nThrough the window of the spaceship, stars were scattered like gems, and the galaxy stretched like flowing water. Distant star systems emitted a soft glow, while nearby meteors streaked across the night sky, leaving behind brief but brilliant trails of light.\nAfter a long journey of five days and nights, the spaceship finally reached Hecaris. The landing port was in the biggest city on Hecaris.\nAs soon as Arix stepped off the spaceship, the scene in front of her was overwhelming. The place was packed with people, like ants on a hot pot.\nIt was the time of the annual enrollment of the Hecaris Military Academy, so every year during this season, Planet Hecaris was overrun with people.\nArix was so squeezed that she almost yelled out. In the end, she managed to make her way out of the arrival hall and finally left the huge interstellar hub.\n...\n\"To celebrate the academy enrollment, mechas at crazy low prices! First come, first served!\"\n\"Applicants for the academies get a 30% discount on all potions! An additional 20% off for the first 1000 customers, act fast!!\"\nShops on both sides of the street were bustling with promotions.\nArix, looking at the lively crowd and with three days to go before the assessment, couldn’t help but squeeze into a mecha shop to feast her eyes.\nThe reason it was just feasting her eyes was that, even at a slashed price, the mechas were still way beyond her reach, with prices reaching into the billions.\nArix’s eyes nearly stuck to the ten-meter-tall mechas in the shop.\nIt was a pity that a glass case separated the mechas, or else they would probably be covered in drool from all the window shoppers.\nJust then, Arix suddenly realized that she could sense the internal structure of the mechas using her psychic power. It felt like having X-ray vision.\nSwallowing her saliva, Arix got even more excited and scrutinized every mecha from head to toe.\nLuckily, the highest grade in the shop was Planet-Class mechas. If there were Star-Class mechas with LD chips, their owners might report a pervert to the interstellar police.\nAfter having her fill in the mecha shop, Arix, with a dismissive look from the shop assistant, casually went to the neighboring potion shop.\nIn her previous life on Earth, Arix was born into a very privileged family. Her father was a doctor, and her mother was a chemist. Influenced by her parents’ interdisciplinary backgrounds, Arix had been deeply interested in drug manufacturing and research from a young age.\nLater, she graduated with a Ph.D. and became a chemist herself. Just when she finally had the chance to make a big splash, she was accidentally killed by a gang on the street.\nArix sighed about her short and dramatic previous life, then turned her attention to the counter, where rows of colorful potions were displayed.\nThere were potions for detoxifying, healing, cancer prevention, longevity, and the most amazing of all, the Booster potions for upgrading one’s physique.\nFrom the lowest grade Boosters to the Planet-Class Boosters, there was a small screen in front of each potion, displaying its level, effects, and the chemist who created it.\nArix was staring hard at a Planet-Class Booster, priced at one million astrocredits. If she could get her hands on a Planet-Class Booster, she would be almost guaranteed a spot in the Hecaris Military Academy’s entrance examination.\nBut then she thought of the roughly ten thousand astrocredits lying in her opticomputer, and her burning desire was put down instantly.\nMaybe because Arix spent too long in front of the evolution potions, a salesperson came over and asked, \"Would you like one?\"\n\"No, thanks.\" After replying, Arix kept her last bit of dignity as a poor person and left the potion shop calmly.\nHowever, the moment she stepped out, Arix quickly searched for Planet-Class Boosters on the interstellar net.\nBoosters above Star Class were indeed secret recipes guarded by the Alliance. However, for Boosters below Planet Class, their manufacturing methods were as common as cooking videos, flooding all video websites.\nAfter watching a tutorial, Arix realized the biggest problem wasn’t making the potion. Just the cost of the ingredients for a Planet-Class Booster was already beyond all her current assets. If there were requirements for the purity of the materials, the cost would more than double.\nStubbornly, Arix went to a raw material store to check the prices and finally hung her head low in defeat.\nIf she didn’t know how to make potions, Arix would have accepted the result—but she knew how. Essentially, potions were just about purifying various materials with psychic power and mixing them together.\nAs long as one’s psychic power was strong enough, mass production was a matter of minutes.\n’Wait a second!’\nAn idea struck Arix, and her eyes lit up. She excitedly said to the materials shop owner, \"I want to buy ingredients for making potions!\"\nAlthough the shop owner was taken aback by Arix’s sudden change of demeanor, his professional demeanor quickly returned, and he responded enthusiastically, \"Alrighty!\"\nSoon after, Arix walked out of the materials store, carefully holding ingredients worth 50,000, treating them like treasures.\nThis caught the attention of a few thieves on the street, but upon closer inspection, they realized it was just a bunch of worthless materials and lost interest.\nOne of them thought he had spotted an easy target and eagerly followed Arix, and he felt duped when he saw just some unrecognizable stones and liquids.\nAnnoyed, he muttered under his breath to his companion, \"What bad luck, ran into a nutcase. Treating a pile of trash like treasure.\"\n\"The Hecaris Military Academy’s entrance exam is drawing near, and all sorts of people are on this planet now. I just saw someone dressed decently, but her jewelry was fake. Girls these days...sigh!\"\nHis companion, also feeling the sting of disappointment, couldn’t help but share his grievances.\nArix paid no attention to the thieves, and even if she had noticed them, she would have chosen to ignore them.\nHer mind was entirely focused on the pharmacological combinations for the Planet-Class Booster.\nWith her vast knowledge of pharmacology, Arix could quickly deduce the manufacturing process of a drug based on its effects. She soon figured out how to combine the ingredients to replicate the effects of a Planet-Class Booster.\nThis was similar to comparing genuine and counterfeit drugs in her previous life, where counterfeits could be made at a fraction of the cost to look just like the genuine product—though the effects might not be as good.\nAfter all, genuine drugs are the result of millions of lab trials to find the best outcome.\nArix booked the cheapest room in a hotel, one with shared bathrooms. Without even taking a look around, she dove into her work for two full days.\nCrushing, melting, extracting, purifying, merging, and finally, creating the medicine.\nFor several days, Arix followed tutorial videos, repeating these six steps until, the day before her entrance examination, her room echoed with her joyful laughter.\n\"I did it! Now I have the physical strength of a Planet Class.\"\nArix happily looked at her hands. She wanted to lightly punch the wall beside her but knew the dilapidated hotel might not withstand it.\nHer physical strength had leveled up, and her psychic strength was already at Moon-Class. Considering these improvements, if she still couldn’t pass the Hecaris Military Academy entrance examination, she would be too ashamed to return to Planet Waste and face Sister Gwen.\nHaving addressed her most pressing concern, Arix felt a deep sense of satisfaction. However, looking at the remaining nine Planet-Class Boosters, she became troubled again.\nShe was indeed short on money, but she couldn’t openly sell the Planet-Class Boosters she had made. If she carried those nine boosters worth millions of astrocredits, it would be like a toddler wandering the streets with a suitcase full of cash.\nAfter some thought, Arix decided to open a secret online store on the interstellarnet.\nThe Alliance values the protection of personal information, and ordinarily, the personal information of online store owners is inaccessible to the public, except for the military department.\nSome people, to be extra cautious, pay a personal information protection tax to the Interstellarnet Administration Bureau every month, ensuring that even the military can’t easily access their information.\nUnless a person is deemed by the Interstellarnet Administration Bureau to potentially destabilize the Alliance, or if the request to access someone’s data is approved by the admirals of the five major legions, that person’s information is completely secure.\nArix felt she wasn’t significant enough to attract the attention of the admirals, so with this tax payment, she would be entirely safe.\nArix got right to work. After going through the process of setting up an online store and marking the store owner information as highly confidential, she paid a personal information protection fee of 30,000 astrocredits.\nFinally, she received her contract, indicating she now owned an online store, albeit with just three square meters of virtual space on the interstellarnet.\nNow, she needed a Connective Pod equipped with a brain-machine interface (BMI). This device would connect her to the virtual world of the interstellarnet.\nIn this era, even the most basic hotel room would have a Connective Pod for accessing the interstellarnet.",

      "content": "Chapter 4: Online Shop\nArix lay down in the Connective Pod. As soon as she used her psychic power to touch the sensor, a gentle female voice welcomed her.\n\"Welcome to the Alliance’s interstellarnet.\"\nAfter the voice, Arix found herself standing on a bustling street. If she didn’t know she was just on the interstellarnet, she might have thought she had been transported to another world, again.\nAfter marveling for a moment, Arix opened her virtual opticomputer, clicked on the shop in her personal information, chose to enter, and in the blink of an eye, she was in a small room.\nShe reluctantly purchased a shop sign for 1,000 astrocredits, naming it Arix’s Potions, and hung it outside the virtual store. Then she bought the cheapest potion shop decoration package.\nShe displayed the nine virtual Planet-Class Boosters on the potion shelves and labeled the potion levels and effects, just like in the potion shop she had visited earlier.\nFor the \"Chemist\" section, Arix hesitantly filled in \"Master V.\"\nChemists are ranked from Particle Class, Stardust Class, Meteor Class, Comet Class, Moon-Class, Planet Class, Star-Class, Subgiant Class, to Supergiant-Class.\nArix couldn’t be sure of her own level. Since she had only produced a Planet-Class potion, she played it safe and claimed to be a Planet-Class chemist.\nAfter all, on the interstellarnet, anyone could claim any chemist level they liked, and customers took their chances when shopping.\nOn the interstellarnet, only officially certified stores sell guaranteed genuine products.\nWealthy people in the Alliance never buy these items online, as physical stores are obviously more secure choices.\nOfficial certification requires passing a potion exam held by the chemist association, and certification is only granted with proof from the association.\nArix was now only skilled in one potion and unaware of even the potions of the most basic class. Thus, it was highly unlikely that she could pass any official exams like those.\nWith this in mind, Arix set the price of each potion at 500,000 astrocredits and then logged off.\nJust as Arix logged off, a person dressed in worn-out clothes entered her store. The store was unmanned but equipped for automatic sales.\nThe person seemed somewhat anxious. When he walked into the store and immediately spotted the Planet-Class Boosters at the counter, his eyes widened with surprise.\nThis was Lexi. He was also an applicant for the Hecaris Military Academy this year.\nHe came from Planet Frontier, and a family fallen on hard times. To enable him to pass the entrance examination of the Hecaris Military Academy, his family had emptied all their savings, scraping together 600,000 astrocredits for Lexi to purchase a Planet-Class Booster.\nBecause the potions in physical stores were too expensive, Lexi thought to check the interstellarnet, where many had found quality goods at reasonable prices.\nHe was aware of the risk of counterfeit goods online, but with physical stores pricing Planet-Class Boosters at several million astrocredits, he felt he had no choice.\nHe swore he would leave a negative review if the potion turned out to be fake, and he’d even consider reporting the store to the Interstellarnet Administration Bureau to get it shut down, so as to prevent others from being scammed.\nAfter deliberating, Lexi mustered the courage to place an order. He filled in his address, paid, and immediately began to doubt his decision.\n\"I must be out of my mind. Who sells a Planet-Class potion for 500,000? It’s definitely a fake, but it’s too late for regrets now! God, please let it be real. And to the store owner, if you can hear me, I’ll promote your shop if it’s genuine.\"\nArix didn’t hear Lexi’s prayers, though. After hastily leaving the virtual world of the interstellarnet, she took a hot shower.\nJust as she was getting ready to sleep, a notification on her opticomputer woke her up: \"Dear Arix, your store has just completed a transaction. Please attend to it promptly.\"\nArix couldn’t sleep anymore. She opened the store management app and was greeted by the 500,000 astrocredits that had just been deposited into her account.\n\"Yay!\" Arix was so happy that she rolled around on her bed. She smiled as she rolled off, carefully packed a Planet-Class Booster in a cardboard box, and called a delivery robot to pick it up and send it off.\nAfter dispatching the product, Arix turned off her opticomputer and went back to bed to rest. She needed to start preparing for tomorrow’s entrance examination at the Hecaris Military Academy.\nSince Lexi was also on Hecaris, he received the package very quickly.\nHolding the light cardboard box, Lexi felt certain he had been scammed.\nAlthough he had never purchased any booster before, he was aware that if the potion was genuine, the seller would have used a specialized box for packaging. Instead, he was holding an ordinary cardboard box with some dirt stains on it.\nLexi’s smile turned increasingly bitter. He blamed himself for being foolish enough to believe that genuine goods could be found on the interstellarnet.\nAfter sighing countless times, Lexi decided to go livestreaming. He had lost 500,000 astrocredits and didn’t want others to be scammed like he was.\nHe opened his live streaming channel and even spent 10,000 astrocredits to secure a featured spot on the homepage. He wanted people entering the live streaming app to instantly find him.\nAfter titling the stream \"500,000 for a Planet-Class Booster?\" Lexi started the live broadcast.\nThis was peak viewing time, and many people joined the stream to see who else had been duped on the interstellarnet.\nThe viewer count soon reached 100,000, and the chat was filled with comments mocking the host.\n\"I just bought one from my uncle for 800,000 just for the cost. And here’s someone hoping against hope to get a Planet-Class Booster for 500,000.\"\n\"Thinking you can get a Planet-Class Booster for 500,000, haha, that’s hilarious.\"\n\"Is the host doing this to entertain us?\"\n\"Another fool who thinks he’s lucky.\"\nAs Lexi read the endless mocking comments, he felt utterly hopeless. He then took out the delivery package containing the potion and said, \"This box contains the Planet-Class Booster I purchased. Let’s open it and take a look.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 5: Live Streaming\nThe comments in the live stream kept rolling non-stop:\n\"Who would pack such an expensive Planet-Class Booster in a cardboard box? Totally a fake.\"\n\"Some folks just love a bargain. They always gamble on the cheap stuff, thinking they might get lucky and score the real deal.\"\n\"I’m out, definitely a fake. I’ve seen too many of these unboxing streams, and it’s always a bunch of smoke and mirrors.\"\nLexi was pretty chill about these comments. After getting scammed out of $500,000, he felt like nothing could rattle him anymore.\nHe quietly opened the cardboard box and took out the Planet-Class Booster from inside, holding the potion in his palm for the viewers to see closely.\n\"Ha, there’s actually a potion, huh. At least the seller wasn’t lying about that.\"\n\"Come on, drink it and see if it’s real.\"\n\"Don’t drink it, man. What if it’s poison and you end up pooping your brains out, haha.\"\n\"Hey! Don’t be so gross. People on Planet Koros are still trying to have dinner.\"\nAfter showing it off, Lexi opened the potion’s stopper.\nThen he told the viewers, \"I’m just a normal military student, and don’t have a rich family. My family emptied all their savings for the potion. Even if it’s fake, I won’t regret it because there’s no way I could afford a real Planet-Class Booster. I bought this from an interstellarnet shop called Arix’s Potions. If it’s real... well, even I don’t believe it could be.\"\nAfter saying that, Lexi resignedly gulped down the potion. But as soon as the potion hit his mouth, a bitter taste shot straight to his brain. That taste nearly knocked him out.\nLexi figured it must be some kind of poison. Then he threw up a few times, and grew even more convinced he’d bought a fake.\nHe couldn’t afford a Planet-Class Booster, but he’d heard enough from classmates who had. A real Planet-Class Booster didn’t taste bitter at all; it had a faint fragrance.\nIt was too late for regrets. When a sharp pain hit his body, Lexi passed out before he could even call an ambulance.\nThe viewers on the interstellar net watching the live stream had no idea what had happened to Lexi. On the screen, Lexi’s eyes were tightly shut, as if he was preparing for something.\nSome viewers were worried about Lexi. However, there was a noticeable rise and fall in his chest on the screen. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief and started to anticipate what would happen next.\nSome viewers, getting bored of waiting, started discussing again.\n\"I just searched for Arix’s Potions that the host mentioned, and there’s only one kind of potion there. 8 Planet-Class Boosters for just 500,000. Hah, the shop must not know that the cost of a Planet-Class Booster is over 500,000. Definitely a fake.\"\n\"Is it just me, or do you guys also feel bad for Lexi? His family doesn’t even have a million astrocredits.\"\n\"Really? Not having a million is considered poor now? Oh my, you must be a spoiled princess.\"\nTime ticked by. Half an hour later, just as many viewers were considering whether to call the police, Lexi’s surprised voice suddenly came from the live stream.\n\"Ah! Planet Class! My physique has really upgraded, the potion is real.\" Lexi excitedly screamed into the camera. It seemed words weren’t enough to express his excitement, as he then passionately kissed his opticomputer a few times.\nThe viewers were first shocked by the enlarged lips on the screen, but then the chat exploded.\n\"Bang! In your face! You skeptics!\"\n\"Lexi’s so lucky, I’m going to buy one to try.\"\n\"Yeah, a Planet-Class Booster for just 500,000 astrocredits, half the price of a physical store. I’m tempted to buy one too.\"\n\"Wait, what was that one person saying earlier?\"\n\"Arix’s Potions, 8 Planet-Class Boosters.\"\n\"Damn! That’s the one, I’m heading there now, you guys keep chatting.\"\n\"Wait for me, count me in.\"\nArix, still asleep, had no idea her online shop had blown up.\nWhen many viewers arrived at Arix’s Potions, there were only product descriptions left on the counter.\nThe crowd went wild, leaving messages on the online shop begging for the potion, and some viewers who couldn’t buy the potion went back to the live stream to complain about those who were quick to purchase.\n\"Damn, someone just snagged 3 bottles in one go.\"\n\"Huh! I got one, selling it for 800,000, if anyone’s interested.\"\n\"You’re so greedy, flipping it for a 300,000 astrocredit profit.\"\n\"I don’t care about flipping. I want it. OP, I messaged you privately, please reply, desperately need the Planet-Class potion!\"\nThe next day, when Arix opened her opticomputer, her account had an extra 4.5 million astrocredits. She quickly realized it must be because all the potions were sold out.\nArix checked her shop on the opticomputer, only to find the shelves empty and the shop flooded with over a thousand messages from buyers wanting the potion.\nArix was thrilled, eager to make more money, especially since she really wanted her own mecha. But today, she couldn’t make any potions because, unfortunately, she had to attend the entrance exam.\nAfter some thought, Arix posted a seemingly heartless announcement in her shop.\nDear customers, I am aware of everyone’s demand. However, I regret to inform you that due to personal reasons, the restocking date for the next batch is uncertain.\nSincerely,\nArix’s Potions\nAfter posting the announcement, Arix muted the frantic comment notifications from her online shop. She took out the remaining eight potions and called for a delivery robot.\nOnce everything was settled, Arix realized it was already 7:30 in the morning. Her exam started at 9:30. So, she stopped paying attention to the online happenings and set out for the Hecaris Military Academy.\nWhen Arix arrived at the Hecaris Military Academy, the area in front of the school was already packed with people from various planets who had come to take the exam.\nToday was the day of the entrance assessment, and the Hecaris Military Academy allowed people other than students to approach the school.\nAs a result, many who were usually curious about the school also came to visit. They gathered at the gate, excitedly peeking into the Hecaris Military Academy from time to time.",

      "content": "Chapter 6: Teaming Up, Game On\nThe candidates began to enter the venue. These individuals had clearly prepared for this exam for a long time. They walked and talked, familiar with several military academies and the upcoming events.\nOne candidate excitedly said, \"The Tournament of The Five is starting soon, I’m so excited, I wonder which military academy will take first place this year.\"\n\"That has to be the Koros Military Academy. Everyone who can take the Koros Military Academy exam is a genius.\"\n\"I’m betting on the Hecaris Military Academy. You know, this year, the grandson of an admiral is also taking the entrance exam.\"\n\"It’s fine to bet on anyone, just not The Ceres Military Academy. They’re lazier than tardigrades. They’ve been last every year for decades.\"\n\"The Snorri Military Academy isn’t bad either. Their candidates are outrageously rich every year. Money is their cheat code. I think they went too far in last year’s competition, blatantly cheating right under everyone’s noses.\"\n\"Damn! I knew it! Last year’s exam, that guy fell and then found the exit? That’s ridiculous!\"\nArix, looking at the school entrance that resembled a concert scene, felt somewhat overwhelmed. She made her way through the crowd more discreetly, checked in successfully, and entered the military school.\nAs she walked through the gate, she took a deep breath.\nShe followed the signs to the check-in area and handed her recommendation letter to the teacher. She quietly began to wait.\n\"Information verified, pay attention to the information received on your opticomputer. Arix, right? Good luck.\"\nArix’s opticomputer received an official message from the Hecaris Military Academy, stating that the school had authorized her opticomputer.\n\"Thank you, ma’am.\"\nAfter saying goodbye to the staff, Arix followed the directions on her opticomputer and arrived at the designated examination hall of the military school.\nIn the spacious examination hall, a soft blue light enveloped everything, with countless dark gold codes faintly glowing with a cold light.\nArix was thoroughly impressed. These massive pods were nothing like anything she’d seen in her run-down hotel. All the equipment was brand new, even fitted with high-end ambient lighting.\nThese were the giant Connective Pods exclusive to the top five military academies.\nArix spent a long time closely examining a pod next to her, admiring it. After she had taken it all in, she walked towards the entrance marked by a light screen.\nA beam of light scanned Arix’s body at the entrance.\nThe screen automatically displayed a message: \"Identity confirmed, Arix, please enter.\"\nOnce inside, Arix faced a sea of heads. There were so many people, she felt she couldn’t count them all. The thought of all these people being her competition made Arix feel a slight bit of worry.\nIn the center of the examination hall, there was a display showing the number of new students, with the figures constantly changing. Arix counted, and the numbers had already reached six digits.\n\"Hey, a pretty girl just arrived,\" a candidate who had been watching the entrance whistled nonchalantly.\nThe surrounding candidates also turned their gaze towards Arix.\n\"Want to team up, gorgeous? I can help you,\" the nonchalant candidate continued.\nAs soon as he finished his sentence, his companion angrily covered his mouth and dragged him away while scolding, \"Is now really the time to be hitting on girls? She’d kill you if she found out about this, you know?\"\nThe nonchalant candidate immediately fell silent. He pressed his lips together, gave Arix a regretful look, and then let his teammate drag him away resignedly.\nThe candidates looked at Arix’s frail appearance and tacitly chose to ignore her. They decided to continue focusing on other newly entered candidates with more potential.\nOccasionally, when a strong-looking candidate entered the hall, people would swarm over like wolves spotting meat, eagerly inviting them to join their teams.\n’Ouch, this is almost insulting!’\nArix thought, speechless at the scene before her.\n\"Um...\" a timid voice sounded.\nTurning her head, Arix noticed a boy even shorter than herself hesitantly looking at her.\nArix sized up the boy. He was very thin and seemed like he wouldn’t be very strong in a fight.\nJudging by the reactions of the others just now, this boy probably couldn’t find anyone to team up with.\nArix put on a friendly smile and said, \"Are you looking to team up with me? Don’t worry, I won’t mind if you’re not strong.\"\n\"Ah, no, no, no, I already have a team!\" the boy quickly denied, shaking his head.\nArix’s smile gradually faded, replaced by an indifferent expression. \"Oh, then what do you want? Make it quick, I’m busy.\"\n\"Do you need information for the entrance exams? It’s just ten astrocredits,\" the boy said cautiously, then added, \"Interested?\"\nArix looked at the boy for a moment, taking a deep breath to calm the annoyance bubbling inside her. Then she transferred ten astrocredits to him.\nTaking the information, she found a quiet corner, leaned against the wall, and started reading attentively.\nDespite its low price, the information was incredibly useful, even including references to exam content.\nThe document indicated that students applying to any of the five military academies would participate in the exam together. All students would connect to a specific location in the interstellarnet world via neural interfaces to enter the test simulation.\nThe simulation environment was harsh, filled with wild beasts and humanity’s arch-enemies: the insectoids. If a candidate died in the simulation, they would be eliminated.\nAfter three days, when the exam concluded, the top one thousand scoring students from all the academies would gain admission.\nAdditionally, anyone ranking in the top ten on the strongest newcomer list endorsed by all five academies would not only receive a full scholarship, but also a generous reward from the Alliance.\nArix was slightly envious of the rewards for the top ten, but she knew it was a long shot for her. So, she could only swallow her envy.\nHaving read the specifics of the exam, Arix felt she had a good grasp of what to expect. ’It’s essentially a survival challenge, right? I’ve watched plenty of survival videos online. Those should come in handy... right?’\nSurvival in the wild didn’t seem too daunting. The only real issue was her lack of experience with insectoids. She wasn’t sure if insecticide would work on them.\n’Maybe I should test my latest enhanced insecticide formula on those weird bugs.’\nThe more Arix thought about it, the more eager she became, wishing the exam would start right away.\n\"It’s unexpected that members of the Alliance’s top five noble families are all participating in this year’s military academy exams. And they’re all high-profile, at least heirs to their respective families. They’ve never all joined the academy exams together in the past. Is there some inside story this year?\" a candidate nearby murmured.\nArix glanced at the two boys whispering next to her. She had seen mentions of the Alliance’s five noble families on the interstellarnet, but the information was mostly flattery, highly distorted. Therefore, her knowledge about these families was virtually non-existent.\nSo, she casually moved closer to the two candidates, hoping to eavesdrop on some information. The place was crowded, and the candidates didn’t notice Arix’s approach. They were comfortably chatting about the gossip surrounding the top five noble families.\n\"I heard it’s because the heiress of the Horcruxes family is also taking the military academy entrance exam this time. The other four families followed suit. If anyone could marry her, their family would never run out of Psychic Ware!\"\n\"Shh, no wonder. I don’t know if we’re unlucky or lucky. I heard even the richest family’s only child is here this time. Us ordinary folks are doomed to be just stepping stones for the five noble families.\"\n\"Tsk tsk, you’re thinking too small. Just imagine, if by some luck, we manage to get on the good side of one of the top five families, that could be our big break.\"\n\"Ah, why didn’t I think of that? You’re the smart one, dude.\"\n\"Hehe, hey, look, it’s the president of the Hecaris Military Academy.\"\nArix also turned her gaze towards the central video in the examination hall. A 15-second countdown appeared on the huge screen until the numbers hit zero.\nAn elderly man appeared on the screen. Contrary to Arix’s expectation of a stern and serious president, the man on the screen always maintained a smile, appearing very approachable.\n\"Hello, new students. I am Gunder, the president of the Hecaris Military Academy. First of all, I welcome each and every one of you who is participating in the assessment. I am honored by your choice of our academy. I wish you all the best in the assessment and urge you to strive for the top spot. Without further ado, please welcome Mr. Mark Marlone, who will be overseeing this examination and will explain the rules to you.\"\nAfter Gunder’s applause, the screen switched to a man in military uniform, Mark Marlone.\nMarlone’s deep features were steady, his eyes sharp as an eagle’s, making the candidates feel uneasy. Many instantly quieted down.",

      "content": "Chapter 7: Exams Started\nMarlone was just sitting there, but he made everyone feel a kind of pressure. But Arix wasn’t scared of Marlone. Instead, Arix felt kind of drawn to him because of his typical soldier vibe.\nMarlone looked around the room before he said, \"First off, our test isn’t a video game. We use the latest brain-machine interfaces to bring out the real skills of the trainees. So, everything you face in the virtual world will feel super real, including injuries and pain. The test isn’t totally safe. Every year, some trainees get their psychic world messed up or get hurt by accident. Minor injuries in the psychic world can be fixed with advanced Psychic Ware; but if it’s a bad injury, the injured person could end up in a coma. I’m warning you guys again, think about your families when you’re pushing yourself hard. It’s not shameful to quit when it’s risky!\"\n\"That’s my advice and warning to you all. One last time, got it?\" Marlone said in a really serious and deep voice.\n\"Got it!!\" All the trainees stood tall and shouted together.\nMarlone kept a very serious face the whole time. Only after everyone answered did he relax his face a bit. He nodded lightly and said, \"Now, I’ll explain the rules for the next three days. Listen quietly.\"\nArix listened quietly and quickly understood the main points of the test. This test wasn’t just for students from the Hecaris Military Academy; students from four other military schools would also join the freshman test.\nCalling it a test was one thing, but it was also kind of a competition. Only the top performers would get a chance to enter the military school. The competition was mainly about earning points, mostly by taking down insectoids. The more insectoids you take down, especially the tougher ones, the more points you get. Also, taking out other competitors could score you their points.\nPlus, there would be referees watching the whole test. At the end, they might give extra points based on how the trainees did in the simulation.\"\nAfter Marlone finished speaking, the students started to whisper among themselves.\n\"The competition starts in half an hour. On the last page of the info pack you got earlier, there’s a white pill stuck to it. This pill is super packed with energy. After you take it, you won’t need to eat for three days. Once you take it, your Psychic Incarnation will also show up in the virtual testing ground.\"\nRight after Marlone finished his sentence, he noticed that the trainees had almost all swallowed their pills at the same time.\n\"You didn’t really have to take it so soon, the competition hasn’t even started. Even if you take down insectoids now, you won’t earn any points...\" Marlone mumbled quietly.\n\"Ummm... maybe tell us the important stuff a bit sooner next time?\"\n\"Okay... thanks... I guess?\"\n\"Seriously? This is going to be our teacher?\"\nAs moans filled the air, all the trainees peacefully closed their eyes. Their Psychic Incarnations quickly entered the interstellarnet world.\nMarlone, feeling awkward, touched his nose, thinking about leaving, when he noticed there was one who hadn’t taken the pill.\n\"Huh? You didn’t take it?\" Marlone looked at Arix in surprise.\nArix gave Marlone a complicated look. She was curious about the ingredients of the pill, so she hadn’t immediately taken it like the others.\n\"Before I answer your question, you might want to check out what’s behind you,\" Arix said sympathetically, looking at Marlone in the video.\nMarlone stiffened, carefully turning his head to look behind, only to see the president of the Hecaris Military Academy staring at him with a look that could kill.\n\"President Gunder, I can explain...\"\nThe screen went black just as Arix thought she could hear Marlone’s wail.\nAs the Hecaris Military Academy’s examinees entered the interstellarnet, people from the Alliance were surprised to discover that the exam had started early.\n\"Huh? Wasn’t it supposed to start in half an hour?\"\n\"Look closely, it seems that only the Hecaris Military Academy’s examinees have started half an hour early. But killing insectoids at this time won’t earn them any points. I’m a bit puzzled by this move.\"\n\"Isn’t the Hecaris Military Academy just wasting their energy by doing this? Are they intentionally trying to let others win? That’s way too generous.\"\n\"I don’t know if the Hecaris Military Academy can win this time, but they’re definitely the best opponents. All I want to say is, I’d love a dozen opponents like them, thank you!\"\nMeanwhile, in the Alliance military school’s conference room, the examiners of the new students from the other four military schools exchanged glances. Then, they all turned their gaze towards Marlone from the Hecaris Military Academy.\nMarlone decisively closed his eyes, now swollen with a mix of purple and red. He didn’t want to face the harsh reality.\nAfter a moment of silence, Solis, the examiner from the Koros Military Academy and usually a peacemaker, stepped forward to comfort Marlone. \"Hey, look at this. The freshmen from the Hecaris Military Academy aren’t that foolish. They’ve avoided the dangers they needed to and have knocked out and tied up the insectoids they’ve encountered. It seems they’re planning to kill them once the competition officially starts to earn points. You have to admit, students are getting smarter these days.\"\nMarlone, giving up on struggling, half-opened one eye and glanced at the live stream. It was just like Solis had said. Feeling a bit better, he nodded at Solis as a way to say thanks.\n\"This student named Arix is quite interesting. Out of everyone at the Hecaris Military Academy, she’s the only one who didn’t take the pill. Really stands out, doesn’t she?\" said Laiden, the examiner from the Snorri Military Academy.\nHe was lounging back in his chair, dressed in a luxurious white uniform with gold trim. His sharp features carried an aristocratic elegance, though at the moment, his graceful face was marred by a regretful smirk.\nShella, the examiner from the Mulado Military Academy, was sitting coolly in a soft chair, dressed in a purple dress.\nShe glanced at the video. On the screen, Arix was sniffing and licking the pill but didn’t swallow it. Seeing this, Shella frowned and then silently looked away.\nShella’s features were delicate, making her appear somewhat fragile. However, no one in the room dared to underestimate her. When speaking to her, many even acted a bit cautiously and pleasingly.\nAfter all, not only was Shella from the Horcruxes family, but she was also a Star-Class Psychic Ware maker.\nHer status was very high, so she usually didn’t need to attend events like the freshman exam and was only expected to show up for ceremonial occasions. She had come specifically this time because her niece was taking the entrance exam.\n\"This kid started analyzing the pill’s ingredients instead of just taking it. She’d make a good chemist,\" said Mendez, the examiner from the Ceres Military Academy. He was dressed in a light green uniform and wore somewhat old-fashioned gold-rimmed glasses, which added an air of wisdom to his already handsome appearance.\nMarlone didn’t want the conversation to continue dwelling on his embarrassment, so he quickly changed the subject, \"The movements of the five noble families this time are quite significant. It’s rare for their members to take part in the exam, and now we have two of them. Shella, Mendez, you’d better keep an eye on your cubs. But why are you suddenly placing so much importance on this exam? Is something about to happen within the Alliance?\"\nSolis frowned and replied, \"It’s not the end of the world, but it’s not far off. The Alliance’s upper echelons just received news that a pureblood royal is getting in one of the Empire’s military schools.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 8: A Crisis\nMarlone was shocked, almost losing his composure. \"Pureblood royal! Doesn’t that mean their psychic power and physique are beyond Supergiant Class? I thought that was just a rumor, but it’s actually true?\"\nEven Solis, usually so even-tempered, couldn’t help but feel disgusted when thinking about the warmongers of the Empire. \"The Empire and the Alliance have been at peace for so many years simply because the two sides are evenly matched. Now, with a Supergiant from the royal family potentially tipping the scales... I’m afraid the warmongers in the Empire will start stirring up trouble again.\"\nMarlone, reminded of the hellish scenes on those planets, felt both heartache and growing anger. He said softly, \"The warmongers of the Empire are nothing but scum, wreaking havoc on countless galaxies at the edge. They meddle in planetary politics, causing division and civil wars. And what’s left in their wake? Cannon fire, bloodshed, and civilizations destroyed in an instant.\"\nShella and Mendez remained silent in their seats, and finally, it was Laiden who spoke lightly, \"The only enemy of the Alliance should be the insectoids. Once the Alliance and the Empire go to war, it will be the end of humanity.\"\nHearing this, Marlone felt as if his deepest pain had been touched. He sank back into his chair, defeated, and closed his eyes.\nHe understood all too well that if the two strongest nations began to fight, it would only provide opportunities for insectoid invasions.\nThis was something he understood, and the people of the Alliance understood; however, the warmongering faction of the Empire seemed not to. Their minds were filled only with thoughts of invading lands and resources.\nThe air turned somewhat heavy, as everyone knew that if the two nations began to fight, they would face a matter of life and death.\nAfter a moment of silence, Solis said, \"I believe that as long as the threat of the insectoids exists, the Alliance and the Empire won’t go that far. However, that doesn’t stop the Empire from wanting to control us. Four years from now, when that pureblood royal graduates, the mecha competition will determine the future situation between the Alliance and the Empire. Losing that game would push all of us into a relentless war.\"\nLaiden smirked mischievously, almost taking pleasure in the disaster. \"Tsk, tsk, the freshmen this year are really pitiful, carrying a burden even we can’t bear before they’ve even grown. But, I’m actually quite looking forward to it. Speaking of which, among the heirs of the five major noble families this time, who will be the leader?\"\nAs soon as these words fell, the friendly looks in the eyes of the five people present turned cold and sharp. The camaraderie they had just shared was slowly replaced by a growing desire to compete.\nMeanwhile, Arix had figured out the components of the pill. Just one minute before the competition was about to start, she finally swallowed the pill.\nWhen she opened her eyes again, what came into view was an unremarkable primeval forest. Tall, ancient trees stood majestically, and dappled sunlight fell upon her. She heard birds chirping in the distance and the murmur of a stream nearby.\nAnyone unaware they were in the interstellarnet’s virtual world would think they were truly in a real jungle.\nWhile marveling at the high technology, Arix also remained vigilant of her surroundings.\nSome arguing voices came from behind. After hearing them, Arix looked around for a moment and then swiftly climbed up a tree, skillfully concealing herself in the canopy.\nA boy’s voice, tinged with urgency and a slight tremor, carried over from nearby. \"The people from Hecaris are so despicable. They actually entered the simulation early, trapped the insectoids, and then killed them off at the start. Now they’re all leading in points.\"\nAnother voice joined the conversation, agreeing, \"I get it, they’re all trash from Planet Waste. Lowly people can only come up with such dirty tricks.\" His tone was filled with arrogance and disdain.\nThe voices grew closer. Arix looked down and saw two boys, one taller than the other, wearing the same military uniform as hers, emerging from the dense forest.\nThe golden lion emblem on their chests immediately told Arix that these were two rich kids from the Snorri Military Academy.\nTo distinguish the examinees of each school in the competition, emblems were used as markers:\n- The Koros Military Academy’s emblem was a crescent moon.\n- The Snorri Military Academy had the Golden Lion.\n- The Ceres Military Academy featured a test tube.\n- The Mulado Military Academy’s emblem was a cherry blossom.\n- And the Hecaris Military Academy was represented by the dire wolf.\nAfter the two figures disappeared, Arix emerged from the canopy.\nWith her skills, she could have easily taken out the two boys, but given the uncertain situation at the start, she decided it was best not to stir up unnecessary trouble.\n\"There are plenty of materials for making medicine in this simulation. I wonder if I can make some insect repellent or insecticide. And not having any medicine for self-defense feels pretty unsafe,\" Arix mumbled to herself, then picked a direction and started walking.\nWhile gathering minerals and plants for making medicine, she encountered several insectoids. However, she quickly dealt with them.\nEvery time Arix encountered other examinees, she would hide to avoid conflict. This was partly because of the risk of getting eliminated herself and partly because eavesdropping provided her with valuable information.\nThe heirs of the five noble families had formed significant groups of examinees in their respective military academies.\n- The leader of the Koros Military Academy’s group was Zephyr, the heir from the Calix family, one with lots of famous commanders. He was currently leading in points.\n- The Snorri Military Academy’s group was led by Elio, the heir from the mecha-making Lasair family. He was currently in third place in points, thanks to his financial advantages.\n- The Ceres Military Academy’s group was led by Varden, the heir from the chemist Brant family. He was currently at the bottom, ranked fifth in points.\n- The leader of the Mulado Military Academy’s group was Sirinna, the heir from the Rinn family, famous for making nice Psychic Wares. She was the only female leader among the five groups of examinees, and she was ranked second in points, closely trailing the first place.\nThe situation for the Hecaris Military Academy was quite grim. They had an early advantage, but this also made them the target of hatred from the other four military academies.\nThe leaders of the other four academies even began encouraging their members to take down students from the Hecaris Military Academy. As a result, many examinees from the Hecaris Military Academy were eliminated early in the game.\nFortunately, among the students from the Hecaris, there was an heir from the Kering family, Drexel, who possessed Supergiant-Class talent.\nWithout him, the Hecaris Military Academy might have already been wiped out, leaving only examinees from the other four academies on the field.",

      "content": "Chapter 9: A Chemistry Genius\nThe more Arix thought about it, the luckier she felt. At the start, she had considered joining up with folks from the Hecaris Military Academy, but she decided against it.\nShe figured if she joined the group, her gathering of herbs would slow everyone down and annoy some people. To avoid trouble, she ditched the idea.\nIf she had stuck with the main group, she would surely be on the list of those eliminated by now.\nIn this virtual world, students with Star-Class talents were everywhere, while those weaker ones with Planet-Class talents were a dime a dozen.\nArix was quite aware of this. She knew she might seem no different from an insectoid in others’ eyes—both were just there to give away points.\nJust as she thought of insectoids, Arix frowned and looked behind her. She heard some odd noises coming from there, getting closer to her position.\nQuickly climbing a tree to get a better view, Arix looked in that direction.\nA blood-covered person was running towards her, closely chased by five huge insectoids.\nThese insectoids, as big as elephants and looking a lot like ants, didn’t scare Arix much. But bugs always made her skin crawl a bit.\nIf there was just one insectoid, Arix might have tried to save this fellow student from the Hecaris Military Academy.\nBut with five of them, she knew she had no chance to save the person, and there was a 100% chance she’d get knocked out of the game along with them.\nArix wasn’t dumb; she knew the smartest thing to do was to run.\nBut humans definitely can’t outrun these giant ants. After all, they’ve got six legs. In no time, those creatures were only 10 meters away from Arix.\nThat’s when Arix sadly realized she couldn’t outrun the insectoids, also... the heavily injured dude had actually caught up with her.\nThat injured student was Drexel Kering. He glanced at the school badge on Arix’s chest and frowned. It seemed like he made up his mind and said, \"You better run, I’ll hold them off.\"\n\"What? What about you?\" Arix was shocked, not expecting such kindness in the world.\nDrexel took a moment from his heavy breathing to glance at Arix. Even now, he was incredibly calm. \"Seriously? Instead of hesitating here, you might want to focus on getting away.\"\n\"...\" Arix felt scolded without hearing a single bad word. Weighing her options, she decisively left Drexel behind and ran forward.\nMeanwhile, Drexel used his psychic power to create an invisible barrier, stopping the spiders in their tracks.\nDrexel was never too much of a good guy. He helped Arix only because they were both students from the Hecaris Military Academy.\nHe knew he shouldn’t have put himself in danger so easily. However, as the heir to the Kering family and with the Hecaris Military Academy being supported by his family, he couldn’t just abandon anyone from the academy, or anyone who might potentially join.\nFor Arix, Drexel gave up his chance to escape. The audience watching the live stream on the interstellarnet blew up the comment section at this.\n\"Poor Drexel. That girl wasn’t worth saving; she just left him behind.\"\n\"Drexel led those five insectoids away just to save students from the Hecaris Military Academy before. Now, he has to stay and fight for them again. These are five Planet-Class insectoids. The no-goods from the Hecaris Military Academy should just give up and not drag Drexel down.\"\n\"Drexel is in danger. Fighting just one insectoid without a mecha is hard enough. Now there are five, he’s doomed.\"\n\"This year’s test is insane. Weren’t Planet-Class insectoids always the final challenge in previous years? And now there are five all at once... Really? What was the test designer thinking?\"\nAt that moment, in the virtual arena on the interstellarnet, the insectoids were furiously attacking Drexel with their sharp forelegs.\nDrexel held on for a whole minute. When he felt Arix should have escaped, he finally dropped the barrier. Then he quickly took out a sword he had bought for a lot of money from his backpack.\nOne insectoid was excited to see Drexel’s psychic power barrier gone. With a hiss, it lunged at Drexel’s waist with its scary teeth.\nThe other four insectoids, using their sharp limbs, slashed at Drexel’s calves with terrifying speed.\nDrexel leaped up and landed on the back of an insectoid. With a flash of his sword, a huge head fell from the neck of the insectoid, and its massive body collapsed the next moment.\nUnfortunately, the death of their companion didn’t scare off the other four insectoids. They attacked Drexel even more fiercely.\nThese monsters were very tough to handle. After a long struggle, Drexel finally killed two more insectoids. But at the same time, his injuries became more severe. His hand gripping the sword was soaked in blood and trembling uncontrollably.\nWith a grunt, Drexel spat out a mouthful of blood.\nHis body was at its limit, too exhausted to fight the two remaining insectoids. As Drexel passed out, he murmured with some guilt, \"Grandpa would be so disappointed in me...\"\nArix didn’t mean to leave Drexel behind. After reaching a safe distance, she quickly combined the basic tools she carried with the chemical materials she had found. In her panic, she even failed a few times, which was rare for her. But in the end, she managed to make the insecticide.\nOn her way back with the insecticide, she saw Drexel covered in blood, with several huge insectoids about to tear him to pieces.\nArix was startled. She threw the insecticide potion directly at the head of the insectoid that was about to attack Drexel.\nAs the glass bottle shattered, the pure white gas inside was inhaled by two of the insectoids.\nThe massive bodies of the insectoids wobbled a few times before they fell to the ground, lifeless.\nAfter sighing in relief, Arix approached Drexel.\nShe wasn’t worried about Drexel being dead because in this exam competition, if a student dies, their Psychic Incarnation is directly teleported out of the interstellarnet.\nSince his projection was still in the arena, it meant Drexel was severely injured at most but not dead.",

      "content": "Chapter 10: Saving Drexel\nIn the cave, Arix had just finished taking care of Drexel’s injuries. She stared straight at the handsome guy sleeping in front of her, her eyes flickering with intense struggle.\nShe was torn between saving him or not. If she saved him, she’d use up all her meds. If she didn’t, she’d feel guilty.\nAfter a bit of thinking, Arix, still undecided, opened her opticomputer and clicked on \"Logistics Supplement\" in the exam section.\nA dazzling array of weapons, meds, and food appeared before her eyes, pricking her already vulnerable heart.\nA basic nutrient solution was 10,000 astrocredits a dose; a pure steel sword was 500,000 astrocredits; a low-tier healing potion was a million a pop...\nArix took a deep breath to hold back the curses lodged in her throat.\nOutside, a basic nutrient solution that cost ten was marked up a thousand times in this pay-to-win store. And the low-tier potions were even worse; what cost 1,000 astrocredits outside was now a million here in the Logistics Supplement.\nArix was on the verge of tears. If only she had checked the tutorial on making low-tier healing potions before entering the exam, she wouldn’t be in this predicament, knowing full well it was a trap but having no choice but to step into it.\nFinally, Arix clenched her teeth, shut her eyes tight, and bought a low-tier healing potion. She comforted herself non-stop. If that guy hadn’t taken on those five insectoids, she wouldn’t have had the chance to make insecticida. And that would have meant elimination for her.\nThough that was the logic, Arix still felt so heartbroken that she bit her lips hard.\nAn NPC that looked like an angel appeared mid-air. Despite his cuteness and almost instant delivery, Arix still left a one-star review to vent her anger.\nThe little angel’s eyes instantly filled with tears. He turned to leave with swallowed anger.\nArix, cruel and indifferent, turned around. She poured the potion into Drexel’s mouth, deliberately leaving a drop. She wanted to see if she could analyze its components.\nArix first smelled it, then carefully tasted the potion.\nAfter analyzing all the ingredients, Arix stared blankly at the empty potion bottle in her hand.\nThese ingredients, worth just a few dozen astrocredits, had cost her a million. And this was all happening in a virtual world.\nArix rolled her eyes and said sarcastically, \"The five academies might as well go rob in the streets. It’d look better than this.\"\nMaybe it was because the potion worked well, or maybe Drexel was just naturally strong, but as Arix was still muttering, Drexel had already woken up. He looked around the cave and then focused on Arix.\n\"Did you save me?\" Drexel seemed surprised as he sized up the small, slim girl in front of him.\nHearing the voice, Arix looked up at Drexel, her smile not quite reaching her eyes as she retorted, \"Who else? You think someone else would spend a million to get you a healing potion?\"\nDrexel might have been a bit proud, but he was very grateful to the girl who saved him. He replied, \"Thanks. I’m Drexel Kering. And you are?\"\nWhen Arix heard the young man’s name was Drexel, she thought she was hearing things. In disbelief, she asked, \"Drexel Kering? The guy who leads the team from the Hecaris Military Academy? How did you end up in such a mess? If I hadn’t... saved you in time, you would have been eliminated by now.\"\nArix paused when she was about to mention the insecticida, subtly changing the subject. It wasn’t that she was wary of Drexel; they just weren’t close enough for her to reveal all her secrets.\nDrexel saw the shock on Arix’s face and felt uncomfortable, touching his nose awkwardly. \"I didn’t expect this year’s entrance exam to be so tough. Students from the other four military schools were robbing us, and to make things worse, the insectoids that usually appear as the final challenge were everywhere this year. I got badly injured trying to take down a Subgiant-Class insectoid. Just when I finally managed to kill it, five Planet-Class insectoids showed up.\"\nArix fell silent, realizing something was off with the exam. She had thought she’d been scammed by the person who sold her the info, but it turned out the exam had been made more difficult.\nThinking this over, Arix looked up at Drexel and asked, \"So you have no idea what’s going on either?\"\nDrexel thought for a moment and replied, \"If it were before, I might have thought it was because of Cirilla, the heir of the Rinn family. But since the Subgiant-Class insectoid, I’m not so sure. After all, a family heir shouldn’t have the power to influence the military academy’s exam.\"\nArix was a bit disappointed. Seeing Drexel looking even more troubled than herself, she got an idea and said with a twinkle in her eye, \"Instead of sitting ducks, why don’t we team up? We can share the points we get from killing insectoids. Sounds fair, right?\"\nDrexel gave Arix a look as if she were crazy. \"You sure that’s fair?\"\nArix was displeased. \"Hey, watch that look. Don’t forget, I saved you from two Planet-Class insectoids.\"\nDrexel was taken aback, not having fully realized it. The girl in front of him was lean, she looked like she could snap at any moment. From her appearance, Drexel couldn’t see any sign that she could have saved him from two insectoids.\nAfter a moment’s hesitation, Drexel asked curiously, \"Speaking of which... how did you save me from those two Planet-Class insectoids?\"\n\"I’ll tell you if you agree with the deal,\" Arix raised an eyebrow.\nDrexel nodded promptly. He would have agreed just for Arix saving him, let alone anything else.\n...\nIn a thicket on the battlefield, two sneaky figures peered through the bushes, scouting the surroundings.\nCountless insectoid limbs were scattered across the ground, and the deep green blood of the insects corroded the earth, emitting a foul stench.\nNumerous insectoids were devouring each other, evolving in the process.",

      "content": "Chapter 11: The Kering Family\nArix, looking at the dense swarm of insectoids, felt relieved that she could handle this sight; a regular person might have fainted of fright at such a scene.\nDrexel retracted his gaze from the observation and nudged Arix, a mix of nervousness and excitement in his voice, \"This is an insectoid nest. You’re starting with something this thrilling? I like it, though.\"\nArix rolled her eyes at the eager Drexel and whispered, \"Get ready, 1, 2, 3, throw!\"\nThey hurled at least twenty potions into the center of the nest. The disturbed insectoids, ready to attack, suddenly fell to the ground. In just a moment, only a few low-level insectoids were left, frantically circling in confusion.\nArix and Drexel exchanged a look and silently took care of the remaining few.\nAfterward, Drexel, looking at the corpses of the insects, said with a bit of hesitation, \"It would be great if real insectoids were this easy to kill. Sadly, it’s just a holographic game.\"\nDrexel’s words piqued Arix’s curiosity. \"Are real insectoids that terrifying?\"\nDrexel glanced at Arix, his expression unusually serious, \"The insectoids known to the Alliance include worker, parasitic, mutant, and queen classes. Worker insectoids, like these corpses, are just the bottom rung of insectoid society and pose no threat to the Alliance. Even the mutant insectoids, which can command others and have strength comparable to Supergiant-Class, only pose a limited threat to the Alliance. But the parasitic insectoids are the real danger. Once they infect a brain, there’s no saving the host, and the eggs can infect everyone who comes into contact with the host. There was once a tourist planet where the people got infected, and now that planet is a wasteland.\"\n\"And the queen insectoids?\" Arix asked, trying to hide her fear.\n\"Queen insectoids aren’t strong fighters, but they lay a billion eggs at a time and like to crawl into living bodies to lay their eggs. The eggs hatch and burst out of the body only when the host’s nutrients are depleted, leaving nothing but skin.\" Drexel had seen videos left by victims and spared Arix the more gruesome details. The host remains alive until the eggs hatch, slowly being consumed from the inside.\nArix was speechless, finding the world terrifying. She wondered how she could return to the world she came from, working as a normal chemist.\nSeeing Arix with wide eyes and a shocked face, Drexel found her unexpectedly cute. He ruffled her hair and chuckled, \"Don’t worry. Until you graduate from the military academy, you won’t come into contact with the truly dangerous insectoids.\"\nArix pouted but didn’t explain. It wasn’t that she was afraid of insectoids; it’s just that humans naturally don’t like bugs. Especially something like queen insectoids and the parasitic ones.\nJust the thought of bugs crawling inside a body made Arix so disgusted she wished she could wipe out all the insectoids.\nOver the next three days, Arix and Drexel scoured the exam area for insectoid nests. They used potions to eliminate them until they destroyed the last nest.\nWith only three hours left until the exam ended, Arix was excited, \"With our points, we’re definitely in the top five. Not only is our tuition fully covered, but I heard the top ten get rewards. I wonder what they are. Can’t wait!\"\nDrexel, usually carefree, was now frowning deeply, which made Arix curious. \"What’s wrong? Is everything alright?\" She wasn’t naive; seeing Drexel’s serious look, she knew something was amiss.\nDrexel took a deep breath and said seriously, \"We might be in big trouble.\"\nArix pondered for a moment, then her pupils shrank in disbelief. \"The other military academies?!\"\n\"We haven’t seen anyone from the Hecaris Military Academy in these three days in the exam area. I don’t think we’re just unlucky, so there’s only one possibility left – there’s no one from the Hecaris Military Academy left in the exam,\" Drexel said coldly, looking around the woods.\n\"Hah-hah! Heir to the Kering family? No surprise you’re guessed so quickly. But you’re too late. The trash from the Hecaris Military Academy has been eliminated by us. Oops...\"\nAs the arrogant voice sounded, numerous students emerged from the depths of the woods.\nArix noticed the emblems on all the students’ uniforms: the crescent moon, the Golden Lion, the test tube, and the cherry blossom.\nThe dire wolf of the Hecaris Military Academy was conspicuously absent.\n\"How does it feel to be surrounded, Drexel? Even if you have Supergiant-Class psychic power, you’ll be eliminated just like them today,\" Elio, the heir of the Snorri Military Academy, said arrogantly.\nDrexel ignored the bratty Elio and turned his attention to Varden, the leader from the Ceres Military Academy. He raising an eyebrow and asked, \"Since when does the Ceres Military Academy start to steal points?\"\nThe Ceres Military Academy was known as the odd one out among the five military academies, mainly focusing on chemists. It was known for its scarce student intake, so their participation in the exam was usually just a formality. Yet, this year, they had unexpectedly joined forces with the other academies.\n\"I’m not interested in points,\" Varden replied coolly, then turned to Arix, \"Your potions are impressive. It’s a pity you’re not in the Ceres Military Academy.\"\n\"Varden, don’t think I wouldn’t dare to hit you just because we’re cousins. It’s too much to try and poach Arix right in front of me!\" Drexel glared at Varden,huffing.\nTrying to poach Arix right in front of him was even worse than stealing points.\nArix never thought she’d unintentionally become the center of attention, evolving from a nobody to the main focus.\nShe felt like prey under the watchful eyes of the other candidates, akin to a piece of meat surrounded by hungry wolves.\nFeeling a bit scared, Arix timidly hid behind Drexel and said to Varden, \"I really like the Hecaris Military Academy and have no plans to transfer.\"\nDrexel also shielded Arix, giving his cousin Varden a stern look.\nVarden adjusted his glasses with a smile that grew warmer, saying, \"That’s truly a shame.\"\n\"Come on! Are we fighting or not? The exam will soon be over; we don’t have time for this,\" Elio impatiently raised his lightsaber, worth 20 million. He had just bought it from the in-game store.\n\"What do you two think?\" Varden looked at Cirilla and Zephyr standing by his side.\n\"Let’s just fight and get it over with!\" Cirilla’s voice, sweet yet haughty, came from her youthful and beautiful face.\n\"Let’s make it quick,\" Zephyr said coldly.",

      "content": "Chapter 12: The Nest\nMeanwhile, the examiner and the live stream audience were watching the scene nervously.\n\"How can we fight against so many? Maybe we should just surrender,\" Arix felt hopeless. Even though this was just a holographic copy from the interstellarnet, the pain felt real, and she didn’t want to suffer for nothing.\nDrexel, coming from a military family, was used to the idea of never surrendering. He was actually speechless at Arix’s willingness to give up so easily.\n\"Top ten in the Alliance get a full scholarship, including free meals,\" Drexel said emotionlessly to Arix.\n\"But, we can’t possibly win,\" Arix’s voice wavered, but she still sadly refused.\n\"There are mechas for the top ten winners,\" Drexel couldn’t help but reveal. He had known how much Arix loved mechas, after spending a few days together.\nHearing this, Arix froze as if struck by a revelation.\nSeeing Arix silent, Drexel sighed, wondering if he was pushing her too hard. After all, Arix was more of a chemist, not much of a fighter.\n\"Arix, maybe we should just surrender. Even if we lose, our points might still get us into the Hecaris Military Academy,\" Drexel comforted.\nAt that, Arix moved. \"Surrender? You wouldn’t want to do that.\"\nArix turned, her eyes fiercely fixed on Drexel, her psychic power erupting with a terrifying pressure.\nDrexel didn’t realize the influence of mechas on Arix was so profound.\nFeeling a chill, Drexel swallowed and muttered, \"No, we won’t surrender.\"\n\"Good, then let’s get ready to fight,\" Arix said, satisfied, shifting her menacing gaze from Drexel to the other military academy candidates.\nEven as Arix shifted her gaze away, Drexel couldn’t relax. He could sense a terrifying psychic power moving around him, one that seemed no less potent than his own, perhaps even surpassing it.\nHis potential was already at the Supergiant-Class level, so this could only mean Arix’s power was beyond Supergiant-Class, which Drexel had only heard of in legends.\nThinking this, Drexel’s pupils shrank, and he couldn’t help but sneak a peek at the girl who had moved from behind him to stand in front.\n’Who is she, really? Just an orphan from Planet Waste?’\n\"I heard Drexel had Supergiant-Class psychic power! The mental pressure is intense, indeed,\" Elio, the overly dramatic teenager, mistook the psychic power for Drexel’s. Despite feeling a bit scared, he shouted arrogantly.\nThe other three from the military academies were misled by Elio, turning their attention to Drexel.\nDrexel felt like he was unfairly blamed and shot Elio a look that said, \"Really?\" The future seemed worrying with someone like Elio as the heir of his family.\n\"This just got interesting,\" Cirilla said, her interest piqued. She infused her psychic power into her hidden weapons, eagerly aiming them at Drexel.\n\"Cousin, don’t go crying if you lose,\" Varden said with a gentle smile, as if he were just a friendly guy next door. He then took out a harp from the in-game store and started playing, the notes turning into psychic power waves slicing towards Drexel.\n\"Drexel! Today, you’ll definitely lose to me,\" Elio roared excitedly, infusing his psychic power into his sword and chopping down towards Drexel like a crashing mountain.\nZephyr, the emotionless one, took out an energy gun from the in-game store and aimed silently at Drexel, looking every bit the cold-blooded assassin.\n\"You’re having a tough time, huh? So many people wanting to beat you up,\" Arix teased from behind Drexel.\nDrexel quickly formed a psychic barrier, struggling to fend off the mental assaults from all sides. Hearing Arix’s comment nearly made him spit out blood in frustration.\n\"Aren’t you going to help?\" Drexel’s handsome face twisted, and he glared at Arix through gritted teeth.\n\"Why should I? With so many of them... I’m not stupid,\" Arix blinked her big eyes, pretending to be innocent.\nThat was the last straw for Drexel, who couldn’t hold back any longer and literally spewed out blood in anger.\n\"Whoa!\" Arix was startled, her conscience finally kicking in. She stopped teasing Drexel, hoisted him up on her back, and picked a less crowded direction to escape.\nUsing her psychic power clumsily, she sent the blocking students flying and quickly made her getaway.\nThe four team leaders left behind were dumbfounded by this unexpected turn of events, and the scene fell silent for a while.\n\"Is that skinny one a Supergiant?\" Elio, usually fearless, felt his heart skip a beat for the first time.\n\"Clearly. And if I’m not mistaken, that psychic pressure we felt earlier was also from her,\" Varden said, his expression turning serious.\nAmong the top five families of the Alliance, besides Drexel Kering who was born with Supergiant-Class psychic power, the heirs of the other four families achieved their Supergiant-Class status through immense resources. Now, the appearance of a wild Supergiant in the new student exam might stir things up at the five military academies for a while.\n\"Hmph, I don’t care if it’s Supergiant-Class or not. If you guys are too scared to fight, I will,\" Cirilla said, undeterred by the notion of Supergiant-Class psychic power. As long as there were points to be earned, she would even dare to confront an insectoid queen.\nZephyr, unimpressed by the revelation of Arix being Supergiant-Class, coldly noted to his three companions, \"They’ve gotten far away.\"\nThe other three swallowed hard and yelled, \"Let’s chase!\"\nAt the Alliance military academy meeting room, Marlone shrank his neck a bit nervously, glancing at the other four examiners. He met their stern gazes, feeling increasingly uneasy.\n\"Glaring at me won’t change anything. Arix is now a student at the Hecaris Military Academy, and she’s expressed her liking for our academy,\" he said, trying to assert some confidence.\n\"You’re mistaken about one thing. Arix was admitted to the Koros Military Academy. There was just a small mishap that led her to the Hecaris. After the competition, we’ll clarify things with Arix, so she remains a student of the Koros Military Academy,\" Solis said, forcing a smile, but his eyes were fixed on Marlone.\n\"Ridiculous! Arix is clearly our student at the Hecaris Military Academy. Since when did she become yours?\" Marlone retorted, his anger flaring up as he stared back at Solis.\n\"She was admitted by the Koros, how can you deny that? And who’s to say there wasn’t some collusion on your part to have her end up at your academy?\" Solis was determined to win Arix back for the Koros Military Academy, putting his reputation on the line.\nMarlone argued more assertively, his tone becoming colder, \"If only Koros Military Academy had protected their students’ legitimate rights properly! Tell me, how did Arix end up with us? Without the Hecaris Military Academy, the Alliance would have lost a Supergiant-Class talent. You should already feel lucky that the Alliance isn’t accusing you of negligence!\"\n\"Hey, watch your words!\" Solis was at a loss for words, fuming with anger.\n\"Alright, alright. Whichever military academy Arix chooses, she remains a member of the Alliance. What’s there to fight about?\" Mendez intervened, trying to ease the tension.\nLaiden couldn’t help but burst into laughter, apologizing as he tried to contain himself, \"Sorry, I couldn’t help it. Please, continue.\"\nMendez gave Laiden a stern look and continued, \"The issue of Arix’s stolen enrollment will surely be taken to a military court. I’m sure the judge will provide a satisfactory solution to all parties involved.\"\nMarlone and Solis calmed down a bit, exchanging cold glances before turning away, each still simmering with frustration.\nLaiden, realizing the excitement had died down, showed a hint of disappointment. But then, as if struck by a sudden thought, his spirits lifted.\nRaising his eyebrows at the other examiners, he posed a provocative question, \"A natural Supergiant-Class psychic power user, possibly even beyond that. Do you really think such a talent could emerge from Planet Waste?\"\nThe mood in the room shifted as the question sunk in, prompting a flurry of activity. Messages began to stream from the opticomputers of the examiners, each tapping into their networks and resources.\nWith a satisfied grin for having stirred the pot, Laiden leisurely composed a message to his own family, eager to share the intriguing developments.",

      "content": "Chapter 13: Exam Over\nIn the exam site right now, Elio was grumbling away, but still not giving up, searching all around. \"Where the heck could they be hiding? Even a cat isn’t as good at hiding as they are.\"\nVarden, who always got a kick out of seeing Elio bump into Drexel, was just chilling. He was leaning against a tree, tuning his harp’s strings.\nAfter a bit, Zephyr came out from the trees to the south. He shook his head at the two, and then just leaned against a tree, cleaning his energy gun.\nElio was frustrated but not daring to express it at the lack of help from the others. He could only hope as he looked towards Cirilla, who hadn’t come back from the east yet.\n\"I didn’t find them either,\" Cirilla said as she came out from the eastern woods, dodging dirty, dusty leaves with a look of disgust.\nElio’s hopeful look fell, and he cursed through gritted teeth, \"Drexel! Come out, what’s the point of hiding? Be a man, come out and fight!\"\nAfter cursing, he swung his sword at the nearby woods in frustration. Where the light blade passed, trees fell down one after another.\nArix was hiding in a hole. When she poked her head out and saw this terrifying scene, she quickly pulled back. Then she swallowed nervously and whispered to Drexel, \"Are your enemies always this scary?\"\nDrexel coolly said to Arix, \"Now they’re your enemies too.\"\nHearing the annoyance in Drexel’s tone, Arix felt a bit guilty, \"I didn’t mean to do it just now, sorry, okay? I won’t tease you again, alright?\"\nDrexel’s expression softened a bit, but he still glared fiercely at Arix, \"If there’s a next time, I won’t need them to act; I’ll take you out myself.\"\n\"I didn’t expect you to be so naive! Lucky it’s me, if it were someone else, you would have been sold out without a clue,\" Arix mumbled under her breath.\n\"What are you mumbling about?\" Drexel looked at Arix suspiciously, feeling like she was bad-mouthing him again.\nArix stiffened for a moment, dodged the gaze, and then calmly said, \"Nothing, I wasn’t mumbling. I was just thinking this place isn’t safe. If their main force comes, we definitely can’t hide.\"\n\"You’re right, they would go through everything, even an ant’s nest. This place isn’t safe,\" Drexel frowned and thought.\nSeeing that she had fooled Drexel, Arix breathed a sigh of relief.\n\"Wait! I’ve got an idea,\" Drexel said with a smile, seeming a bit excited.\nArix looked at Drexel eagerly, \"What’s the idea, come on, tell me.\"\nDrexel smirked at Arix, then mysteriously said, \"Do you remember the insectoid nest?\"\nArix’s face turned green, and the corner of her mouth twitched. \"You’re not thinking of hiding in an insectoid nest, are you?\"\n\"Bingo!\" Drexel nodded in approval.\n\"Don’t even think about it. If you want to go, go by yourself. I’d rather be eliminated than go to a place where bugs live,\" Arix declared, holding onto her dignity as if it were her last stand.\n\"Don’t you want your mecha anymore?\" Drexel said coolly.\nArix stiffened, then put on a weepy face. \"Drexel, you’ve changed so much, you know that? You’re no longer the kind and warm dude you used to be 30 minutes ago.\"\nDrexel rolled his eyes and shuddered in disgust, \"Cut the act. Let’s head to the insectoid nest before the main force of our enemies arrives.\"\nArix stopped struggling and sulkily followed Drexel out of the hole.\nHalf an hour later, when they finally reached the entrance of the nest, the terrifying and disgusting surroundings made Arix wish she could die on the spot.\nThe inside of the insectoid nest was smelly and damp. The sticky ground was covered in insectoid corpses, and there were even piles of insectoid waste in the corners.\nNot only did Arix turn pale, but even Drexel felt queasy. However, his fragile pride wouldn’t allow him to admit it.\nAfter a moment, Arix and Drexel exchanged a look and turned to head back, only to be greeted by four sinister smiling faces.\n\"Darn it! Told you there’s monster inside!\" Arix shrieked and darted behind Drexel.\nDrexel, unimpressed, elbowed Arix, \"It’s not a monster.\"\nArix let out a sigh of relief and cautiously peeked out from behind Drexel. \"How did you find us so quickly? You didn’t cheat, did you?\"\n\"Ha! You think I need to cheat? To catch you guys, I spent an entire term’s allowance to buy a tracking device from the store. If I don’t eliminate you today, I won’t be doing justice to my one hundred million astrocredits,\" Elio said, his smile twisting.\nOne hundred million!\nArix and Drexel were both stunned. The original Arix sold her enrollment for 1 million and died. Now the new Arix was offered 100 times more than that.\nThinking this, Arix looked at Elio, the stupid rich dude, with a broken heart. If he had given the money to her directly, Arix knew she would concede defeat without a second thought.\nDrexel, with a subtle expression, said, \"How about you give me the money and I’ll concede defeat right here right now?\"\n\"Exactly, Elio. I don’t need that much; just 50 million is enough for me. If that’s too much, I’ll take 10 million,\" Arix said, her eyes filled with hope.\n\"In your dreams!\" Elio gritted his teeth, each word seething with anger.\nWithout another word, Elio raised his sword and charged at Arix and Drexel.\n\"Run!\"\nArix and Drexel didn’t hesitate; they turned around and dashed into the insectoid nest.\nElio immediately gave chase but was quickly repulsed by the disgusting smell emanating from the insectoid nest.\n\"What’s that smell?\" Elio grimaced, almost blacking out from disgust.\nCirilla’s face turned shades of blue. After pondering for a moment, she decided to stay back with Varden and Zephyr, about ten meters away from the entrance of the nest.\n\"Aren’t you going to chase them?\" Elio turned and asked the other three.\n\"Drexel is my cousin, after all. How could I do that to my cousin?\" Varden said innocently.\n’Now you remember he’s your cousin!’\nElio thought sarcastically, then turned to Cirilla.\n\"How could I possibly go into such a disgusting place?\" Cirilla said with a grimace.\nElio rolled his eyes internally at this princess and then looked at Zephyr.\n\"Ugh! How disgusting!\" Zephyr simply stated, with a cold expression.\nResigned to his fate with such teammates, Elio was about to grit his teeth and head into the insectoid nest when he saw the two who had just gone in running out like mad.\n\"Help!\" Arix screamed in terror, running for her life.\nElio, not noticing Arix’s fear, was initially excited to see Drexel running back towards them. But the next second, his excitement turned to horror, and he took off like he was being chased by a ghost.\nVarden and the others finally realized something was wrong. On closer inspection, they saw a seemingly endless swarm of giant insectoids following closely behind Arix and Drexel.\nThe group exchanged nervous glances, swallowed hard, and then sprinted after Elio.\n\"Wait for us!\" Arix shouted, desperately trying to keep up.\n\"What’s going on? Why are there so many bugs? Didn’t you guys kill them all?\" Elio asked as he ran.\nArix was too distressed to speak, and Drexel, with a complicated expression, said, \"There’s a Queen inside.\"\nSilence fell upon hearing this.\n\"Why is she waking up? What the hell did you do?\" Elio exclaimed in desperation.\nBack at the Alliance Military Academy’s meeting room, Laiden was watching the video feed with a deadpan look, his eyes fixed on Elio. The young man was still complaining.\nMarlone couldn’t hold back a chuckle, which he quickly tried to cover up with a cough, but it was too late.\nEven Solis and the others couldn’t help but smile at the scene.\nLaiden shot Marlone a cold glance before turning his attention back to the arena, saying with a sinister smile, \"One queen insect seems too few. Let’s add another one!\"\nMarlone opened his mouth as if to say something but thought better of it. Instead, he just looked sympathetically at the video feed, where the six were still frantically running for their lives.\nArix felt so tired, it was like her body was running while her soul floated behind, ready to leave her body at any moment.\n\"Oh man, oh man! I can’t keep this up!\"\nArix felt like giving up. If she couldn’t get the mecha she wanted now, there would always be another chance. If she kept running, she worried there wouldn’t be a \"later\" for her.\nDrexel also felt that running further wouldn’t solve anything, so he turned to Arix and asked, \"Do you have any bug-repelling potion?\"\n\"I have the ingredients! But they won’t work unless I made them into a potion.\" Arix knew what Drexel was planning, but they were surrounded by insectoids, making it impossible to make the potion right now.\n\"How long will it take to make one?\" Drexel asked urgently.\n\"Twenty minutes,\" Arix replied, gritting her teeth.\nIt normally took half an hour, but under the current circumstances, she could make it in twenty minutes if she tried her hardest.\n\"Start making the potion, leave the rest to me,\" Drexel told Arix and then ran off to join the other four.\nSoon, Drexel, with Elio and three others, surrounded Arix, leaving her puzzled.\n\"Arix, the five of us will hold up a psychic barrier, but we only have 20 minutes, so everything is up to you,\" Drexel said seriously.\nArix, stunned, looked into Drexel’s solemn eyes. He had been immature and even a bit foolish not long ago, but now he seemed reliable.\n\"I got it!\" Arix replied, her gaze serious.\nDrexel, Cirilla, Elio, Zephyr, and Varden stopped running and formed a circle around Arix, protecting her.\nTogether, their incredible psychic powers merged into a psychic barrier, a feat not as simple as it sounded. The powers had to be equal, and they had to trust each other completely. Any doubt could cause severe backlash.\nThis show of brotherhood was almost too much for Arix.\nAs the psychic barrier formed, countless insectoids swarmed over, crashing against the barrier.\n\"Arix, hurry!\" Drexel, the only one among them who was seriously injured, kept channeling his psychic power into the barrier, using all his strength even to speak.\nArix suppressed her worry. She took a deep breath, and quickly took out her alchemy equipment from the buy-to-win shop.\nShe crushed the ingredients, heated them, simmered the mixture, extracted, and purified it...\nDuring the wait, Elio noticed something off with Drexel’s psychic power. It should have been stable and peaceful, but it was now fluctuating like ocean waves, which was a sign that his psychic power was nearing exhaustion.\n\"Drexel...\" Elio’s words were cut short by the sight of Drexel’s face. He was shockingly pale, with blood streaming from his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears, making him look less than alive.\nDespite that, Drexel managed a weak shake of his head at Elio.\nElio was utterly confused.\n’Why would Drexel not pull out of the exam under such conditions? Continuing like this could damage his psychic world; and even if he made it through, it would require at least a month in a healing pod. Drexel was not one to focus solely on immediate gains, so what was he holding on for?’\nWhen Elio was about to ask, Drexel shook his head again, his eyes pleading in a manner Elio had never seen before.\nElio fell silent, taken aback by Drexel’s plea. He should have felt happy, but instead, he was filled with anger and turned away from Drexel.\nDrexel sighed in relief, not quite sure himself why he persisted, but he knew he wanted Arix to win a top ten mecha, to give this interesting little girl what she desired.\nFrom the moment he met Arix, Drexel was reminded of his sister Raya, who was kidnapped by traitors of the Kering family ten years ago and never found.\nRaya was mischievous, wearing red dresses but climbing mechas like a boy, causing their mother to nearly faint while she laughed heartily.\nDespite the relentless insectoid assault on the psychic barrier, Drexel’s bloodied face bore a smile from the beautiful memories.\nOne minute, five minutes, ten, fifteen... In the final half minute of the 20-minute mark, Arix successfully crafted the bug-repellent spray.\nWithout a word, she sprayed everyone with it. The potion worked wonders, and the insectoids, as if facing their nemesis, flew away from the psychic barrier.\nIn less than a minute, the swarming insectoids were gone. The group collapsed on the ground, exhausted, not caring about the dirt, not even Cirilla.\n\"Huh? Drexel, aren’t you tired?\" Cirilla asked, admiringly looking at Drexel, who was still standing.\nHearing this, Arix and Elio’s faces changed, and they rushed towards Drexel in panic.\nVarden, realizing something was wrong with his cousin, quickly stood up to join them.\nZephyr and Cirilla exchanged a worried glance and followed.\nIn a frantic panic, Arix caught Drexel as he fell.\nHis face was covered in blood, prompting her to call out in a fluster.\nVarden, also worried, looked over Drexel. Luckily, as an heir to a chemist family and skilled in medicine, he managed to give Drexel a basic check-up.\nAfter making sure Drexel was fine, Varden fumed, \"Drexel, you’re really pushing it! Your psychic power’s worn out. You need to give up now, leave the exam, and don’t even think about leaving a healing pod for at least a month,\"\nVarden could no longer maintain his usual calm demeanor.\n\"Sorry, Varden,\" Drexel managed weakly, even as he coughed up blood.\nThen, turning slightly to Elio, he said, \"Didn’t you want to eliminate me? Here’s your chance, will you take it?\"\nElio looked disdainfully at Drexel, lifting his chin haughtily, \"You’re no longer worthy of being my rival. Beating someone as stupid as you would only disgrace myself.\"\nDrexel couldn’t help laughing, which caused him to cough up more blood.\n\"Drexel, can you hold on? The exam is almost over,\" Arix said, her eyes reddening.\n\"Sorry, I can’t stay till the end with you. I’ll wait for you outside. Good luck.\" With a smile, Drexel’s body digitized and vanished from the holographic exam area.\nArix clenched her fists in silence for a long time before finally looking up at the others and saying, \"Shall we take down the insectoid queen?\"\nVarden and the others exchanged looks and silently nodded in agreement.\nAs the entrance exam neared its end, Arix, still venting her frustration on the insectoids, felt a tug at her soul.\nThen she woke up in the giant Connective Pod.\n\"Jeez, that scared the life out of me.\" As soon as Arix opened her eyes, she saw a crowd of students surrounding her, nearly giving her a heart attack.\nThe students fell silent, staring at Arix as if she were an alien.\n\"You got Supergiant-Class psychic power?\" one of the students suddenly asked.\nArix, confused, wasn’t sure about her psychic power level but felt the term \"Supergiant-Class\" might refer to her, so she incredulously asked, \"Are you talking about me?\"\n\"Yes, you. Don’t you know your own psychic power level?\" Once one person spoke up, the others began to join in.\nArix swallowed her words. The old Arix had only tested her psychic power level once; she hadn’t done that since because the test was too expensive, a perfect excuse for not knowing her current level.\nThinking about this, Arix acted as if she was hesitant and embarrassed. Then she said, \"I don’t know... I’m sorry. The cost to such a test is 1,000 astrocredits, and that’s umm, so...\"\n\"So?\" All the students looked at Arix eagerly, waiting for her answer.\n\"So, I CAN’T AFFORD IT!\" Arix stressed innocently.\nIt might have been her imagination, but Arix felt as if there was a collective groan around her, as if her words had somehow caused a group of people to hurt emotionally.\nFeeling somewhat guilty but relieved, Arix was glad the subject had to change when the central screen in the examination area lit up.\nThe large screen displayed the message that the examination was over, followed by the campus announcement over the loudspeakers.\n\"The entrance examination competition for new students at the Hecaris Military Academy has officially ended. The results will be sent to the students’ opticomputers at 15:00 tomorrow. Please pay attention to the relevant information.\"\nAs the announcement ended, the holographic screen above the examination area disappeared from the center downwards, exposing all the students under the clear blue sky.\nOnce the holographic screen was completely gone, the students stopped crowding around Arix and started to leave the examination area one by one, some excited, others sad...\nAfter enduring three grueling days of the examination, Arix stretched comfortably at the sight of the clear blue sky. It was then that she suddenly felt like she had forgotten something important.",

      "content": "Chapter 14: New Family?\nSuddenly, Arix froze, quickly turning her head to look around.\nOnly when she turned back did she notice someone staring at her with a look of resentment.\n\"Wow, you remember me? I thought you’d forgotten all about me,\" Drexel said with a raised eyebrow, his face pale.\nNow, Drexel didn’t look as pitiful as in the holographic exam room, but his slightly pale face showed that he wasn’t feeling well.\nArix, feeling a bit guilty, supported Drexel. She rolled her eyes at him and said, \"Seriously, you? Your psychic power is draining, and you’re not in a hurry to get it treated?\"\n\"If I had gone back earlier, you think you’d have the chance to stick to the end?\" Drexel, with a mischievous smile, continued, \"Now, outside the school, there are media from all big platforms and people from the five noble families, even Empire spies, all waiting for you.\"\nArix looked at Drexel skeptically, feeling she was being tricked again. \"You are not scaring me, are you?\"\n\"Just go to see for yourself,\" Drexel smiled cunningly.\nArix didn’t intend to risk it, so she turned her gaze to Drexel, \"Just tell me, what’s your plan? Waiting for me with such serious injuries? I don’t believe you just want to chat.\"\n\"Stay at my place till school starts next month,\" Drexel finally said somewhat seriously.\nArix was shocked; she thought she would be satisfied if Drexel just took her to a safe place, but Drexel... could he be this nice?\n\"Don’t hesitate, let’s go!\" Seeing Arix embarrassed and hesitating, Drexel grabbed her wrist and took her to the military academy’s private levitation car parking lot.\nSeeing the Kering family’s Lev car, Arix focused all her attention on it. She touched here and there like a curious child, even staying in the cockpit, unwilling to leave.\nDrexel felt awkward by Arix’s foolish behavior, facepalming. He couldn’t understand how Arix, who seemed a chemistry genius, could prefer machines like a homebody.\nFinally, upon arrival home, Drexel quickly dragged Arix out. She was still trying to cling to the Lev, off amidst the Kering family servants’ giggles.\n\"Your ’house’ looks quite nice,\" Arix remarked, following Drexel in amazement since entering.\nThe size of the mansion was hard to guess, with lush rose bushes on both sides of the road.\nNot far was a small fountain, and even the ground tiles were delicately patterned.\nDrexel said with pride, \"It has to look nice. It is the residence of an Alliance’s admiral. If it didn’t, wouldn’t it disgrace the Alliance? And these flowers and grass, my mother took care of them herself.\"\n\"Cut it out. Look at your face. You’re too proud as if you were the one taking care of them,\" Arix rolled her eyes.\n\"I dug these flower holes, so that counts as me taking care of them,\" Drexel argued playfully.\nAs they joked and laughed at each other, they reached the front door of the grand hall.\nThe moment they pushed the door open, however, Arix’s smile instantly turned cold. Her eyes were fixed on a girl standing behind a distinguished lady in the living room.\nThe girl, upon seeing Arix, had a hint of nervousness and even panic in her eyes, as if she had seen someone long dead suddenly appear before her.\nDrexel curiously looked at the girl in a white dress standing behind his mother. \"Eh, Dad, Mom, and Kellan, how come you’re all at home today? And who is this young lady? I don’t think I’ve ever seen her before?\"\n\"Drexel, this must be your friend from school. Come, take a seat, make yourself at home,\" Fleur Kering, Drexel’s mother, said to Arix with a gentle smile.\nKellan was Drexel’s big brother. He just smiled and nodded to Arix.\n\"Thank you, ma’am,\" Arix said as she sat down, giving Fleur and Kellan a forced smile.\nDrexel also sat down and asked Fleur, \"Mother, you haven’t answered my question.\"\nDrexel was really curious because he knew Fleur well. She wouldn’t let someone stand beside her unless she genuinely liked them. But he had never seen this girl before, so how could his mother allow a stranger to stand by her side? He wondered.\n\"Drexel, this is your sister Raya; she’s been missing for ten years,\" Fleur said affectionately, holding the hand of the girl in the white dress as she introduced her to Drexel.\nDrexel was initially surprised, but the more he looked at this ’sister’ popping out of nowhere, the more uncomfortable he felt. Even a voice inside him was telling him that this person could not possibly be his sister.\n\"Drexel, it’s me,\" Raya called out in a soft and sweet voice.\nDrexel felt a wave of disgust rising from the bottom of his heart, and his mind inexplicably started to get irritated. This feeling was too strange.\nDrexel barely nodded to Raya and then asked Fleur, \"Have you done a genetic test?\"\n\"Yes, Raya went to participate in the Koros Military Academy entrance exam, got injured during the competition, and was taken to the hospital. Fortunately, the hospital discovered that Raya’s blood type matched our family’s gene bank. Otherwise, who knows how much longer it would have taken to find your sister,\" Fleur said, becoming choked up with emotion as she spoke.\nSeeing Fleur cry, Drexel panicked and, suppressing the odd feeling inside him, comforted her, \"Don’t cry, Mom. She’s back now and she looks nice.\"\nArix watched all this with an indifferent face.\nHer mind, however, was in turmoil, because never had she expected to encounter the murderer who had killed the Old Arix today.\nAnd this murderer turned out to be the granddaughter of the Alliance’s admiral, Raya Kering?\nRemembering everything that the Old Arix went through, Arix could no longer remain calm while watching this family reunion. She owed it to the Old Arix to seek justice.\nShe probably wouldn’t visit the Kering family again, not wanting to stay another moment.\nSo, Arix said to Drexel, \"Drexel, I’m sorry, I have an emergency and must leave now.\"\nDrexel, seeing Arix about to leave without a word, suddenly became anxious. \"Arix, didn’t you say you’d stay at my place until school starts? Why are you leaving?\"\n\"Sorry, Drexel, I really have something urgent to attend to,\" Arix explained, barely holding back her anger. She didn’t wait any longer and stood up, heading straight for the door.\n\"Drexel, what’s wrong with your friend? She seems unhappy,\" Thaddeus asked.\n\"I’m not sure what’s going on. She was fine just a moment ago,\" Drexel was equally puzzled.\n\"Maybe she really has something urgent to do.\" Raya pretended to be understanding, but there was a dark gleam in her eyes. Seeing Arix leave, she actually felt a sigh of relief inside. She couldn’t understand how Arix, even after being given a potion meant to destroy her psyche, was still alive.\n’Huh, but now I am the granddaughter of the Alliance’s admiral. A mere orphan from Planet Waste should know to stay far away if she knows what’s good,’\nRaya thought, growing more pleased with herself by the moment, yet her exterior was all innocence and purity.\n\"You have no idea how dangerous it is for Arix to be out there alone right now,\" Drexel couldn’t help but snap at Raya.\n\"Drexel! How dare you speak to your sister like that?\" Fleur scolded with a cold face.\nDrexel swallowed his anger, realizing his outburst was somewhat irrational, and said, \"Sorry, I need to step out for a moment.\" With that, he hurried after Arix.\n\"This child, Drexel, is so grown up yet still so thoughtless,\" Fleur murmured.\n\"Mom, if I’m not mistaken, the classmate Drexel brought home is the student with the Supergiant-Class psychic power that just emerged in the Alliance,\" Shen Kaiyu speculated thoughtfully.\n\"Oh, it’s her. Then it’s really not good to let her be outside alone. With so many eyes on her now, who knows if she’ll be in danger?\" Fleur began to worry.\n\"Don’t worry, we should trust Drexel. He’ll handle it,\" Thaddeus comforted Fleur, wrapping his arm around her shoulder.\nRaya, standing behind Fleur, had looked uneasy since she learned Arix possessed a 3s psychic power, finally understanding why Arix was still alive. The psychic power destroying potion could only destroy psychic powers up to Star-Class, and it seemed Arix had narrowly escaped its effects.",

      "content": "Chapter 15: Attacked\nDrexel was chasing and anxiously asked, \"Arix, wait up, what’s going on? Didn’t we agree you’d stay at my place for a month?\"\nJust as Arix was about to step out of the Kering family’s gate, she couldn’t bear to leave and stopped. Turning around to face Drexel, she calmly said, \"Drexel, you go back. I won’t be staying at this place.\"\n\"Why?\" Drexel was truly puzzled. Everything seemed fine before, but it all changed after Arix saw Raya. Arix turned into a spiky hedgehog all of a sudden.\n\"Is it because of Raya? You’ve been acting weird since you met her.\" Drexel wasn’t sure, but then cautiously added, \"Have you met her before? Did you hate her or something?\"\nArix felt a twinge in her nose from Drexel’s blind support, almost spilling all the truth. But the evidence she had was not enough to confront an admiral’s granddaughter. So speaking out now might only hurt herself. Besides, that girl was Drexel’s sister.\nSeeing Arix didn’t want to talk, Drexel considerately stopped pressing. \"I have an apartment near the school. I’ve sent the address and the digital key to your opticomputer. It’s very safe there. Stay there for now, here, take it, and don’t refuse me again.\"\nArix wanted to refuse at first. Seeing Drexel’s worried face, however, Arix softened and said, \"Alright, you better go back and get treated. Your psychic power’s drained.\"\nSeeing Arix accept his help, Drexel finally relaxed and said, \"Wait for me, Arix. I’ll come to you once I’m healed.\"\n\"Okay.\" Arix couldn’t help but smile. She said goodbye to Drexel and left the Kering family’s door.\nAfter Arix left, Drexel’s expression turned grave. Now he wondered what Raya had done to Arix.\nThis series of reactions from Arix didn’t seem like petty squabbles between teenagers, but more like a deep grudge between them.\nNaturally, Drexel trusted Arix more. Arix had fought alongside him in the past few days, while this \"sister\" had just popped out of nowhere, and Drexel found her character questionable.\nWhen Drexel returned to the living room, he didn’t see Raya. So he curiously looked at Fleur.\n\"She’s gone for a nap,\" said Fleur, her tone cold. The affection Fleur showed Raya in public was gone, replaced by disdain.\nDrexel was confused.\nFleur, who seemed so caring a moment ago, had now reverted to her usual aloof self.\n\"Drexel, honey, let’s talk in the study,\" Thaddeus sighed.\nOnce everyone was in the study, Thaddeus unleashed his Supergiant-Class psychic power, enveloping the room to prevent eavesdropping.\n\"Mom, Dad, what’s going on? Is she really my sister?\" Drexel went straight to the point.\n\"Just a fake,\" Fleur scoffed coldly. \"How could we possibly mistake our own daughter?\"\n\"Then why keep a fake around?\" Drexel was confused, unable to grasp why his parents would tolerate an impostor in their home.\n\"Even though she’s a fake, she had somehow got Raya’s genes. If we want to uncover the mastermind behind this, we have to take this bait, and we have to do it willingly,\" Thaddeus explained tiredly. His temples seemed to have sprouted more white hairs at the moment.\nKellan tried to comfort the two and said, \"Don’t be upset, Mom, Dad. At least we have some news about Raya. I think our family reunion isn’t far off.\"\n\"I think we should look into Arix, too. I think there’s bad blood between her and this fake,\" Drexel suddenly said.\n\"I know about this. The matter has already caused a stir in the military. The fake took Arix’s place to attend the entrance exam at the Koros Military Academy. The process of this substitution was somewhat disgraceful,\" Kellan said, careful not to upset Drexel too much.\nJust hearing this was enough to infuriate Drexel. He clenched his teeth, ready to confront the impostor and avenge Arix.\nFleur shot a cold and warning glance to Drexel and said, \"What are you planning to do? This should be a long haul, and we don’t want to act harsh and alert the people behind the fake. You want to find the real Raya? Then just calm down the do as we say.\"\nAlthough Drexel’s eyes were bloodshot with anger, he eventually slumped back into his chair when he heard what Fleur said.\nThaddeus told him, \"Drexel, she can’t escape. Just keep it down for now. Once we find your sister, I promise you she’ll pay for everything she had done.\"\n\"I understand,\" Drexel said hoarsely.\nMeanwhile, Arix, had just left the Kering family. She wasn’t in the mood to wander around aimlessly. She hailed a Lev with her opticomputer, and took the ride to Drexel’s apartment.\nAs soon as she entered the address into the car’s control panel, a gentle female voice sounded in the car:\n\"Thank you for choosing GalaTech’s service. Please fasten your seatbelt. The Lev will start in 10 seconds. I wish you a pleasant ride.\"\nAs the Lev started, Arix rested her head and admired the bustling city outside.\nUnlike the concrete and steel of modern cities, the Alliance’s cities carried a hint of sci-tech flair.\nShops of various sizes lined the streets, selling mechas, potions, and even Psychic Ware, while many private Levs and spaceships flew in the sky.\nArix saw a speeding Lev pulled over by a police drone and issued a ticket.\nLaughing at the thought that there were still tickets in this era, Arix turned her attention back inside the car to study the Lev’s features.\nRemembering how she had used her psychic power to \"see\" the internal structure of a mecha, Arix became intrigued when she looked at the Lev she was in.\nShe adjusted her seat and let her psychic power act like eyes, delving into the Lev’s insides. Soon, a complete image of the car’s structure formed in her mind.\n\"What’s this?\" Arix mumbled, puzzled as she looked towards the bottom of the car.\nThere, her psychic power detected something resembling a small package, and her psychic power was even blocked from probing inside it.\nJust then, another Lev of the same model passed by. Arix quickly used her psychic power to scan its underside and was surprised to find it completely smooth with nothing attached.\nArix’s heart raced. A strong sense of danger prompted her. She kicked the car door open violently and jumped out to a spot where she could cushion her fall.\nThe moment Arix landed, a loud explosion sounded above. Had she been a moment later, the outcome would have been disastrous.\n\"Help, there’s a bomb!\"\n\"Where are the patrol robots? Call the police!\"\n\"Is Hecaris under a terrorist attack?\"\nCaught in the midst of the panicking crowd, Arix had no time to think further as parts of the destroyed car were rapidly falling from the sky.\nMany pedestrians on the ground hadn’t managed to escape yet.\nIn her anxiety, Arix unleashed all her psychic power from her psychic world, wrapping it around the pedestrians who couldn’t escape in time. She lifted them and tossed them into the buildings on either side of the street.\nAfter the danger had passed and Arix had caught her breath, she felt a chill of fear. Had she not jumped without hesitation, she might have been dead by now.\nArix’s gaze turned coldly towards the direction of the Kering family. The old Arix and her current self hadn’t offended anyone in this city.\nThe only person who would be so eager for her demise was Raya.\n\"Woo-woo-woo. Woo-woo-woo!\"\nWithin five minutes of the incident, three police Levs stopped in front of Arix.\nSix officers got out of the vehicles and aimed their energy guns at her, shouting, \"Don’t move!\"\n\"Officer, I swear I had nothing to do with this,\" Arix said timidly, raising her hands. She died of gunshot in her last life, and now she couldn’t help trembling when she saw the threatening muzzles.\nSeeing Arix’s hands in the air, one of the officers softened his approach. He holstered his energy gun and showed his badge to Arix, saying, \"Young miss, you have the right to be silent. We need you to come with us to the station for an investigation. If you’re innocent, we definitely won’t wrong a good person.\"\n\"Okay, I understand,\" Arix complied.",

      "content": "Chapter 16: Meeting Cassian Thray\nAfter Arix was brought to the police station, she wasn’t interrogated right away. Instead, she was taken to a nearby hospital and was given a physical examination first.\nThe doctor who did the check-up took a tube of blood straight off the bat and ended up giving the waiting cops a report. The results showed that Arix was seriously undernourished.\nSeeing the slim little girl, who was all skin and bones, the doctors felt a rush of parental affection. They began offering Arix their snacks, and even during the questioning, they made a point to be extra gentle.\nBy the time it was confirmed that Arix was a victim and she was released from custody, it was almost midnight.\n\"Arix, thanks for helping so many people today. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to sleep tonight,\" the officer said, smiling and praising Arix as they left the police station.\n\"It’s what I should do, since the trouble started because of me,\" Arix replied with a shy smile, apologizing.\n\"It’s not your fault, kiddo. Why take all the blame? Anyway, just be safe on your way home and try not to go out much these days,\" the officer advised carefully.\nThinking about Arix’s background that he had read in the police files, he felt even more sympathetic and gently patted her on the head.\n\"Thank you, sir. I’ll be careful. Goodbye,\" Arix said politely before parting ways with the officer and heading out of the station.\nMeanwhile, at the back door of the hospital, a middle-aged man in a white lab coat walked out, carrying a small case.\nHe looked around cautiously before approaching a black Lev. Then he knocked softly on the window three times.\nThe next moment, a young man in a black suit opened the door and took the small case from the man.\n\"Is this Arix’s blood sample?\" asked the young man, looking rather unhappy.\n\"Yes, it’s hers,\" the doctor replied with a grim expression, unable to help but mutter, \"You’re from one of the five noble families, right? Gosh, you surely know how to put on these dramas. Bastards, stealing blood samples and all.\"\nThe young man coughed awkwardly and said earnestly, \"It’s for the future of the Alliance. The sooner we confirm which family Arix belongs to, the sooner she can get protected.\"\nRemembering the frail girl, the doctor fell silent for a moment and then sighed, \"I suppose that’s for the best.\"\nOn the street outside the police station, Arix checked the address of the apartment and realized it was only a ten-minute walk from the station.\nDeciding not to call a Lev, she set off to walk home. Late nights can sometimes make people feel their most vulnerable, and Arix, walking alone, suddenly felt a bit lonely. When she thought about never seeing her parents and friends from her previous life again, her mood started to drop even further.\nSuddenly, a faint animal cry broke the silence. \"Ow-oo....\"\nHearing the sound, Arix stopped in her tracks. She listened carefully for a moment before fixing her gaze on a trash can by the side of the road.\nWith a frown, Arix approached the trash can. After she lifted the lid, she saw a bloodied little puppy bathed in moonlight.\nThe puppy was in bad shape, breathing heavily as if he might breathe his last at any moment. His body was covered in wounds of all sizes, and his fur was soaked in blood.\n\"Gosh. What kind people would treat such an adorable puppy like that? Those jerks should really go to hell!\" Arix cursed angrily.\nThen, she quickly searched for a nearby pet hospital and hurriedly carried the puppy there.\nThe pet hospital was quite fancy.\nArix gave the puppy to the vet and waited in the holding area until it was almost dawn.\nThe vet, holding the still-sleepy puppy, handed it to Arix and advised, \"His external and internal injuries have healed. Now he just needs to be well-nourished.\"\n\"Okay, thank you, doctor,\" Arix said, somewhat surprised as she took the now-clean little dog from the doctor and went to pay the bills.\nThe sight of the nearly uncountable zeros almost made her blurt out some ’f’ words. But after carefully reviewing the bill and seeing the various surgeries performed on the puppy, including the most expensive cloned organ transplant, she resignedly paid.\nExhausted from the day’s turmoil and the financial hit, Arix carried the puppy and trudged back to her apartment in a daze.\nThe apartment was a simple and clean two-bedroom with a living room, kitchen, and bathroom.\nAfter she briefly checked the room, Arix placed the puppy by the bed. She took a quick shower in the bathroom, and then collapsed onto the bed.\nAs she petted the puppy’s head, she fell into a deep sleep.\nThe moment Arix fell asleep, the puppy opened his eyes, revealing golden irises.\nHe quietly watched Arix for a while before closing his eyes again.\nMeanwhile, thousands of miles away in the Empire, something beyond Arix’s wildest imagination was unfolding.\nIn a splendid palace, a handsome man adorned with a crown and royal attire sat on his throne, his gaze coldly sweeping over the ministers below.\nThe ministers, trembling under his stare, kept their heads bowed in a silence so profound that the drop of a sweat could be heard.\n\"Cassian has disappeared?\" Emperor Leonidas’s voice was devoid of any emotion, yet it sent shivers down the spines of the ministers below.\nDuke Gran was responsible for the incident leading to the prince’s disappearance. Now he had no choice but to step forward and explain, \"Everything was normal when Prince Cassian was battling the insectoids, but suddenly a wormhole appeared and swallowed His Highness. Despite the legion’s thorough search of the entire Aqualis Region, we’ve been unable to find any trace of His Highness. I am deeply sorry, Your Majesty.\"\n\"High Priest, is Cassian still alive?\" Emperor Leonidas, unfazed by Duke Gran’s report, turned his gaze to the high priest. The old man was standing next to Duke Gran, wearing a white robe.\nthe high priest, his hair and beard white with age, replied with a solemn and weathered voice. \"Your Majesty, according to the guidance of the Moon Goddess, Prince Cassian has been rescued by a noble soul and is currently out of danger. However, His Highness is not within the Empire’s territory, and his life may be threatened again.\"\nEmperor Leonidas’s perfect features remained impassive. His dark lashes cast a shadow as he pondered for a moment.\nHe then pointed indifferently at Duke Gran and said, \"If you can’t find him within three months, You will present yourself for sacrifice before the statue of the Moon Goddess.\"\n\"I am aware now, Your Majesty,\" Duke Gran breathed a sigh of relief.\nEven if he couldn’t find Prince Cassian in the end, sacrificing to the Moon Goddess would be an honor.",

      "content": "Chapter 17: Back Into The Hospital\nThe next day...\nAfter a good sleep, Arix lazily opened her eyes and took a deep, satisfying breath before remembering the little creature she had taken in the night before.\nShe quickly looked down and her gaze met a pair of golden eyes.\n\"Awwww!\" she exclaimed in surprise.\nDelighted, Arix picked up the little one.\n\"You’re so beautiful, little thing, and those golden eyes, they’re so unique!\" she observed, her eyes twinkling as she looked at the tiny puppy.\nThe little one was all white, about the size of a palm, resembling a miniature Samoyed with regal, golden eyes.\nThe puppy looked at Arix with a blank expression, his overly cute appearance creating a stark, charming contrast to his serious expression.\nArix got out of bed, opened the fridge, and took out some croissants that had been sealed for who knows how long.\nCurious, the little puppy cocked his head at the sight of the croissants.\n\"It’s not good to just call you ’little guy’ all the time. I’ll give you a name! You seem to like the croissants in my hand, so how about... Croissant?\" Arix said while petting Croissant’s head.\nAt the mention of his name, Cassian, surprised, looked up at Arix.\n\"Are you hungry? I’ll get up and make you a big meal now,\" Arix kissed Cassian on the forehead and left the room with a satisfied smile.\nCassian, the little wolf, sat stiffly on the soft bed, his adorable eyes incredulously following Arix as she left the room.\n’How can this young female kiss someone so casually? What should I do? Should I take responsibility?’\nCassian belonged to the werewolf clan of the Empire, and wolves are extremely loyal to their mates. Once they chose someone, they remained committed to that mate for life, even if they were to lose them.\nThough his father was Alpha Leonidas, Cassian was the only child.\nHowever, he thought that if he never returned to the Empire, his parents might have another child, as it was typical for their species to conceive again soon after losing an offspring.\nThe more Cassian thought, the more conflicted he felt. He pondered whether he should take responsibility towards Arix, and then he thought about whether he might get a younger brother once he returned to the Empire.\nUnaware of all this, Arix was using her opticomputer, ordering some fruits and vegetables from an app similar to a food delivery service.\nWithin less than ten minutes, a delivery robot arrived with the fresh groceries.\nArix spent half an hour in the kitchen making a salad for herself and frying a meat pie for Cassian. Looking at the nice-looking food on the table, Arix smiled with satisfaction.\n\"Croissant, it’s time to eat,\" Arix called out cheerfully. She went into the bedroom, picked up Cassian, and placed him beside the plate with the meat pie.\nCassian didn’t look at the meat pie right away. He gazed at Arix with a complex look and finally seemed to sigh in resignation.\n’Well, she did save me. How can I, a male, NOT be responsible?’\nWith that thought, Cassian relaxed his face. He gave a polite, gentle smile to his future mate.\nArix felt like her brain had paused for a moment. She almost screamed, covering her nose. She thought the Samoyed’s smile was already one of the warmest things in the world, but Cassian’s cuteness was on a whole new level.\nAfter smiling shyly, Cassian quickly looked down at the breakfast Arix had prepared for him. It was just a simple meat pie, but to Cassian, it seemed to glow with beauty.\nEagerly, Cassian took a bite. A strong taste of rawness and bitterness hit him instantly, overwhelming his senses.\nIf he didn’t know Arix was his lifesaver, Cassian would have been convinced this was an assassination attempt.\n\"Is it good?\" Arix asked, her eyes sparkling with expectation.\nCassian’s mouth twitched slightly, but he couldn’t bear to disappoint her. Finally, he closed his eyes tightly and devoured the meat pie as quickly as possible, not wanting it in his mouth a second longer.\n\"You like it that much! I’ll make it for you again next time!\" Arix said happily.\nAt her words, Cassian’s legs went weak, and he fainted right there.\nThe last thing he saw was Arix calling his name in panic.\nWhen Cassian woke up, he found himself on a small cushion, in a small room with a faint smell of disinfectant.\n’Where is this?’\nCassian struggled to look around and realized the place seemed familiar, as if he had just been there the day before.\nCassian whimpered softly, confused about his current situation.\nArix was at the vet’s, finding out about Cassian’s condition. Once she was assured there was nothing seriously wrong, she breathed a sigh of relief and headed back to the ward.\nJust as she returned to the ward, she found that Cassian was awake. Surprised and relieved, she exclaimed, \"Croissant, you’re finally awake.\"\nCassian looked up at Arix, noticing the deep dark circles under her eyes. He could tell without guessing that she probably hadn’t slept all night.\nThe more Cassian thought, the more his heart ached for her. He struggled to his feet and licked Arix’s hand, whining comfortingly as if to say, \"Don’t worry, I’m fine.\"\n\"Thank you, Croissant.\" Arix looked at Cassian’s sweet expression, and all her fatigue seemed to vanish. She was moved and gently kissed Cassian on the forehead.\n\"Puff! Puff!\" Feeling the gentle warmth on his forehead, Cassian froze. Even his fur stopped moving. Now, he felt as if there were millions of butterflies wildly fluttering in his heart.\n...\nMeanwhile, the atmosphere in the Alliance military academy’s meeting room was getting increasingly tense, a total contrast to the warmth of the pet hospital.\nSolis stated firmly, \"Arix must return to the Koros Military Academy, and this is also for her own safety.\"\nSince receiving news of Arix being attacked the previous day, Solis had been seething with anger.\n\"Why should she? She clearly passed the entrance exams for our Hecaris Military Academy,\" Marlone retorted, not convinced.\nSolis pulled out a series of evidence regarding Raya’s actions and threw them in front of Marlone. He then righteously argued, \"Why? You, the Kerings, are utterly shameless! Raya Kering first stole the admission notice meant for her, then cruelly poisoned Arix. If Arix didn’t possess Supergiant-Class psychic powers, she would have died! Your family’s reputation will be ruined if that happens.\"\nMarlone wanted to argue, but looking at the evidence on the table, he felt guilty. He had also confronted Thaddeus about this matter last night, but seeing his elder brother’s hair streaked with white, he ultimately couldn’t bring himself to press further.\nThaddeus had dedicated his life to the Alliance. Marlone couldn’t bear to stop him from being selfish this one time.\nHe thought that maybe, just maybe, Arix going to the Koros Military Academy wasn’t such a bad thing after all. It might be the best outcome for her and for the Kering family.",

      "content": "Chapter 18: The Genetic Report\nMarlone was silent, but Laiden wasn’t ready to let the show end just yet. He smiled and said to the other four, \"Arix’s genetic report is out. Shouldn’t we take a look before we debate which military school she should attend? What if she’s one of our Lasairs...\"\nBefore Laiden could finish, Solis cut him off, \"She’s more likely from my family. Everyone knows my younger brother is a playboy, with illegitimate children lining up at our door for paternity tests, so the chances are higher that Arix is a Calix.\"\nUsually, the Calix family kept such scandals tightly under wraps. Now, for Arix, Solis was willing to bring it all up—a significant sacrifice indeed.\nThe other four hadn’t expected that family scandals could be useful at this moment. Even the usually eloquent Laiden was at a loss for words.\n\"I actually think Arix looks more like someone from my family, a Brant. After all, her talent with chemistry is there for all to see. Unfortunately, my family doesn’t have a lost descendent,\" Mendez said regretfully.\n\"The Rinn family doesn’t either,\" Shella said coldly, with a hint of relief in her tone.\nThe Rinn family already had enough trouble with the fearless Cirilla. Adding Arix, who caused an uproar at the five military schools in just four days, might be too much for the Rinn family to handle next.\nWhen it was Marlone’s turn, everyone silently agreed that the least likely possibility was the Kering family. After all, Arix had faced dangers repeatedly, all linked to people from the Kering family.\nMarlone thought similarly, so he just gave a wry smile and stayed quiet.\n\"Let me be the first to check who Arix really belongs to,\" Laiden said with a smile. He opened the genetic report from the Alliance Military Research Institute on his opticomputer.\n\"What... how is this possible!\" Laiden had started to read the genetic report calmly, but he was shocked when he saw Arix’s psychic power potential.\nSolis and the others had never seen Laiden lose his composure like this and realized the gravity of the situation. They quickly opened the genetic reports on their opticomputers.\n**The Alliance Military Research Institute Genetic Report**\n**Subject Name:** Arix Thalis\n**Sending Unit:** The Alliance Military School\n**Test Content:** Arix Thalis\n**Psychic Testing:** Supergiant Class+ (Potential Unknown)\n**Physical Testing:** Planet Class (Potential Unknown)\n**DNA Testing:** The test subject’s DNA is 99.9% similar to that of Alliance Admiral Thaddeus Kering. The father-daughter relationship is 100% confirmed.\nEver since everybody read the research report, the meeting room had been eerily silent. Both Arix’s mysterious origins and her exceptional abilities had shaken the normally composed school leaders.\n\"This is no longer a matter for the military academy to handle. Let’s report this to the president and the patriarch families,\" Laiden said gravely.\n\"Agreed.\"\n\"Agreed.\"\n...\nAfter unanimous agreement, Solis and the others quickly sent an urgent message to the president of the Alliance and the patriarchs—five admirals from the five noble families.\nOnce the message was sent, they stopped discussing which family Arix belonged to. Their argument turned useless because they didn’t have the right to make the decision anymore.\n\"But still, it’s surprising that Arix turns out to be Admiral Kering’s daughter... But wasn’t his daughter just found?\" Solis, who was most concerned about Arix, voiced his thoughts.\n\"Could it be that Admiral Kering had an affair?\" Laiden raised an eyebrow, feigning innocence.\n\"I’ll check,\" said Marlone, his expression serious as he opened his opticomputer. He felt that Laiden’s suggestion was likely.\nHe was somewhat accepting of Arix’s psychic power talent, so he was more concerned about his own elder brother suddenly turning from a model man into a major scoundrel.\nMr. and Mrs. Kering were regarded as a model couple in the Alliance. Marlone found it hard to believe that all this could be a facade.\nThe other three gave Marlone a silent look, feeling that he should be happy that his family had produced a prodigious talent.\nWhile Solis and the others couldn’t follow Marlone’s train of thought, their interest in the gossip flared intensely.\nAfter a moment of silent agreement, the examiners all looked towards Marlone’s opticomputer.\n\"What is it?\" Thaddeus’s cold voice filled the meeting room.\n\"How could you cheat on Fleur? How is that fair to her? She loves you so much,\" Marlone questioned in a serious tone.\n\"Marlone, what are you talking about? I’ve done no such thing,\" Thaddeus replied, his tone turning cold and angry.\n\"So I’m the crazy one? I’ll send the evidence to you and Fleur, explain it to her!\" Marlone snapped and then hung up the call.\nIn the Kering family study...\n\"What nonsense is he talking about?\" Thaddeus muttered after the call abruptly ended. He rubbed his temples wearily before turning back to handle the miscellaneous affairs of the fifth legion.\nMoments later, the study door was violently pushed open. The loud noise drew Thaddeus’s attention away from his tasks and towards the doorway.\nFleur stood there, only in her PJs, tears streaming down her face.\nThaddeus felt a pang in his heart. He quickly got up and went over to Fleur, asking with concern, \"Honey, why are you crying? Did Marlone talk nonsense to you too? Don’t believe him, I would never do such a thing.\"\n\"Honey, our daughter has come back,\" Fleur sobbed.\nThaddeus was stunned for a moment, then quickly reacted. He scrambled to open the information on his opticomputer. After reading the report, his eyes reddened and he trembled, \"It’s really our daughter... we’ve even met her before.\"\nThaddeus and Fleur both remembered the poor young girl was so thin, which only made their hearts ache more.\nThey couldn’t bear to think about how much their daughter, whom they cherished so deeply, had suffered over the years.\n\"Honey, I want to see our daughter, I can’t wait another moment,\" Fleur cried and rest her head on Thaddeus’s chest.\n\"Okay,\" Thaddeus quickly agreed, not just because he was eager, but also because he feared for the safety of the daughter they had only just found again.\nThe recent files detailed all of Arix’s encounters, including several recent attempts on her life. Thinking of these, Thaddeus’s gaze turned ice-cold as he looked determinedly into the distance.",

      "content": "Chapter 19: New Life\nAt the hospital, Arix was waiting for Cassian to finish his IV drip and had just consulted with the doctor. When she found out Cassian could go home, she hailed a Lev and brought him back with her.\nAs soon as she opened the door, she saw Thaddeus and Fleur sitting in her living room.\nArix paused, a bit hesitant, and asked, \"Mr. and Mrs. Kering, what brings you here?\"\nArix thought to herself, maybe Thaddeus and Fleur came because she was living in the Kering family’s apartment. She and their daughter, Raya, were enemies now. Thinking this, she felt it wasn’t right to stay in their house, so Arix decided she would move out soon.\nCassian, although unsure of what was happening, sensed Arix’s cautious tone. He looked thoughtfully at Thaddeus and Fleur, and then, he tenderly licked Arix’s fingers that was holding him.\nArix felt the warmth on her fingers. She thought the little puppy was just being mischievous out of boredom. So, she gently stroked Cassian’s fluffy body to calm him down.\nSince seeing Arix, Fleur had been overly emotional. She was so nervous that she seemed to have lost her ability to speak.\nShe had thought long about what to say to her daughter, but now that she was actually facing Arix, it felt as though her throat was blocked. She couldn’t express her years of longing.\nFleur was about to speak, her face full of guilt and nearly crying.\nArix, seeing this, thought she was embarrassed to ask her to leave.\nThey were Drexel’s parents, and Arix didn’t want to make it hard for them. So, she took it on herself and said, \"Is it because I’m staying here that I’m troubling you? I’ve already found a hotel and can move out soon, thank you for letting me stay.\"\nHearing this, Fleur almost fainted in Thaddeus’s arms. She struggled to compose herself and then urgently said, \"You can’t leave! I mean, I didn’t come to kick you out. Please, feel free to stay here as long as you like, okay?\"\n\"Honey, let me talk,\" Thaddeus said, soothing his wife’s panic. After calming Fleur, he smiled at Arix and said, \"Kid, why don’t you sit down first?\"\n\"Okay,\" Arix replied, a bit confused, and sat on the sofa opposite Thaddeus and Fleur. She looked up to see Fleur’s teary face, even more puzzled about what was going on.\nCassian was just as baffled. He thought,\n’Aren’t they supposed to be giving me a lecture? Why are they crying first?’\n\"Your name is Arix Thalis, right?\" Thaddeus asked in a gentle tone.\n\"Just call me Arix,\" she replied. Arix didn’t like Raya, but her resentment didn’t extend to Thaddeus, who had contributed a lot to the Alliance. Arix knew he was a man worthy of respect.\n\"Okay, Arix, I want to ask you something. Do you... remember your parents?\" Thaddeus asked intently, his eyes betraying a hint of nervousness.\nArix certainly remembered her parents — but those were her parents from her past life. She knew Thaddeus wasn’t asking about her past life; he was likely asking about the biological parents of the Old Arix.\nHowever, in the memories left to her by the Old Arix, there was no trace of her parents. The closest thing she had to family memories were those of the orphanage, mostly involving her friends and Sister Gwen.\nWith this in mind, Arix answered Thaddeus, \"I’m sorry, I don’t remember them.\"\n\"Then... if they came looking for you, would you want to meet them?\" Thaddeus asked cautiously.\nArix didn’t respond immediately, realizing what Thaddeus and Fleur were implying. She guessed that they might have found the biological parents of the Old Arix.\nArix hesitated, wondering if she should meet them. She thought about it from another perspective:\n’If the Old Arix were in my body, would I want her to pretend to be me and stay with my parents?’\nAfter a moment, Arix looked up at Thaddeus and Fleur and said, \"Even though they abandoned me on purpose, I’m still willing to meet them.\"\nOnce she had said it, Arix stopped dwelling on it. She thought that if someone could replace her and be with her parents, she would be grateful to that person.\nSo, Arix was also willing to be that person.\nFleur could no longer hold back. She got up and hugged Arix tightly, crying, \"We didn’t abandon you on purpose. You were kidnapped ten years ago. We’ve been looking for you all these years.\"\nArix was stunned. She stared at Fleur and said, \"You are my mother? But aren’t you Raya’s mother?\"\nFleur, afraid of any misunderstanding, quickly explained, \"No, my daughter is you, and only you. Everything you saw yesterday was just a play to catch the person behind her.\"\n\"What about her now?\" Arix asked, a bit curious.\n\"She has been detained. Once the military finishes investigating who’s behind her, the worst she’ll face is exile to a prison planet for life,\" Thaddeus said. Though his face remained calm, he had already determined a severe fate for the false Raya. He would not let anyone who dared to harm his daughter off easily.\nArix had not expected her revenge for the Old Arix to unfold in such a dramatic way. Everything felt surreal, yet she also felt sorry for the Old Arix.\nIf only the Old Arix had waited, perhaps the outcome would have been different.\nWhen it was late at night, Arix reluctantly saw Thaddeus and Fleur out. After promising to move back into the Kering family home the next day, she finally sent off her emotionally overwhelmed parents.\nThe room fell silent again, but Arix’s face showed no signs of loneliness.\nIn her interactions with them, Arix gradually came to accept her newfound parents.\nPerhaps the most interesting aspect for her was that Drexel had become her biological brother. She couldn’t help but look forward to seeing his face when he learned the truth.\nJust the thought of it made Arix chuckle to herself. Then, holding Cassian, she contentedly lay down on her bed and quickly fell asleep.\nThat night, Arix dreamt for the first time in a long while.\nThe dream took her to a room from her past life. Realizing this, she excitedly opened the door, eager to see her parents again.\nAfter some searching, she found them in the garden below the second-floor balcony. Just as she was about to greet them, another \"Arix\" appeared in her view.\nArix froze for a moment, then quickly hid behind the curtains, quietly observing the scene below.\nShe didn’t know how long she stood there, reluctant to shift her gaze away from the family of three below. Deep down, she felt this might be her last chance to see her parents.\nProbably, from now on, it would be the Old Arix who would stay by their side.\nYes, Arix had recognized the Old Arix by some minor habits. She was surprised but not saddened. After all, among all possible outcomes, this was perhaps the best.\nWith a sense of acceptance, Arix smiled briefly, then her figure slowly faded behind the curtains.\nAt the same time, the girl who had been chatting with Arix’s parents sensed something and looked up towards the second-floor window, but there was nothing unusual there anymore.",

      "content": "Chapter 20: Family Banquet\nThe next day, when Arix woke up, her mind was filled with dreams of her parents. She knew that things were as good as they could be, but she still couldn’t help feeling a bit down.\n\"Owwo...\" Cassian, who had just woken up, let out a puzzled sound when he saw Arix’s low spirits.\nHe slowly walked over to Arix’s head and buried himself in, trying to comfort her with his fluffy body.\nFeeling the fuzziness against her cheek, Arix couldn’t help smiling. She turned over and buried her face in Cassian’s belly, rubbing against it.\n\"Croissant, thank you,\" Arix said, feeling healed and warmly thinking to herself that fuzziness really was a cure-all.\n\"Ding ding.\"\nThe doorbell suddenly rang, and Arix, curious, looked up at the door. She got up to open it.\n\"Hey cousin, good morning.\" Varden, standing outside, pushed his glasses up on the bridge of his nose and greeted her with a warm smile.\n\"Good morning. What brings you here? I thought it might be Drexel or our big brother Kellan, or other family members coming over,\" Arix said, letting Varden in and asking with curiosity.\n\"Come on, don’t you like me? A cousin is still considered family,\" Varden joked as he entered.\n\"Of course. I was just curious,\" Arix hurried to appease him, not daring to offend this sly fox.\nVarden chuckled before continuing, \"There’s a family banquet at home today. It was supposed to be just relatives and friends of the Kering family, but somehow members from the other four major families also showed up. Except for Drexel, who is sick and couldn’t come, everyone is busy hosting the guests, so Aunt Fleur sent me to pick you up.\"\nArix thought it was just a simple family meal but was surprised to hear about the banquet. Remembering the dramatic holiday mishaps from her family in her past life, she felt a shiver run through her.\nSwallowing hard, Arix looked away and said, \"Um... Cousin Varden, I think I might have something else tonight. Can I skip that banquet, maybe?\"\nVarden raised an eyebrow and coldly countered, \"What are you thinking? You’re the reason why they told the banquet! Besides, Grandpa will also be there.\"\nTheir grandfather was one of the five great admirals of the Alliance, a man not even the President of the Alliance could easily meet.\nArix felt both honored and nervous. She struggled for a moment then firmly said, \"I’ll go!\"\nVarden smiled and stayed silent. The truth was, there were other important people coming tonight, but he dared not scare Arix away with that information. If Arix ran off, he and Fleur would have a huge problem.\n...\nAt the Kering’s back door, Varden stood inside, watching Arix who was hiding nearby. \"Stop hiding, they are all at the front door.\"\nArix coughed awkwardly. She came out from her hiding spot and entered, not forgetting to act tough, \"I wanted to surprise them, it’s no fun if they see me too early, right?\"\n\"You’d say that even to Drexel, and he wouldn’t believe you,\" Varden said with a cold laugh.\nArix clamped her mouth shut and obediently followed Varden up to a room on the third floor, watching quietly as he knocked on the door. \"Aunt Fleur, Arix is here.\"\nArix had been missing Fleur too. She quickly stood at the door, but as soon as it opened, her expression froze.\nInside the spacious room, Fleur was standing and chatting with a dozen ladies. As soon as they heard the door open, they all turned towards Arix and warmly crowded around her.\n\"Oh my, is this Arix? You look as beautiful as your mother. Don’t worry, we will dress you up beautifully today, to dazzle all those boys outside.\"\n\"And these eyes, so big and bright, like a deer’s, I’m so jealous.\"\n\"This skin is so tender and smooth, just like a peeled egg.\"\n\"And such a well-proportioned body, this bum could definitely bear healthy, chubby babies.\"\nArix internally screamed for help. She felt like a maiden surrounded by rogues; one lady touched her here, another miss pinched her there.\nIn desperation, she looked to Varden for help, but he simply threw her a helpless look and quickly slipped out, even shutting the door behind him.\n’Varden! I hate you!’\nArix watched incredulously as Varden escaped with ease, cursing him silently.\nAfterward, she went numb. She closed her eyes in despair, letting the ladies apply makeup and jewelry on her as they pleased.\nVarden, having escaped the chaotic scene, made his way down to the first floor. He looked sympathetically at the third floor for a moment before resuming his dashing young master demeanor and heading towards the main hall.\nIt didn’t take long for Varden to enter the grand banquet hall. Before him, it was a luxuriously styled hall, with exquisite Rococo tables and chairs.\nEven the buffet table, laden with delicate food, was decorated with seashells and crystals, exuding luxury everywhere.\nThe hall was bustling with guests, the atmosphere cheerful and harmonious as conversations flowed easily among them.\nIn the corner of the banquet, Elio spotted Varden and called out, \"Varden, over here.\"\nVarden raised an eyebrow in surprise and approached Elio and a few others, asking, \"How come you guys are here too?\"\nElio, along with Zephyr and Cirilla, were idly sitting on chairs. Seeing Varden perked them up a bit.\n\"Family obligation. We had to come, like it or not,\" Elio said with a helpless shrug.\nCirilla and Zephyr echoed the sentiment.\nAfter all, the host of the banquet was the only well-known Supergiant+ level of the Alliance, and it was also the Kering family’s celebration for finding their missing lady. All heirs from various families were required to attend unless there were special circumstances.\nVarden’s question was casual, and after nodding in response to the answers, he casually picked a spot next to the three and sat down.\n\"So, has Drexel recovered?\" Elio asked, a bit awkwardly.\n\"He’s not too bad. With some more rest, he should be almost back to normal,\" Varden responded. He was actually surprised that Elio would even care about Drexel, and he smiled slightly at the thought.\nRelieved, Elio then began to gossip gleefully, \"I couldn’t believe it when I heard that Arix is Supergiant+ level. At first, I thought someone was spreading rumors.\"\n\"Supergiant+, huh? Wonder if there’ll be a chance to spar,\" Cirilla said, her expression tinged with excitement.\nThinking of Arix still getting ready in the room, Varden replied, \"Not likely today.\"\n\"Then we’ll just have to wait for another time,\" Cirilla said, sounding disappointed.\nAfter chatting for a while, the banquet officially began.\nMatis, the head of the Kering family, stood on the stage with Arix, who was dressed in fine attire.\nMatis then spoke into the microphone, \"First of all, thank you all for being here. I have a happy announcement to make—my granddaughter Arix Kering has been found and returned to us today. I thank everyone for your blessings and assistance. I hope you all have a joyful time here and leave with great memories. Thank you.\"\n\"Mr. Kering, congratulations.\"\nAfter Matis finished speaking, the crowd gave him the respect of robust applause. The whole hall was filled with a thunderous clapping.\nArix did not revert to her original name, Raya Kering, as she had grown accustomed to the name Arix.\nThaddeus and Fleur, out of respect for Arix, didn’t ask her to use the name Raya anymore. Thus, she only changed her surname to Kering.\nStanding on the stage, Arix realized that from today onwards, there would be no Arix Thalis in the world anymore.\nOnce again, Arix said goodbye to her former self and her past life. She bowed in gratitude to the guests.\nThen she began to reluctantly follow her grandfather, greeting and toasting the elders until late into the night, when the family reunion banquet finally concluded.\nThis freew(e)bnovel.(c)om",

      "content": "Chapter 21: One Month Later\n\"Arix, you’re reading this boring stuff again?\" Cirilla’s playful voice carried a hint of disbelief.\nCassian was curled up on Arix’s legs. He opened his eyes to look at Cirilla, then lay back down with a look of disdain.\nArix was reading a book in the garden at that moment. Hearing this, she put down her\n\"Complete Guide to Mecha Design\"\nand looked at Cirilla. She smiled helplessly and said, \"I thought you had gone back to Mulado. School starts the day after tomorrow, after all.\"\nThis past month had really tested Arix’s patience. All she wanted was to quietly study mecha, but Cirilla always dragged her into fights, calling it ’training together.’\nCirilla looked at her with the expression of a bossy cat looking at a foolish servant and retorted, \"All military students need to receive professional trainings before the school really starts. Our military training will last a month, right at Hecaris. Why bother going back to Mulado just to come back? Look, I’m not here to fight today. Wait... drop that sad face of yours, okay?\"\nAfter a month of spending time together, Cirilla had come to understand Arix quite well.\nBesides mecha, which could always catch her interest, Arix was like a lazy fish in other matters, the kind that only let water bring them to anywhere.\nHearing this, Arix breathed a sigh of relief. She immediately put on a smile and asked, \"So, what brings you here? Is it good news or bad?\"\n\"Of course it’s good news,\" Cirilla said haughtily, then continued, \"There’s a mecha auction this afternoon. Are you interested?\"\n\"Interested? What kind of mecha is up for auction?\" Arix perked up immediately at the mention of mecha.\n\"I don’t know exactly. All I heard is that Master Gunder just made a new mecha, and it’s a Star-Class,\" Cirilla said, her eyes sparkling with excitement.\n\"Star-Class! It will be an exclusive mecha then.\" Arix gasped.\n\"Exactly, an exclusive mecha,\" Cirilla’s eyes shone with excitement.\nEach exclusive mecha was an important strategic asset for the Alliance. Usually, they didn’t allow anyone but soldiers to pilot them.\nEven military students of the Alliance had to get a recommendation letter from the military academy and approval from the Alliance corps to purchase their own exclusive mechas.\nThe AI chip in an exclusive mecha, like that in common mechas, had superb computing capabilities; however, the exclusive mecha’s chip boasted an attractive independence— to pilot it, one must bind their psychic power with it.\nOnce bound, unless the owner died, the exclusive mecha could not be bound to another person.\nFor a mecha pilot, owning an exclusive mecha was like having a faithful partner who would never betray you and could be relied upon to fight side by side on the battlefield.\nArix had ranked in the top ten in her last exams, which normally meant she would be rewarded with a Comet-Class common mecha. However, she hadn’t yet received any news about this common mecha, making the dream of owning an exclusive mecha seem even more distant.\nArix sighed, accepting her reality. \"An exclusive mecha would be great. But without the school’s recommendation and the corps’ approval, even if I bought one, it would just sit around as a doll. Still... it would be nice to just go and take a look.\"\n\"I actually have an old one. Unfortunately, my family thinks I’ve been spending too much and started controlling my allowance. I can’t afford a new one,\" Cirilla sighed too.\nThinking she needed to invite other friends, Cirilla didn’t linger much longer. She agreed to pick up Arix at 14:00 that afternoon and left in a hurry.\nAfter watching Cirilla leave, Arix didn’t go back to her book but instead picked up Cassian and started petting him.\n\"Ow,\" Cassian made a comfortable sound with his soft, milky voice. He nuzzled against Arix’s fingers touching him.\n\"Croissant, do you know about the therians of the Empire?\" Arix asked casually.\nCassian stiffened for a moment, then quickly relaxed. Pretending not to understand, he guiltily licked his fur.\nArix felt the little body under her fingers stiffen briefly. Her eyes drooped, and she felt she already knew the answer.\nAlthough Arix spent almost every day with Cassian, she wasn’t the one who uncovered this secret.\nA few days ago, Drexel accidentally saw Cassian tidying up her room. He secretly collected a few of Cassian’s hairs and sent them for testing, only to confirm that this cute little puppy was indeed a therian.\nDrexel’s face turned green with anger, and he stormed off to tell Arix about it.\nAlthough surprised, Arix took it well. Whether puppy or therian, he was still Croissant, the one who cheered her up every day, and that was enough for her.\nCassian was silent for a while, realizing his identity might have been discovered.\nHe felt uneasy for a long time.\nBut when he looked up and saw Arix smiling at him as always, he gathered the courage to jump down from her lap.\nWhen Arix could see Cassian clearly again, there was a little boy with silver hair in his place. He looked at her nervously with big golden eyes and said in a soft voice, \"Arix, I didn’t mean to deceive you.\"\nArix was so charmed she felt she could barely breathe. She touched her forehead, trying hard not to faint from his cuteness.\nAfter a moment, she gently said to Cassian, \"It’s okay, I’m not mad. Croissant... I mean, you’re a therian, so you must have your own name, right?\"\n\"Cassian, not Croissant. I’m not a piece of bread,\" Cassian said, still harboring some resentment towards his old name, emphasizing it a bit.\nArix coughed awkwardly and changed the subject, \"The Empire is very strict about protecting young ones, how did you end up all alone in the Alliance?\"\n\"A month ago, I fell into a wormhole. When I woke up, I saw you. Also, I’m not a youngling; I’m already 18 years old. The reason I look like this is because my psychic power hasn’t fully recovered yet. Give it some time, and I’ll be back to normal,\" Cassian insisted firmly on his age.\nArix was amused by Cassian’s serious little expression. She chuckled affectionately, \"Alright, I know you’re not a youngling. Are you happy now?\"\nCassian nodded contentedly. He sat close to Arix, curiosity sparking in his eyes, \"How did you figure out I was a therian? I thought I hid it well.\"\n\"Guess,\" Arix teased, winking playfully.\nCassian took the challenge seriously and thought hard, but he couldn’t figure it out. He really couldn’t pinpoint when he might have slipped up in front of Arix.\nSeeing Cassian’s brow furrow as if he were an old man, Arix laughed and interrupted, \"Okay, stop thinking about it. It’s not important. It’s lunchtime now, and it’s a good opportunity for me to introduce you to everyone.\"\nWith that, Arix naturally took Cassian’s hand and started walking towards the dining hall.\nShe didn’t notice that Cassian’s cheeks were slowly turning pink behind her, his eyes sparkling with an enchanting light.",

      "content": "Chapter 22: Prince Cassian\nIn the dinning room, Drexel was sitting next to the dining table. As soon as he saw Arix, he couldn’t help but tease, \"Finally, we can eat, Arix. You know what they say, ’If you’re not eager to eat, something’s wrong with your brain.’ And once again, you’re the last to arrive.\"\nArix hadn’t even had the chance to retort when Fleur tapped Drexel on the back of his head. \"How can you talk to your sister like that? You don’t act like a brother at all, always thinking about eating. Arix, come sit next to mom.\"\nAfter scolding Drexel, Fleur immediately turned to Arix with a kind expression.\n\"Alright, thanks, Mom. You’re always the best to me,\" Arix said mockingly, then turned his head to provoke Drexel with a look.\n\"You!\" Drexel was nearly choked with anger. But when he saw Fleur giving him the stare, he could only swallow his saliva meekly.\nKellan, who was watching the whole scene, rolled his eyes, showing his disappointment in his own brother.\nThaddeus was smiling for a while until he noticed a little kid hiding behind Arix, which made him ask with some confusion, \"Arix, who is this child?\"\n\"Dad, this is Cassian. He used to be Croissant, that little dog,\" Arix stepped aside, revealing Cassian to everyone.\nThaddeus, initially calm, froze upon seeing Cassian’s appearance — silver hair and golden eyes, symbols of the Empire’s royalty, yet here in the Alliance. Then it struck him that just recently, the crown prince of the Empire had gone missing.\nThinking this, Thaddeus trembled as he picked up a cup from the table and took a sip of water to maintain his composure. However, the twitching at the corner of his eyes betrayed his inner turmoil.\n\"Croissant, wasn’t that your little dog?\" Kellan asked in surprise.\nHearing the crown prince of the Empire being referred to as a dog, Thaddeus nearly choked on his water.\nThaddeus managed to swallow his water and quickly told Kellan, \"Kellan, he is a wolf.\"\nDrexel looked skeptically at Cassian. \"Whether a dog or a wolf, this little guy is clearly a therian and even pretended to be a pet. Could he be a spy sent by the Empire?\"\nArix glared at Drexel and snapped, \"How could Croissant possibly be a spy? If the Empire sent a kid over, are they sending a spy or just sending him to death?\"\n\"You always pick on your sister. How could a little kid be a spy?\" Fleur scolded Drexel. She walked over, picked up Cassian, and comforted him, \"Your name is Cassian, right? You’re so pretty. We won’t bother with this naughty boy, let’s go eat.\"\nCassian blinked his adorable puppy eyes and sweetly said, \"Thank you, Mrs. Kering. You are very pretty too.\"\nFleur was instantly charmed by Cassian’s cuteness and smiled even more brightly, \"Good boy.\"\nArix snorted triumphantly at Drexel. He then sat next to Fleur and they started discussing what living essentials to buy for Cassian.\nDrexel, with a pout, watched the three of them having a good time. Seeing his mother and sister fuss over the \"little wolf,\" he couldn’t help feeling jealous and went to complain to Thaddeus, \"Dad, aren’t you going to do something? This kid’s background is totally unknown.\"\nThaddeus, holding his cup of water, glanced at his naïve son and finally advised, \"Don’t offend him, just treat him as if a VIP has come to our home.\"\n\"What?\" Drexel was completely baffled.\nAfter the meal, Arix told her parents she would go out with Cirilla in the afternoon. Then she went back to her room on the third floor to take a nap.\nCassian wanted to follow, but Drexel, with a sneer, stopped him.\nWith a forced smile, Drexel said to Fleur, \"Mom, he doesn’t have a room yet, right? Shouldn’t we prepare one for him?\"\nIt then occurred to Fleur that Cassian didn’t have a place to stay. She quickly instructed the housekeeper, \"Evelyn, prepare a room for Cassian, pick the one next to Arix’s. Make sure the furniture is soft, and the style is simple and elegant... actually, I’ll go with you to choose.\"\nAs Fleur left, Drexel was satisfied. He gave Cassian a smug, fake smile, \"Don’t thank me, now.\"\nAfter saying this, Drexel hummed a tune and walked out of the dining room.\nKellan looked at Cassian, who seemed ready to bite, and gave a helpless smile before following Drexel out of the room.\nCassian, frustrated, watched Drexel leave and then sat back down, politely calling out to Thaddeus, \"Mr. Kering.\"\nThaddeus responded and, seeing that only he and Cassian were left in the dining room, unleashed his psychic power to enclose the space.\n\"Mr. Kering, what’s this?\" Cassian, surrounded by psychic power, wasn’t nervous, just puzzled.\n\"Your Highness,\" Thaddeus stood up, placing his right hand on his chest, performing a greeting from the Empire.\nCassian was surprised, but seeing Thaddeus perform the royal gesture of the Empire, he quickly returned it. Then he smiled and said, \"Mr. Kering, you don’t need to be so formal, just call me Cassian.\"\nThaddeus nodded with a smile and asked curiously, \"Your Highness, how did you suddenly come to the Alliance, and to be with my daughter?\"\nCassian briefly explained, \"I owe Arix my thanks for saving me... It all happens...\"\nAfter listening, Thaddeus reflected on Arix’s luck. The little dog she had casually saved turned out to be the crown prince of the Empire. If their family were in the Empire, they might have been rewarded with a title.\nThen, Thaddeus asked Cassian, \"Your Highness, when do you plan to return to the Empire? Do you need help contacting anyone there?\"\nCassian fell silent upon the question. He thought for a moment, and then replied, \"Thank you for your kindness. I will contact the embassy in two days to arrange my return to the Empire. I’ll be in your care for these next couple of days.\"\n\"It will be an honor, Your Highness. I’ll leave to attend to some official matters now; please make yourself at home,\" Thaddeus responded.\nIf anything were to happen to Cassian, his family could become pariahs in the Alliance.\nCassian nodded to Thaddeus, watching him leave. He looked in the direction where Arix had gone for a long time before finally turning his gaze away.",

      "content": "Chapter 23: Mecha Auction\nArix woke up, yawned, and checked the time; it was already 1:30 PM.\nAfter quickly getting ready, Arix prepared to go to the front door to wait for Cirilla.\nBut just as she opened his bedroom door, she saw Cassian alone, leaning on the hallway windowsill, boredly watching the garden below.\n\"Cassian, what are you doing here all by yourself?\" Arix walked over and picked him up gently.\nCassian wrapped his little arms around Arix’s neck, nuzzling her like a kitten, \"Can I go to the auction with you, please, Arix?\"\nArix, utterly charmed, quickly surrendered, \"Alright, alright, we’ll go together.\"\n\"You’re the best,\" Cassian said with a sweet smile.\n\"You little rascal.\" Arix affectionately scratched Cassian’s nose. She then took Cassian’s hand and they went downstairs to the living room.\nIn the living room, Fleur was knitting a sweater. Hearing footsteps, she stopped her knitting. Then she turned her head and asked softly, \"Cassian, Arix, did you just wake up?\"\n\"Yeah, just woke up. Mom, where’s Drexel?\" Arix asked casually.\nThaddeus and Kellan were soldiers in the Alliance, likely at the military base now. Only Drexel and Arix were military students.\n\"He’s still sleeping in his bedroom, let him be; the rascal must have been up all night playing in the Connective Pod,\" Fleur said with a hint of disdain.\nArix laughed. She checked the time and said to Fleur, \"Mom, I’m meeting a friend soon, Cassian and I will head out now.\"\n\"Go ahead. I had your dad transfer 5 million astrocredits to your account. If you or Cassian find anything you like, buy it. If it’s not enough, ask your dad to send more,\" Fleur instructed.\n\"Thanks, Mom, we’ll be going then.\" Arix, surprised by the generous spending money, smiled in delight.\n\"Bye, Mrs. Kering,\" Cassian waved his little chubby hand.\n\"Goodbye, Cassian. Have fun with Arix,\" Fleur said with a tender smile, waving back.\nAfter they left, Drexel peeked his head over the second-floor railing, pleading, \"Mom, can I have 1 million too? I want a new Connective Pod.\"\nFleur’s gaze was as sharp as a cold knife, and she fiercely spat out a word, \"Scram!\"\nDrexel quickly pulled back his head, grumbling under his breath, \"Fine, don’t give it then. I’ll just borrow from Arix.\"\n\"If I hear you’ve asked Arix for even a penny, you can forget about seeing a single credit for the next term,\" Fleur’s chilling voice came from downstairs, as if she had read her second son’s mind.\nDrexel, feeling wronged, considered running away from home. However, realizing he still had a functioning Connective Pod in his room, he reluctantly called down, \"Alright, I get it.\"\nFleur snorted coldly as she continued to knit the sweater for her beloved daughter.\n...\nAt the grand entrance of the Kering family home, Cirilla called out from her Lev, spotting Arix and Cassian.\n\"Arix, over here!\" Cirilla shouted as she rolled down the window and stuck her head out.\nArix smiled and greeted her. She led Cassian to the back seat of the Lev.\n\"Is this kid a family of yours?\" Cirilla asked, glancing back at Cassian as she sat in the driver’s seat.\n\"Yes, he’s my cousin, his name is Cassian,\" Arix replied, keeping it simple.\n\"He looks pretty adorable. Buckle up, we’re about to take off,\" Cirilla said. Then she started the Lev, lifting it into the air.\nShe sped forward.\n\"Cirilla, I didn’t know you were so rich. This Lev, I remember, costs around a hundred million astrocredits,\" Arix remarked, impressed by the understated luxury of the interior.\n\"That’s nothing compared to Elio’s Lev. His starts at a billion,\" Cirilla replied nonchalantly.\n\"A billion? That’s enough to buy a Comet-Class mecha,\" Arix swallowed hard, hardly believing that a Lev could cost as much as a mecha.\n\"What’s a billion for a Lev? Lasair once sold five top-level luxury Levs made from Supergiant-Class insectoid shells. Each one cost hundreds of billions. Only the admirals of the four major families and the president of the Alliance could afford them, and Elio himself owns one,\" Cirilla said, slightly envious of Elio’s notorious wealth in the Alliance.\nArix almost turned green with envy, not so much for the Levs, but because Supergiant-Class insectoid shells were top-tier materials for building mechas, and Lasair was so wealthy that they could afford to use them for Levs.\n\"If you like, I can give you one in the future,\" Cassian mentioned. He recalled that Lasair had once gifted a Lev to the Empire to expand their business, and it had since been collecting dust in his garage. \"If you want it, I’ll give it to you when we get back to the Empire.\"\nArix smiled at the offer and patted Cassian’s hair, taking his words lightly, \"Sure, thanks, Cassian.\"\nCirilla heard Cassian’s grand statement and took it as the innocent boast of a child, laughing along with Arix.\nAfter a while, they arrived at the auction venue. Cirilla parked the Lev in the parking lot and led Arix and Cassian to the auction entrance.\nTwelve young women dressed in kimonos were standing in two rows at the entrance.\nAnother man in a suit bowed respectfully to Cirilla and her companions, \"Honored guests, hello, please show your invitation.\"\nCirilla nodded and pulled a pure black invitation with golden sakura blossoms from her pocket. She then handed it to the attendant.\nUpon seeing the sakura emblem on the invitation, the attendant became even more respectful.\nHe opened the invitation, glanced at it, and then he handed it back to Cirilla with both hands, saying, \"It’s an honor to see you, Miss Rinn. Please come in. Miss Ame, please take the young ladies and the gentleman to the VIP box.\"\n\"Okay, thank you. Everyone, please follow me,\" said Ame, one of the girls in kimonos. She walked in front of Cirilla’s group, bowing slightly.\n\"Arix, let’s go,\" Cirilla said, looking at Arix.\n\"Okay,\" Arix replied, holding Cassian’s hand and following the others.",

      "content": "Chapter 24: The Auction Starts\nAs soon as Arix walked into the auction, the first thing that caught his eye was a luxurious corridor.\nThe wide corridor was adorned with a crystal chandelier every five meters, casting a soft, gentle light.\nOn either side of the corridor, the walls were embedded with a row of glass cabinets filled with exquisite antiques and limited-edition luxury items, and most surprisingly, rare mecha materials.\nArix looked calm and collected, but inside, she was dying to press her face against the glass for a better look at these rare mecha materials.\n\"Here we are, everyone,\" said the kimono girl named Ame, as she gently pushed open the door to a private room.\nShe then bowed slightly, making a welcoming gesture with her hand.\n’So soon? I’m not ready to say goodbye to the materials yet,’\nArix thought, disappointed.\nArix looked mournfully at Ame, her heart storming with silent cries.\nFeeling the intensity of Arix’s gaze, Ame tightened up, anxiously lowering her head. She wondered what she had done wrong to upset the guest and worried about a possible complaint that could cost her this hard-earned, well-paying job.\nArix, who had worked part-time jobs in her past life, understood the girl’s feelings all too well.\nFeeling a bit guilty, she quickly pretended to start a casual conversation with Cirilla, \"Cirilla, let’s come back after the auction and take another look at these collections. I haven’t had enough yet.\"\n\"Huh? Okay,\" Cirilla agreed, a bit confused but nodding obediently.\n\"Arix, I’ll come with you too,\" Cassian said sweetly.\n\"Thank you, Cassian,\" Arix said, pinching Cassian’s cheek before taking her hand and walking into the room.\nJust as Ame was about to close the door, Arix turned and smiled at Ame, \"And thank you too, Miss Ame.\"\nAs the door finally closed, the previously anxious Ame stood frozen for a moment before her eyes softened and she whispered softly, \"You’re welcome, miss.\"\nThe VIP box was on the second floor of the auction house.\nAs Arix stepped inside, the first thing she noticed one of the four walls was a massive one-way window.\nIn front of the window, there was a couch and a low coffee table.\nOn the coffee table, besides some fresh fruits, there was an opticomputer that introduced the auction items. Guests could simply sit on the couch, click on an item on the opticomputer, and the item would appear as a holographic projection, displaying its details in mid-air.\nAt that moment, a young man was lounging on the couch, boredly watching the bustling auction scene outside the window.\nHe turned his head towards Cirilla and Arix as they entered. \"Sis, is she the friend you mentioned earlier?\" he asked curiously, looking at Arix.\n\"Yes, this is Arix, she’s the daughter of Uncle Thaddeus, and this little guy next to her is her cousin, named Cassian,\" Cirilla introduced.\n\"So you are Uncle Thadeus’s daughter? Hi, I’m Adrian Rinn, Cirilla’s twin brother. It’s an honor to meet you,\" Adrian said as he stood up and reached out his hand, his smile radiating like a morning sun.\n\"Thank you,\" Arix replied, smiling back as she shook his hand.\nSeeing their hands shake, Cassian, who had been left aside, suddenly felt unhappy and stared intently at their clasped hands.\nHis eyes twinkled for a moment before he pretended to be weak, swaying Arix’s hand, \"Arix, I’m so tired, my legs hurt.\"\nThinking Cassian was just tired from walking, Arix let go of Adrian’s hand and lifted Cassian onto the couch, gently massaging his calves.\n\"How’s that? Feeling any better?\" Arix asked with concern.\nLooking into Arix’s caring eyes, Cassian’s face heated up a bit, and his voice turned sweet, \"It doesn’t hurt anymore, thank you, Arix.\"\nAdrian, observing the adorable interaction between Arix and Cassian, couldn’t help joking with Cirilla, \"Sis, my legs hurt too, why don’t you give me a massage?\"\n\"The kind where I break your leg?\" Cirilla replied with a cold smile.\nAdrian’s smile froze, and he sheepishly pulled his head back. Then he quickly changed the subject, \"The auction is starting.\"\nThe lights over the auction stage downstairs suddenly brightened, and the noisy auction hall quieted down in an instant.\nEveryone, from the VIPs in the private boxes to the masked ordinary attendees below, turned their attention to the stage.\nThe sound of high heels clicking echoed through the hall, and as the footsteps drew nearer, a spotlight shone on the backstage area, revealing a beautiful and curved woman stepping forward.\nWith a proper smile and graceful movements, the woman approached the small lectern at the front of the auction stage.\nShe scanned the crowd and spoke with an elegant voice, \"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to today’s auction hosted by the Lasair Corporation. My name is Amara. I’ll be your host today. Without further ado, let’s present the first auction item.\"\nAs Amara finished speaking, a kimono girl approached from backstage, carrying a wooden tray to Amara’s side.\nShe then presented the item to the audience below.\nAmara turned on the giant screen behind her, and it displayed the item being auctioned. Simultaneously, the coffee table in the private boxes started playing a holographic image of the auction item.\nAs the auction went on, Amara introduced the first item with elegance, \"Our first item up for bid is a Star-Class Insectoid Crystal. This Insectoid Crystal is a primary material for Psychic Wares. Its excellent condition makes it highly likely to succeed in crafting Psychic Ware. Interested Psychic Ware Masters should be ready to bid. The starting bid is 500,000 astrocredits, with increments of at least 50,000.\"\nAfter her introduction, Amara began to call out the bids as customers in the hall raised their placards to show their offers, and prices appeared on the floor-to-ceiling window of the second-floor private box.\n\"Number 82 bids 550,000. Do we have a higher offer? Good, Number 79 bids 600,000... Number 62, 900,000. Any further bids? Good, 900,000 once, 900,000 twice, and a bid from VIP box number 8—1 million. Any higher? Going once at 1 million, going twice at 1 million, and sold for 1 million astrocredits to the guest in VIP box number 8. Congratulations! The item will be delivered to your room shortly.\"\nWith the successful bid concluded, Amara then moved on to introduce the next item up for auction.",

      "content": "Chapter 25: An Invasion\nIn the VIP box, Adrian frowned and said, \"It’s been almost half an hour, when will it be the turn for the bio-mecha?\"\nArix checked the opticomputer on the coffee table and comforted him, \"Just three more events to go.\"\nCassian scrunched his brow, feeling an unexplainable sense of crisis urging him to leave with Arix, but looking down at the noisy auction below, he thought he might be overthinking it.\n\"Cassian, what’s wrong? Are you feeling okay?\" Arix, noticing Cassian’s troubled expression, pulled him into a hug, concerned.\nCassian pursed his lips and just held onto Arix, silent.\nHe knew Arix was really looking forward to the last auction and didn’t want to disappoint her because of his own feelings.\nAfter looking at Cassian for a while, Arix still felt worried and said to Cirilla, \"Cirilla, Cassian feels unwell, I’m going to take him home.\"\n\"Arix, I’m fine, the bio-mecha is almost up. Let’s wait to see it before we leave,\" Cassian said, shaking his head reluctantly.\n\"Yeah, Arix, the next one is the exclusive mecha. It’s a pity to leave now,\" Cirilla also tried to persuade them.\nBut Arix, seeing Cassian’s pale face, could no longer care about the mecha. All she felt was worry. \"No, let’s see it some other time.\"\n\"Alright then, you and Cassian head back first. Adrian, you escort Arix home. I’ll stay and handle the auction of the bio-mecha,\" Cirilla said.\nShe had the task of securing this Star-Class bio-mecha for her family. Thus, she could only ask Adrian to send them home.\n\"No problem.\" Adrian had already been impatient, so he agreed quickly.\nArix thanked Cirilla, then followed Adrian out of the box.\nOutside the box, in a corner unnoticed by the three, a fist-sized wormhole was rapidly expanding.\nFrom the depths of the hole, a dense, harsh buzzing of insectoids could be heard.\nBack in the box not far from the wormhole, Cirilla was alone, intently watching the auction podium downstairs, oblivious to any anomaly.\nMeanwhile, the atmosphere at the auction had reached its peak with the appearance of the bio-mecha.\nPeople shouted and raised their bids frantically, unaware that danger was approaching.\nArix and Adrian exited the auction venue and reached the parking lot. Just when they were about to get into the car, a piercing alarm sounded from the auction hall.\n\"What’s happening?\" Arix hadn’t figured out what was going on when Adrian, looking terrified, suddenly yelled, \"Sis!\"\nAdrian then said hurriedly, turning pale, \"Go ahead, Arix. I need to go back and save my sister!\"\nWithout waiting for Arix’s response, he ran back toward the auction hall, too fast for Arix to stop him.\nArix’s expression darkened. Even though she didn’t know exactly what had happened, Adrian’s reaction told her that Cirilla was in danger.\n\"Arix, there might be a wormhole inside the auction hall,\" Cassian finally understood what that vague sense of crisis was.\nAfter all, he had once fallen into a wormhole and survived by the skin of his teeth; he was not mistaken about that feeling.\n\"How could this be? This is the center of Hecaris,\" Arix’s face turned pale instantly.\nWormholes are narrow tunnels in the universe connecting two different times and spaces, inhabited by at least one Star-Class insectoid and countless Planet-Class or lower insectoids.\nThe appearance of such a wormhole in the planet’s center city could bring a disaster akin to the end of the world.\n\"Cassian, I need to go and block that wormhole. Stay in the car and don’t run around! Wait for me to come back,\" Arix put Cassian in the car and instructed firmly before she turned and ran toward the auction hall.\nShe came from a family of soldiers; she could not abandon ordinary people in danger, especially when a friend was inside.\nCassian reached out his hands, trying to stop Arix, but his short, chubby arms couldn’t even catch the edge of her coat as she turned.\nWatching her running farther away, Cassian’s pupils suddenly contracted, and he yelled frantically, \"Arix! Come back!\"\nArix, who had already run into the auction hall, didn’t hear Cassian’s shouts amid the chaotic screams for help.\nAt that moment, she was running against the crowd into the auction hall.\nFinally, she saw Cirilla and Adrian standing in front of the wormhole. They were releasing all their psychic powers to form a barrier, seemingly trying to block the wormhole.\nBut the wormhole was too large, and many insectoids were still escaping through the gaps.\nFortunately, there were some people that Arix could detect a military demeanor in front of the auction podium. They were also fighting desperately to prevent the insectoids from escaping the hall, tearing the insectoids that crawled out from the cracks.\nEven Amara, who looked elegant and beautiful, was slashing insectoids with a dashing grace. However, the incessant attacks from the insectoids gradually made her struggle. It did not diminish her beauty; instead, it added a worn charm to her appearance.\nThe stunning sight of a beautiful woman in battle stirred up the blood of all the males present, and they showed no fear even in the face of the endlessly crawling out insectoids.\n\"I’d die here today and it’d still be worth it with Amara by my side. What do you say, Hank?\" a man roared with bravado.\n\"Hah, I wonder if I could take Amara out for dinner after this is over?\" Hank, somewhat familiar with Amara, didn’t forget to flirt with her even amidst the fight.\nAmara responded with a charming smile and solemnly announced to everyone, \"After this is over, I, Amara, will treat all the brave men here to a dinner party, and we won’t go home until we’re drunk as a skunk.\"\n\"Alright! Amara, you have my word. We’ll definitely get rid of the bugs and drink with you like a fish,\" Hank laughed heartily.\nHe then focused back on the incessant insectoids in front of him and roared, \"Everyone, did you hear that? Lady Amara will take us to a party after this is over. How can you not give it your all? Charge!!\"\n\"Go!\"\n\"Kill them all!\"\nA resounding echo of agreement burst forth around him.\nSome were struck down or even killed by the insectoids, but not a single person stepped back.\nThey understood that behind them were countless unarmed civilians. If they retreated and were defeated, allowing the insectoids a chance to escape, it would cause irreparable disaster to countless civilians outside.",

      "content": "Chapter 26: Cassian Grew Up\nArix barely opened her eyes, shocked at the horrific scene in front of her. She bit her lip to hold back her sadness.\nShe quickly ran to the side of Cirilla and Adrian, who were completely exhausted from using up all their psychic power.\n\"Arix?\" Adrian looked at Arix with a tired face, surprised.\n\"Arix! Why did you come back?\" Cirilla was still holding up a psychic power barrier, her eyes wide with disbelief.\n\"Why didn’t you run away?\" Arix asked back instead of answering.\nCirilla said, irritated, \"How did you... You trying to make me mad or something? I told you to leave! Do you really love us that much that you want to die with us here?\"\nArix laughed bitterly. She turned her gaze back, her expression serious. She stared at the wormhole, \"Leave the rest to me, you guys can rest up.\"\nWith no further delay, Arix began to harness all the psychic power within her psychic world. The power slowly formed a massive psychic barrier, which soon enveloped the wormhole completely.\nInside, the trapped insectoids screeched in frustration.\nTheir sharp, cold-gleaming limbs attacked the psychic barrier relentlessly, but all their efforts were futile.\n\"That’s power of a Supergiant+?\" Cirilla, who had already withdrawn her psychic energy, watched Arix’s silhouette in awe.\n\"Wow, sis, Arix is really kicking some ass,\" Adrian said admiringly.\nCirilla, for once not objecting, responded with mixed feelings, \"Well, she’s just getting started, I guess.\"\nOnce the insectoids escaping the wormhole had been dealt with, people in the auction hall almost all collapsed to the ground, gasping for breath.\nSeveral severely wounded individuals passed out, and those who could still stand all turned their attention to the young girl sealing the wormhole.\n\"Who is this girl? She’s quite something. The supergiant-class siblings couldn’t fully seal it, but she managed it alone,\" Hank said, gasping and clearly impressed.\nHank’s friend, wiping blood from his mouth, raised an eyebrow at Hank, \"You really don’t know?\"\n\"Just spit it out. Don’t beat around the bush like that—it’s annoying,\" Hank grumbled, frustrated with the evasion, especially coming from a tough guy like his friend.\nUnoffended, Hank’s friend just sighed, \"It’s no wonder you’ve been just a small squad leader in the Fifth Legion for a decade; you don’t even recognize Admiral Kering granddaughter. You should really try to pay more attention to your higher-ups.\"\nHank’s eyes widened in disbelief as he processed the information. \"From the admiral’s family? That explains her incredible power. She truly is a credit to Admiral Kering’s lineage.\"\nAround them, people continued their praises, but Arix, still maintaining the psychic barrier, couldn’t hear any of it.\nIn just 20 minutes, her psychic power was almost depleted, leaving her with nothing but the harsh ringing in her ears and a mind clouded with pain.\nJust when Arix was about to give in, a powerful surge of psychic power forcefully merged with hers.\nRelieved that the seal held, she thought Cirilla had helped her, and she wanted to thank her.\nWhen Arix turned around, however, she saw a strange young man with silver hair standing behind her, looking at her intently.\n\"You are...?\" Arix hesitated, then ventured, \"Cassian’s elder brother?\"\nCassian let out a laugh and stared intently into Arix’s eyes, saying, \"Who do you think I am, Arix?\"\nArix blinked, taking a closer look at the handsome face in front of her. Then she suddenly realized something and blurt out, \"Cassian? How did you grow up?!\"\nCassian, satisfied, lightly tapped Arix’s forehead and said, \"This is my true form, Arix. Do you like it?\"\nHis silver hair reflected a soft sheen, and in sharp contrast were his bright, golden eyes, which were very piercing.\nHis thick, arched eyebrows and prominent nose exuded a masculine aggression, making it hard for Arix to connect him with the cute little boy she once knew.\nLastly, his red lips, like jelly, looked sweet and soft. His entire face displayed nobility and elegance.\nArix almost gawked. Blushing, she turned her head away and muttered softly, \"Yes, yes, got to admit he’s quite handsome.\"\nCassian’s smile deepened, his gaze softening as he looked at Arix.\nAdrian’s admiring followed Cassian from his strong, heroic entrance to the now increasingly sentimental atmosphere.\nHe looked somewhat bewildered and asked, \"Sis, did he come to rescue us, or is he here to romance Arix?\"\nCirilla, speechless, glared at her naive brother and smacked the back of his head. She then scolded, \"Shouldn’t you be more concerned about where this guy with Supergiant+ psychic power popped up from?\"\n\"Isn’t he just from our Alliance?\" Adrian rubbed the back of his head, feeling wronged.\n\"Really? You think the Alliance is just lucky like that? To have one Supergiant+ after another?\" Cirilla sighed, still trying to enlighten her only brother, and reminded him, \"Think about it, among all the galaxies, who else has silver hair, golden eyes, and Supergiant+ psychic power? Think carefully.\"\nAdrian pondered for a moment, then it struck him like a bolt of lightning. He trembled like a leaf and pointed at Cassian. His voice trembled as he asked, \"Sis... are you saying he is...\"\n\"OK, that’s enough, no need to say it out loud. Let’s pretend we don’t know,\" Cirilla quickly interrupted Adrian, not wanting to cause trouble for her family.\nAdrian swallowed, his curiosity itching like a cat scratching at him, but he couldn’t help asking, \"If Cassian is from the Empire, does that mean Arix might become his luna someday?\"\nAs soon as he said tat, Adrian felt some piercing glare.\nAdrian, looking up, realized it was his sister glaring at him. Cautiously, he asked, \"Sis, what did I say wrong now? The current royal family of the Empire are werewolves, right? They emphasize their own culture, calling the emperor ’alpha’ and the empress ’luna,’ right?\"\n\"You must be a spy sent by the Empire, my dear brother,\" Cirilla said, as if she were looking at a patient beyond cure.\nAs a member of the Alliance, the thought of marrying off the Alliance’s only Supergiant+ to the Empire made her consider severing ties with Adrian.\nAdrian looked even more confused.\nCirilla sighed, \"Adrian, my dear Adrian... God favored Arix so much that He gave Arix extra lucky and talent, yet you... my poor little thing, He must hate you so much that he totally muddled the creation.\"\nShe finally gave up on trying to cure her brother’s naivety. Now she realized why all the elders of the Rinn family opposed him becoming the family heir.",

      "content": "Chapter 27: Ether Crystal\nA wormhole appeared in the center of Hecaris City, and news of it spread terrifyingly fast across the entire Alliance.\nWhile all the people of the Alliance prayed for Hecaris, far away in the Empire, Duke Glendale also received the news.\n\"Oh, you’re saying a wormhole has appeared in the Alliance,\" Duke Glendale remarked. His expression wasn’t exactly gloating, but his tone was definitely a bit gleeful.\n\"Yes, Your Grace, we have a spy at the auction site; the information is absolutely accurate,\" confirmed Kasem, the Duke’s trusted butler.\nDuke Glendale’s smile grew wider as he feigned sympathy, \"Hecaris is where the Fifth Legion is stationed, and a wormhole appears right under their noses? This really isn’t going to look good to the people of the Alliance, Kasem. You know what to do, right?\"\n\"Understood, Your Grace. I will have our spy bribe the media to promote the Fifth Legion properly,\" Butler Kasem replied respectfully.\nAfter finishing his statement, Kasem turned to his opticomputer, located an account, and sent an encrypted message to the Alliance.\nDuke Glendale smiled contentedly. He elegantly picked up a cup of hand-ground coffee, and sipped it lightly, occasionally making a satisfied sound of appreciation.\nJust then, an irritating emergency alert sound came from Butler Kasem’s opticomputer.\nDuke Glendale frowned and gestured for Kasem to check the message.\nRespectfully nodding, Kasem accessed the opticomputer, and opened the urgent message.\n\"The crown prince has been found at the auction site in Hecaris. Need backup!\"\nThe content nearly made Kasem buckle at the knees.\n\"What is it about this message that’s so urgent? It must be interesting,\" Duke Glendale commented leisurely, taking another sip of his coffee.\n\"Duke, Prince Cassian is in Hecaris, at the auction site where the wormhole appeared,\" stammered Butler Kasem. His limbs trembled with fear and his voice quivering with disbelief.\n\"What the...\" Duke Glendale spit out his coffee. His movements was too hurried, and he even knocked over his coffee cup.\nAt that moment, Duke Glendale had no time to care about the spill. He urgently commanded, \"Hurry up, contact our embassy in the Alliance to protect the prince, hurry.\"\n\"Yes,\" Kasem replied. He steadied himself before quickly left the mansion to deliver the instructions to the embassy in the Empire.\nWhile he was alone, Duke Glendale thought for a moment and decided that, to make everything under his control, he had to make a trip to the Alliance himself.\nMeanwhile, in the Alliance, inside the auction hall...\n\"Arix, I’m here to save you!\" shouted Drexel. He was in a combat suit and rushing into the auction hall in a panic, his cries echoing wildly.\nHowever, when Drexel saw that Arix was unharmed, his cries suddenly stopped.\nDrexel stood there, still a bit stunned, and foolishly asked Arix, \"You’re okay, Arix?\"\nThe scenario didn’t match his expectations—wasn’t Arix supposed to be waiting for him like a sitting duck in distress?\nArix, sensing the curious gazes of the crowd, gave a wry smile and said, \"Why are you here?\"\n\"I came with Dad and some guys from the Fifth Legion; they’re right behind me. I was worried, so I rushed in,\" Drexel explained. After checking Arix from head to toe to make sure she was unharmed, he finally let out a sigh of relief.\nDrexel quietly observed Cassian. He was surprised to discover that this man would merge his psychic power with Arix’s—a level of trust that only come with deep connections.\n\"The Fifth Legion’s here,\" shouted a friend of Hank’s suddenly, drawing everyone’s attention towards the doorway.\nTwo rows of Alliance soldiers appeared, clad in deep blue uniforms and armed with rifles. They stood tall and formidable like solitary oaks on a mountain peak.\nThaddeus raised his left hand, and the well-trained troops stopped. He then approached the wormhole, accompanied only by a soldier holding a dark wooden box.\n\"Arix, Dad’s proud of you,\" Thaddeus said affectionately, patting his daughter’s head.\nHe then turned to Cassian, pausing before thanking him, \"Thank you for protecting the Alliance and Arix.\"\nCassian responded with a humble smile, \"No need for formalities, Admiral Kering.\"\nThaddeus nodded and then instructed towards the wormhole, \"Fergus, put it in.\"\n\"Yes,\" Fergus responded, then politely smiled at Arix and Cassian, \"You can both withdraw your psychic powers now.\"\nArix and Cassian exchanged a glance and nodded together.\nThe moment their psychic powers dissipated, Fergus opened the wooden box and swiftly threw a stone with anti-gravitational properties into the wormhole.\n\"Dad, what’s that?\" Arix asked curiously.\n\"The bane of wormholes, an Ether Crystal. You’ll learn about it at the military academy, but take a good look now; practical opportunities are rare,\" Thaddeus explained with a smile, patting his daughter’s head.\n\"Okay,\" Arix replied, her eyes fixed on the wormhole with the curiosity of a child.\nJust as the insectoids inside the wormhole thought their chance had arrived with the psychic barrier gone, they realized the wormhole was rapidly shrinking. In a matter of moments, the vast wormhole completely closed.\nAfter the wormhole disappeared, not only Thaddeus and his team breathed a sigh of relief, but everyone else also felt a massive weight lift from their shoulders.\n\"Now we can relax,\" said Hank, who had been tense the whole time. His relief was so profound that he fainted from the sudden release of stress.\nIt was only when Hank collapsed that his friend noticed a large gash across Hank’s abdomen.\nHank, dressed in black and deliberately hiding his injury, had prevented anyone from detecting anything amiss until now.\nHank’s friend carefully checked Hank’s pulse, relieved to find it still beating. And then, he also collapsed onto the ground, exhausted.\nNot just Hank, but many others in the hall were also severely injured. The sight of the Alliance soldiers seemed to have allowed them to finally let go of their burdens, resulting in many collapsing or fainting.\nThaddeus, deeply moved by the scene, solemnly removed his military cap and saluted everyone, \"All medical expenses for those here will be fully covered by my Fifth Legion. For those who tragically lost their lives in this disaster, I will request that they and their families receive the same treatment as martyrs and their widows. Additionally, on behalf of all the people of Hecaris in the Alliance, I thank you, heroes.\"\n\"When the people of the Alliance face trouble, it is our duty to help,\" cried Hank’s friend. He was supporting the unconscious Hank and wiping away tears as he led the chant.\n\"When the people of the Alliance face trouble, it is our duty to help,\" echoed the voices of those still awake in the hall, their declaration ringing loud and heartfelt.",

      "content": "Chapter 28: The Duke’s Confession\nThaddeus and the Fifth Legion had been guarding the auction house, and they only left after the medical staff arrived.\nThinking of Fleur, who was anxiously waiting at home, Drexel decided to follow Thaddeus.\nArix said goodbye to them and stayed behind to help the injured with Cirilla and Adrian. They didn’t stop until the medics had taken all the injured away.\n\"Arix, our butler has come to take me and my brother. We’re leaving now, but I’ll see you at military training the day after tomorrow,\" Cirilla said after checking a message on her opticomputer.\n\"Okay, see you then,\" Arix replied, smiling and waving.\nAfter Cirilla and Adrian left, Arix realized she was alone with Cassian, which made her feel a bit nervous.\n\"Arix, why won’t you look at me?\" Cassian asked, trying to appear innocent.\n\"It’s nothing... I’m just not used to you growing up so fast,\" Arix replied, turning away in embarrassment.\nArix had always been drawn to beauty. When she was eight, she would often follow handsome boys, worrying her family until the boys had to call the police to bring her back.\nHer fixation on looks caused trouble, and the elders tried to cure her by making her look at pictures of handsome men for a month.\nAt first, Arix enjoyed it, but she soon grew tired and eventually nauseated, begging for the ordeal to end.\nThe elders thought they had cured her, but they had only made her more selective.\nCassian raised an eyebrow and leaned closer, his voice husky, \"Arix, don’t you like that I’ve grown up?\"\nHis expression and his handsome face overwhelmed Arix, making her feel breathless.\nCassian laughed upon seeing her react, and Arix, confused, touched her nose. She noticed a hint of crimson on her fingertips.\n...\n\"Ow!\" Arix howled, turning away to quickly pull a handkerchief from her spatial button to wipe the blood.\nThough she cleaned the blood, she felt a deeper stain on her soul.\nShe knew the blood was from the recent fight, but Cassian might have thought it was excitement that caused her nosebleed.\nEmbarrassed by the thought, Arix stubbornly kept her back to him, refusing to turn around.\nCassian watched her with a hint of amusement in his eyes. He was about to continue teasing when he was interrupted by shouting from the entrance.\n\"Prince Cassian, Your Highness!\" A middle-aged man called out loudly from the corridor of the auction hall.\nArix breathed a sigh of relief and moved further away.\nCassian turned to see Duke Glendale rushing into the hall.\nUpon seeing Cassian unharmed, the Duke joyously clung to his legs, wailing, \"Your Highness, I’ve found you at last. You have no idea how hard this past month has been for me. I couldn’t eat or sleep, thinking you might be suffering, my heart felt as if it were being sliced.\"\nKasem, the butler, arrived with the Empire’s legion shortly after. He bowed his head, struggling to suppress a smirk at the Duke’s dramatics. Although the Duke claimed hardship, he had continued to indulge in fine wines and foods, even entertaining a bevy of beauties the previous night.\nDespite his disdain, Cassian noticed the genuine fatigue marked by dark circles under the Duke’s eyes. Feeling a pang of sympathy, he sighed, \"I understand, you’ve had a hard time this month. Please wait outside for me, and do not come in without my permission.\"\nDuke Glendale ceased his wailing. He rose and gave Arix a knowing look. Then he puffed up his chest and promised, \"Your Highness, rest assured, I won’t let anyone in.\"\nAfter casting a meaningful glance and a sly smile at Cassian and Arix, Duke Glendale left the hall with Kasem.\nThe hall fell silent until Cassian gathered his courage to speak. \"Arix...\"\n\"Cassian, you’re leaving, aren’t you?\" Arix, already aware, stopped pretending and asked casually.\nCassian remained silent for a moment before nodding. \"Yes.\"\n\"When are you leaving?\" Arix asked, her voice tinged with sadness as she hung her head.\nWhen Arix felt her loneliest, Cassian had entered her life. His presence over the past month had helped her adjust to her new circumstances.\nIt seemed she had rescued Cassian, but in reality, his arrival had given her strength. Even though she had always known they would have to part ways because Cassian was a therian from the Empire, she was still unprepared when the moment actually arrived.\nCassian noticed Arix’s unusual sadness and sighed. He gently pulled her into his arms to offer comfort. Feeling his tender touch, Arix’s eyes immediately filled with tears.\nAfter a moment, Arix asked softly, \"Will you come back?\"\nCassian paused before replying with certainty, \"I will, Arix.\"\n\"Will you be in danger in the Empire?\" she asked, her concern palpable.\nLooking into her clear, sky-like eyes, Cassian felt a stir in his heart. He reached out to touch the corner of her eye gently and reassured her, \"Don’t worry, I’m safe in the Empire.\"\n\"That’s right, you’re the only prince of the Empire,\" Arix said, her voice tinged with desolation. She realized Cassian no longer needed her protection.\nCassian did not elaborate on his safety but smiled and released Arix, looking at her reluctantly. \"Arix, I have to go.\"\nArix watched him silently for a long time before finally nodding and advising, \"Okay, here’s my opticomputer number, make sure to contact me once you’re in the Empire.\"\n\"Alright, I’ll remember, Arix. But I have take you home first, then I’ll go,\" Cassian insisted, not wanting her to go home alone.\nHe took her hand and walked her out, only departing for the starship after ensuring she was safely back at the Kering family’s place.\nArix leaned quietly against the door after he left, remaining there until the outside was silent.\nThen, she walked back inside, feeling a bit lost.\nIt was late at night, and Arix felt bored. She lay by the bedroom window, occasionally checking her opticomputer.\nAfter a sigh, she dropped her arm again.\n\"Why hasn’t he contacted me yet?\" Arix muttered, slightly annoyed.\nIt had been 10 hours since Cassian returned to the Empire. Yet, apart from the occasional ad pop-up on her opticomputer, there were no friend requests.\nDing!\n\"You have a new friend request.\"\nArix’s mood instantly brightened, and she tapped on her opticomputer with a smile. On a 3D virtual screen, she quickly accepted the new request.\nSuddenly, a puppy avatar appeared among her opticomputer friends. Seeing this avatar, Arix laughed—it was Cassian as a child.\nDing!\n\"Your friend Cassian is requesting a video call.\"\nArix accepted, and Cassian’s upper body, clad in a golden robe, appeared on the 3D virtual screen.\n\"Arix, I’ve arrived home,\" he said, his voice warm.\nArix’s ears tingled at his voice. \"Yeah, I know. Why did you contact me so late?\" she asked, feigning indifference.\nCassian instantly recognized her act. Arix was just being like a child.\nHe sighed. If Arix were here, he’d probably pinch her nose for so naughty.\n\"Arix, I’ve missed you,\" Cassian finally admitted. His voice booming, make Arix’s ear itch.\nArix’s face turned red instantly, and in a fluster, she aimed the virtual screen at the ceiling, too embarrassed to let Cassian see her anymore.\nSo handsome, and with such a great voice, Cassian was tempting her to commit a crime!\nCassian, noticing the screen now facing the wall, couldn’t help laughing. He looked at the clock—it was 11 PM—and smiled at Arix through the opticomputer, \"Arix, it’s late. You should go to sleep.\"\n\"Mm, goodnight, Cassian,\" Arix said sweetly, and then she quickly ended the video call.\nCassian was about to say more, but the screen went dark. He laughed, both disappointed and amused, \"She just hung up like that? Not even a goodbye.\"\nThat night, Arix slept soundly and even had a beautiful dream.\nIn the dream, she walked hand in hand with a handsome man whose face she couldn’t see, along a beach under a clear blue sky with a gentle breeze.\nAs they walked, their mood heated up. Arix and the handsome man gazed into each other’s eyes and slowly closed their eyes, about to kiss.\nJust then, thunder boomed in the sky, waking Arix with its deafening sound.\nBang! Bang Bang!\nDrexel’s loud banging and shouting echoed through the bedroom door,\" Arix, are you up yet? The military training starts tomorrow, hurry up and come with me to the mall to buy some supplies.\"\nStartled from her sleep, Arix grasped for breath. Remembering her near-kiss with the Prince Charming in her dream, she grabbed a pillow and hurled it at the door, yelling, \"Drexel! I swear I’m having a heart attack!\"\n\"Arix, the sun is already up; how will you handle military training being so lazy?\" Drexel sighed dramatically.\n\"Get lost!!\" Arix roared.\n\"Alright, I’ll wait for you downstairs.\" Feeling it unsafe to linger, Drexel quickly retreated.\nIn her bedroom, Arix glanced at the time on her opticomputer—it was only 8 AM. Frustrated by her interrupted dream, she bit her blanket. After calming down, she set the blanket aside and got up to wash and dress.\nAs soon as Drexel reached the bottom of the stairs, Fleur grabbed his collar and scolded him, \"I told you to wake her up, not give her a shock. Why did you have to knock so loudly?\"\n\"I get woken up the same way by Kellan; why don’t you scold him?\" Drexel complained.\nKellan rolled his eyes, \"You stay up all night playing games. If we don’t knock loudly, how would you ever wake up?\"\nDrexel’s nightlife was all about gaming till dawn, and he slept like a log during the day.\nHonestly, Kellan hated having to wake him up.\nThinking about the upcoming military training, where all electronic devices had to be handed in, Kellan looked at Drexel with a smirk.\nOut of arguments, Drexel weakly said, \"Mom, I’m sorry. I’ll be gentler next time.\"\nFleur was about to lecture more but stopped when she saw Arix coming downstairs. She let Drexel off with a warning, \"If I catch you doing this again, I’ll cut your allowance.\"\nTurning to Arix, Fleur said gently, \"Arix, are you awake? Have some breakfast, then we’ll go shopping.\"\n\"Mm, thanks, Mom,\" Arix replied with a sleepy yet sweet hoarseness.\nDrexel, observing the blatant double standards, muttered to Kellan, \"Look at Mom, she’s so harsh with us but so gentle with Arix.\"\nKellan blinked and seriously said to Drexel, \"Drexel, I think you can remove ’us.’ Mom has never been harsh with me either.\"\nDrexel paused to think for a moment, then was speechless. It seemed Fleur really was only harsh with him. With a look of betrayal, he glared at Kellan.\nWith a snort, he started eating. Seeing him finally quiet down, Kellan felt the air freshen around him. He began eating in a good mood.",

      "content": "Chapter 29: Making the Headlines\nThey finished the meal in a good mood. Just as Arix was about to leave, Fleur stopped her.\nAfter transferring a large sum of money into her account, Fleur finally pushed her out the door.\n\"Just go. Buy yourself something nice.\"\nDrexel was waiting by the door to drive Arix. Seeing this, his eyes turned green with envy.\nHe raised his hand to check his bank account on his opticomputer. His balance showed only 100,000 astrocredits, which Fleur had just transferred to him.\nDrexel suddenly felt a chill in his heart.\nHis eyes quickly darted around, and then, trying to butter Arix up, he said, \"Arix, do you have so much money you can’t even spend it all? Maybe I can help you spend some?\"\nArix raised an eyebrow. Although she really couldn’t spend all that money, she wouldn’t complain about having too much—no one would.\nJust at that moment, Arix remembered her potion shop on the interstellarnet, which really could use someone to help manage it.\nOver the past month, besides reading beginner’s books on mechas, Arix had also been learning about potions. She had made a bunch of potions below Planet Class.\nTo make space, Arix had put them up in her online store, and actually sold quite a few.\nBut what bothered Arix the most each time she sold potions was handling the sales and packing the parcels. She thought if someone could take care of these chores, it wouldn’t be too bad. And since Drexel was her brother, he was definitely trustworthy.\nThinking this, Arix looked at Drexel.\nFeeling her stare, Drexel got a bit nervous until she spoke, \"How about a job? Manage my online store, mainly handle sales and shipping, I’ll pay you 5 million a month, or you can take 10% of the profits.\"\n\"Of course!\" Drexel immediately agreed without hesitation. But then something occurred to him, and he cautiously asked, \"Arix, when did you start an online store? It’s legit business, right?\"\n\"It’s a potion store,\" Arix said with a resigned roll of her eyes.\nOnly then did Drexel remember. Arix’s talent for potions was indeed impressive. He had seen her make insecticide potions before, and they were quite astonishing.\n\"Tsk tsk tsk! That’s my sister,\" Drexel said, giving her a thumbs up.\n\"So, do you choose 5 million, or 10% of the profits?\" Arix asked, raising an eyebrow.\n\"I’m not dumb, of course. I’ll take the 10% share. Heh, does that make me your partner too?\" Drexel, never having been in a real business before, laughed excitedly.\n\"Yeah, I’m the big boss, and you’re my right hand. When we get home, I’ll log into the Connective Pod and give you authorities.\"\nFinding someone to manage her store made Arix quite happy. Now she could focus on studying potions and mechas.\n\"Alright, let’s hurry up so we can come back early.\" Drexel courteously opened the car door for her, helping Arix into the car first.\nThen he sat in the driver’s seat, started the Lev, and sped off toward the mall.\nTwenty minutes later, Drexel parked the Lev at the designated spot and then led Arix into the mall, named the Lasair’s.\n\"What are we looking for?\" Arix asked Drexel. She wasn’t very familiar with what to prepare for military trainings in this world.\nDrexel opened his chat history with Varden and started listing items, \"I know this! I asked Varden before coming. He said we need to get face wash, shower gel, fresh towels, sunscreen...\"\nAs Arix listened, she realized these were all familiar items. She felt a bit sentimental that the items for interstellar military training were no different from a regular camping trip.\nThe two found a department store. As soon as they entered, they noticed many military students, apparently also preparing for training.\nThe store was full of high-tech items that quickly caught Arix’s attention. Excited, she pulled Drexel around the store, exploring here and there.\nWhile they were shopping, many military academy students recognized Drexel and Arix. After all, Arix was among the top ten new students, and Drexel was a notable figure from the Hecaris Military Academy.\n\"Look, it’s Drexel Kering and Arix Thalis! Why are they shopping together? Oh my gosh, are they seeing each other?\" one student thought he had discovered big news. He quickly took a sneaky photo of them being close together and uploaded it to the Interstellarnet Headlines.\n\"I always felt there was something special between them. It’s confirmed, confirmed! If they’re not a couple, I’ll eat noodles with my nose,\" another girl whispered excitedly.\nHer friend, with a dreamy expression, added, \"A wealthy heir and an orphan from Planet Waste, what a perfect match. Tell the court, I’ve ruled, they must marry soon.\"\nSomeone behind them protested unhappily, \"Arix is just an orphan from Planet Waste; she’s not worthy of Drexel. Please stop making random matches; only a lady like Cirilla is suitable for him.\"\nThe self-declared \"judge\" disdainfully retorted, \"Look at your face, it’s all twisted with jealousy. Even if Arix comes from a humble background, she’s among the top ten newcomers. If you were that impressive, my ruling might favor you too.\"\nMeanwhile, Arix kept sneezing. Drexel looked over with concern, \"Are you catching a cold? Should we buy some medicine?\"\nArix sniffed and frowned, \"No cold, but I feel like someone is cursing me.\"\n\"Arix, we’re in the age of science now. How can you still believe in such superstitions?\" Drexel said, chuckling as he playfully ruffled her hair.\nHowever, after Drexel ruffled her hair, Arix felt her symptoms worsen a bit.\nArix shivered slightly. Now uncertain if she might actually have a cold, she said to Drexel, \"Let’s finish shopping and head back.\"\n\"Okay, we just need to get sunscreen. Let’s grab that and go. You head to the checkout and wait for me,\" Drexel replied, also showing concern for Arix. He hurried off toward the sunscreen display.\nDing!\n\"You have a message from Cassian.\"\nJust as Arix reached the checkout, her opticomputer chimed with a notification.\nHearing it was from Cassian, Arix smiled slightly and opened the message on her opticomputer. A photo of her and Drexel together popped up in the conversation.\nArix was puzzled for a moment and sent a question mark in response. Then she started typing, \"What does this mean? Drexel and I are just shopping. How do you have our photo?\"\n\"Arix, check out the top news on interstellarnet. You’re in for a surprise,\" the message read.\nFeeling confused, Arix logged onto the Interstellarnet Headlines. The headline that greeted her nearly made her blood boil.\nShock! Drexel Kering’s Girlfriend Revealed?!\nHow Arix Thalis Captured the Heart of a Wealthy Heir! Insights from Love Experts.\nHow Cinderella Pulled Off a Real-Life Fairytale!

      "content": "Chapter 30: A Hipster\nThe Kering family hadn’t told the public about Arix’s identity before, because they feared it would put her in danger. The Kering family’s daughter, the only Supergiant+ in the Alliance—these two identities would make all the powers of the galaxy want to get her.\nSo, in the eyes of most people in the Alliance, Arix was still that girl from Planet Waste, Arix Thalis.\nAt the family banquet of the Kering family, only the top families of the Alliance were present. They might know Arix’s true identity, but in terms of her true power, the Kering family only claimed she was a Supergiant.\nThe five noble families knew Arix’s real strength, but they understood the Kering family’s concerns. Therefore, they also kept silent in agreement.\nSo, Arix never expected that one day she would become famous because of a scandal with her own brother.\nArix was both annoyed and amused. She scrolled down the virtual screen for a while, seeing almost all the photos of her and Drexel playfully fighting in the shop.\nEach photo captured a special closeness. Those images, coupled with suggestive texts, almost made her believe them if she weren’t the person involved.\n\"Orphan girl from Planet Waste and the grandson of Admiral Kering\"—this sensational story had topped the hot search of the entire interstellarnet within just half an hour.\n\"You have a message from Cassian.\"\nArix hadn’t even opened the message, but she knew Cassian must be laughing at her on the other end.\n\"How about that, Arix, surprised?\"\nArix quickly replied, feeling itchy with irritation, \"Noooooo!\"\n\"Haha, aren’t you starting military training tomorrow? Remember to contact me over the weekend.\"\n\"Then you should work harder to win my calls. Got to go, Drexel is here.\"\nNot far away, Drexel was approaching fast, sparks flying. When he saw Arix close her opticomputer, he curiously asked, \"Arix, who were you chatting with?\"\n\"Cirilla asking me what to buy for military training; I just replied to her,\" Arix fibbed.\nShe didn’t want Drexel to know she was chatting with Cassian. These two were like cat and mouse in a past life, naturally at odds.\n\"Oh, then go wait for me in the car, I’ll come after I pay.\"\nDrexel just asked casually. He didn’t suspect anything and after giving his instructions, he went to queue up at the checkout.\nArix breathed a sigh of relief and went back to wait in the car.\nBefore long, Drexel, carrying several bags, put them in the trunk. He seemed quite pleased with himself. As he sat in the driver’s seat, he said, \"Arix, do you think I looked cooler today? A lot of people in the supermarket were secretly watching me.\"\nAfter saying that, Drexel even flirtatiously flicked his hair in the car mirror.\nSpeechless, Arix didn’t know what to say and finally covered her face and said, \"Dude, maybe you should check the Interstellarnet Headlines.\"\nDrexel looked at Arix, surprised. Then he suddenly turned excited and exclaimed, \"Even the headlines are discussing how cool I am? I need to check this out.\"\nArix hesitated to speak. The story had already blown up; Drexel would find out sooner or later.\nSo, she decided not to respond, just silently shut her mouth.\nDrexel, his eyes wide with anticipation, turned on his opticomputer. However, as soon as he opened the news, his smile froze. His eyebrows furrowed deeply, and his face grew darker by the second.\nArix, watching Drexel’s reaction, nervously swallowed. She cautiously said, \"Drexel... maybe we shouldn’t look. It’s all baseless rumors, it’s upsetting. Right?\"\n\"No, part of them are true,\" Drexel said seriously.\nArix, visibly shocked, stuttered, \"So you think... No... this isn’t right, we are siblings, it’s not supposed to be like this!\"\n\"Arix, face the reality. They’re right, and it is true that I’m way out of your league. I’m just too cool to be with you,\" Drexel smirked arrogantly and even proudly tilted his chin up.\nArix’s fists clenched. She looked at Drexel with a dangerous glint in her eyes and said, \"Is that all you took from reading this long?\"\n\"What else is there? Isn’t it all about how you’re not good enough for me? I think it makes sense,\" Drexel dangerously continued.\nArix, unable to hold back her irritation, scoffed coldly, \"Since you’re so great, it’s a shame to have you work for me in my store. I might as well talk to Kellan about it.\"\nOnly then did Drexel let out a wail, hastily admitting his mistake, \"Arix! I was just joking. I’m sorry, okay?\"\nArix then grunted in satisfaction.\nDrexel didn’t dare say more. He sat like a wronged baby girl.\nSoon after, they boarded the Lev and returned to the Kering family.\nOnce back at the Kering family, Drexel, as if on fire, dragged Arix onto the interstellarnet.\n\"Welcome to the Interstellarnet.\"\nAs their psychic powers connected to the interstellarnet, a familiar, gentle female voice rang in their ears.\nArix and Drexel appeared together on the bustling streets of the interstellarnet for the first time. Seeing each other’s avatars, both made faces of disgust.\nDrexel merely disliked Arix’s unisex attires, and he thought she was not girly enough. Arix felt that Drexel’s outfit was an assault on her eyes.\n\"Drexel, what on earth are you wearing?\" If Arix didn’t know they were in the interstellar, she might have thought it was a hippie revival.\nDrexel was in an explosive hairstyle, colorful attire, and smoky makeup that looked half-dead. He wore a rainbow undershirt with a blue Mack shirt. Worst of all, his pants were bright pink.\n\"Ouch, my eyes, my eyes!\" Arix cried out in mock agony.\nDrexel strutted around like a proud rooster, constantly flaunting what he believed to be the most unique parts of his outfit in front of Arix. \"Hmph, you country bumpkin. This style was once the trendiest thing in the ancient times.\"\n\"If it is that trendy, why haven’t I seen you wear this offline?\" Arix asked curiously, covering her eyes.\nDrexel’s smile stiffened. He was too embarrassed to reveal the truth, so he quickly changed the subject. \"Let’s take care of the shop first. We need to get up early tomorrow for trainings. Let’s finish this and then rest early.\"\n\"Alright then,\" Arix replied as she opened the shop’s control panel. She clicked on the shop option in her personal information, took Drexel to the shop, and gave him the highest administration authority. With that, she handed over the entire potion shop to Drexel to manage.\nThen, she logged off to video call Cassian.\nAfter all, tonight was their last chance for a while, as all electronic devices for military freshmen would be surrendered for a month. They’d only get them back on weekends. It would be much harder to stay in touch after tonight.",

      "content": "Chapter 31: The Training Begins\nThe next morning, Arix washed up and casually turned on her opticomputer.\nThe sound of coins being deposited echoed one after another.\n\"Your account has received 50,000 astrocredits, from your store.\"\n\"Your account has received 80,000 astrocredits, from your store.\"\n\"Your account has received 5,000 astrocredits, from your store.\"\nThen Arix remembered that she had handed over her potion online store to Drexel the day before, but this endless list of transactions...\n’He didn’t stay up all night, did he?’\nshe wondered, frowning.\nShe left her bedroom with a serious look on her face. When she reached the living room, she saw Drexel already eating breakfast.\n\"You’re awake! How about it? Did you see?\" Drexel asked, excitedly raising his eyebrows.\n\"Don’t tell me you stayed up all night,\" Arix said, sounding slightly upset.\nShe didn’t want Drexel spending too much time on the online store. It could distract him from his studies.\nDrexel grinned proudly and then pulled a miniature delivery robot from his Space Button.\n\"Is this a delivery robot?!\" Arix first looked at the small robot in surprise, and it took her a moment to grasp Drexel’s point.\nThen Arix felt a bit stupid. She had been too busy recently, her mind always muddled. She had been packing and shipping for a month and hadn’t even thought of using a delivery robot.\n\"Arix, could I get my share of the profits from yesterday? I bought this robot and still owe a good buddy over 800,000 astrocredits,\" Drexel asked shyly—a rare sight for someone usually so bold.\n\"Sure.\" Arix was speechless at her own foolishness, but she firmly transferred 5 million astrocredits to Drexel.\nUpon hearing his account had received 5 million, Drexel immediately smiled broadly. \"Haha, Arix, go ahead and have your breakfast. I’ll wait for you in the car.\"\n\"Okay, I’ll be right there,\" Arix said, her mood gloomy.\nAfter breakfast, their driver took them to the entrance of the Hecaris Military Academy.\nAfter getting out of the car, Arix told the driver to be safe. Then she and Drexel entered the school together and went to the training ground to wait for assembly.\nMany new students who had already arrived at the training ground started whispering to each other upon seeing Arix and Drexel.\n\"Hey, look, it’s Arix and Drexel.\"\n\"She’s not as bad as they say online, I think they look quite good together.\"\n\"Exactly. In this year’s exam, Arix is the only one from our academy in the top ten of the whole Alliance. The others are just jealous.\"\n\"It’s a shame about her background, though. It would be great if she came from a better one.\"\nDrexel leaned closer to Arix and whispered, \"Arix, are you sure you don’t want to explain now? I’m so handsome, some crazy fan might go after you.\"\n\"The military training has already started; we can announce it after it’s over. It’s better to explain when everyone is together, otherwise, it’s too much trouble to explain to each person separately,\" Arix said nonchalantly.\nDrexel raised an eyebrow and grinned, \"Okay, that works. It’ll help me block some of the admirers. After all, girls only get in my brain and slow down my mecha driving.\"\n\"Any girl who gets in your brain is terribly unlucky,\" Arix rolled her eyes at Drexel’s narcissistic comment.\n\"Wow, look, a warship!\"\nAs someone shouted in surprise, a huge black warship appeared in the sky. It quickly cut through the clouds and stopped in front of the training ground.\nThe shape of the warship was somewhat like the luxury cruise ships Arix had seen in her last life. However, she knew there was no comparison: a cruise ship was for sightseeing and could sink at any moment under wind and waves; this one was built for battle, capable of withstanding attacks from the most advanced weapons.\nThe freshmen waited for a while until four people slowly walked out from the middle of the warship’s deck.\nThe first was President Gunder of the Hecaris Military Academy; the other three, dressed in dark blue uniforms with golden trim, were new to the students.\n\"Hello, everyone, I am President Gunder. We will be conducting a month-long military training. The three instructors behind me will score you based on your performance during the training. After the training, they will sort you into classes based on your scores. I believe every student wants to be in the best class.\"\nAlthough Gunder’s expression was kind and gentle, his tone was firm and commanding.\n\"Yes!\" all the new students shouted together.\n\"Then show your best! Now, all students, board the warship,\" Gunder said with a satisfied smile.\nGunder gestured with his hand from back to front, and the instructor immediately activated a program on the opticomputer.\nInstantly, a boarding ladder unfolded segment by segment, reaching out to the training ground.\nAll the new students of the Hecaris Military Academy watched the warship in awe, then they orderly boarded the ship one after another.\nAfter confirming all the new students had boarded, Gunder spoke again, \"To protect the location of the Fifth Legion base, you need to hand over your opticomputers and Space Buttons. During this time, the school will assign you a digital bracelet numbered from 1 to 1000. The bracelet will record your number and score. During military training, it is strictly forbidden to hide any electronic devices or anything unrelated to the military. Violators will be severely punished and a record of the violation will be left in their files.\"\nThe new students murmured their dissatisfaction, but almost all of them obediently handed over their opticomputers and Space Buttons to the instructors. They then received the black iron-colored bracelets from the instructors.\nThe students, having surrendered their opticomputers and Space Buttons, looked at the instructors with mournful expressions, as if they had just lost their boyfriend or girlfriend.\nThe instructors ignored these looks. They ruthlessly carried two large bags and approached the next student.\nWhen it was Arix’s turn, she had already removed her opticomputer and Space Button. She handed them over to the instructor voluntarily, so the instructor nodded at Arix with a smile.\nHowever, the situation took a turn when it came to Drexel next door. Arix turned to look and saw Drexel and an instructor pulling on the opticomputer as if they were in a tug-of-war.\n\"Let go!\" The instructor’s veins bulged from the effort. He didn’t want to be mocked by other instructors, so he kept up the struggle with Drexel.\nDrexel said nothing, but his eyes, almost tearful, vividly expressed his extreme reluctance.\nAt this point, several other students sneakily watched Drexel and the instructor. Seeing the situation escalating, Arix couldn’t help but facepalm.\nThen, she quickly kicked Drexel behind the knees, causing him enough pain to release his grip.\nThe instructor breathed a sigh of relief and quickly put the opticomputer into the bag. He moved faster than before as he went on to the next student.\nSeeing that the spectacle was over, the surrounding new students turned their attention away. Drexel looked completely deflated, like a frosted eggplant.\nArix knew how severe Drexel’s gaming addiction was and how painful it was for him to be separated from his opticomputer. She patted Drexel’s hair, offering silent comfort.",

      "content": "Chapter 32: The Instructors\nThe three instructors collected everyone’s opticomputers and Space Buttons into a bag. Then they stood next to Gunder and nodded at him.\nAfter receiving the signal from the instructors, Gunder smiled with satisfaction. He looked back at the newcomers and praised, \"Good, everyone is acting cooperatively. The next part of your journey will be with the instructors. Please welcome the three instructors now.\"\nThe students clapped respectfully.\nThe highest-ranking instructor among them, a lieutenant, stepped forward amid the applause. His handsome, youthful face, coupled with his impressive physique, caught the eyes of many girls. Some bold ones even started whispering among themselves.\nThe guy, Ortiz, after he positioned himself, made a silencing gesture to the students. Once the students quieted down, he spoke out loudly, \"Hello, everyone, I am your chief instructor, Ortiz. On my left is my vice, Bauer. On my right is instructor Virtanen.\"\nBauer was a typical military man. His ordinary features, weathered by experience, gave off a rugged charm. The uniform added an indescribable sense of integrity to him. It felt like safety, as if having him around meant having someone to take on the world for you.\nInstructor Virtanen was the one who had been \"tug-of-warring\" with Drexel earlier. He was thin and carried an air of a scholar about him. He seemed a bit shy as well. He now stood behind Ortiz, secretly sizing up each student.\nAfter introducing his partners, Ortiz continued, \"First, on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the Fifth Legion, I welcome the students training at the Hecaris Military Academy. Since you’ve chosen the military academy, I assume you are ready to bravely forge yourselves, face hardships, and strengthen your resolve, right?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" the newcomers responded weakly, intimidated by the thought of the grueling month ahead.\n\"You haven’t started to suffer yet, but let me make it clear—you know what you are enduring this for? It’s so that later you can protect the people from the insectoids and defend the Alliance! Now tell me, can you do it? Louder!\" Ortiz shouted loudly.\n\"Yes, sir!\" The newcomers’ spirits were ignited. Like newborn wolf pups, they puffed up their chests, and they shouted with flushed faces.\n\"Good, now everyone go back to your cabins to rest and wait for further instructions. Also, the number on your room corresponds to the number on your bracelet. If you have any questions, you can ask the robot butler in your room. Dismissed!\" Ortiz instructed.\nAfter watching the students enter their cabins, he turned to Gunder with a look of deep respect.\n\"Ortiz, you are getting better at this,\" Gunder said warmly to the trio, his eyes carrying a hint of nostalgia.\nHe clearly remembered how these three had once stood here receiving his own lectures. They too had been timid kids, terrified of the insectoids. Gunder was now proud as he saw them as capable soldiers able to stand on their own.\n\"Sir, you flatter us,\" Ortiz responded modestly, but his face couldn’t hide a trace of excitement.\n\"Sir, just speak your mind, what’s there that we can’t discuss?\" Bauer, the oldest of the trio and more worldly-wise, was the first to sense that Gunder had something more to say.\nGunder, his thoughts exposed, decided not to beat around the bush anymore. \"This batch of newcomers includes a girl named Arix. Keep a close eye on her.\"\n\"Is there a problem with her? Is she a spy sent by the Empire’s warmongers?\" Ortiz asked sharply.\nGunder, who treated Arix as if she were a priceless treasure, was annoyed by Ortiz’s assumption and knocked him on the forehead. Then scolding Ortiz, he said, \"Let me finish! You start guessing before I’ve even explained. Let me tell you, not only is Arix’s background impeccable, but she is also of great importance to the Alliance.\"\n\"So what do we do?\" Ortiz, rubbing his head and not daring to interrupt further, asked meekly.\n\"I want you to elevate her physical power to Star Class before training ends,\" Gunder said firmly, his eyes serious.\n\"Isn’t that asking too much of the girl?\" Virtanen, who had access to the recruits’ data, had just reviewed Arix’s profile and knew her current level was only Planet Class.\nThe idea of boosting Arix’s physical power to jump a whole class in just one month was almost absurd. If anyone other than Gunder had suggested this, Virtanen might have laughed it off.\nOrdinarily, even the diligent need at least three years of training to possibly break through. Even with shortcuts, like using a Star-Class booster, it would still require at least three months of training to be effective.\nAfter all, using a Star-Class booster wouldn’t be as straightforward as the lower-class boosters, where you might experience a breakthrough just by consuming one.\nTo break through to Star-Class and above, even with a potion, one still needs to combine it with extensive training to stand a chance.\nBoosters below Planet Class force a breakthrough. Boosters for Star-Class and above, however, are primarily for assistance.\nMost people only use them when they are on the brink of advancing to the next level, to reduce the risk of failure.\n\"Sir, may I ask why?\" Bauer looked directly at Gunder. He knew Gunder was a dependable person. If he spoke so, there likely were hidden complexities regarding Arix.\nGunder wasn’t one to hide things unnecessarily. He shared what he could, \"Arix’s psychic power is incredibly strong, but her physical condition is at the other extreme. If she hadn’t taken a Planet-Class Booster before, she might now only be able to survive in a healing pod, or worse, she might not have survived at all.\"\nGiven the life-threatening stakes for the student, the three instructors nodded solemnly. \"Rest assured, we know what to do.\"\n\"Alright, no need to be so tense. Things aren’t as bad as they seem. Arix has been nurtured this month with all sorts of rare treasures by her parents, and she’s almost reaching Star-Class. She just lacks an opportunity, and that’s where you come in. I can’t help any further, I’ll be leaving now,\" said Gunder. After his words, he stepped onto the boarding ladder and returned to the Hecaris Military Academy.\nAfter Gunder had left, Ortiz and the others discussed among themselves for a while. They finally made a decision together before returning to their own cabins.",

      "content": "Chapter 33: The Sisters\nThe warship travelled very fast. In less than an hour, the students arrived at the Fifth Legion’s base.\nAs they disembarked from the warship, they realized that their training location was not at the base of the Fifth Legion but in a smaller base next to it. There was a 20-meter-high wall separating the two bases.\nStanding at the training base, the students’ view was blocked by the wall. Yet, from time to time, they could still see mechas and destroyers assembling in the sky above, then majestically flying out from the legion base.\nEven though the students could only watch these awe-inspiring scenes from afar, they were thrilled enough to scream and cheer.\nArix was among one of the excited students. She clutched Drexel’s arm and shouted, \"Look, that’s a Star-Class mecha, isn’t it? It’s just as cool as I imagined.\"\n\"It’s okay,\" Drexel replied, his eyes filled with envy. \"You haven’t seen Grandfather’s Supergiant-Class mecha, right? It’s named Mercury. That’s really something.\"\n\"Supergiant-Class mecha? I’ve heard that mechas of this class might eventually evolve into legendary mechanical beings called Omnic. Legends say they have nearly godlike powers,\" Arix said, her eyes sparkling with excitement.\n\"That’s just a legend, after all. So far, I’ve never actually seen any mecha turn into a mechanical being,\" Drexel said dismissively.\n\"Humph, I think I’ll definitely be able to create a god-level mecha with a mechanical life someday,\" Arix retorted with high spirits.\n\"Being confident is good, but being overconfident can lead to your downfall. Take it easy, we’re not like the villains on TV with absurd talents,\" Drexel said, not believing her one bit. He couldn’t help but lecture Arix, feeling she was almost boasting too much.\nArix rolled her eyes and huffed. Seeing that everyone had already disembarked from the warship and gathered, she didn’t want to say more, so she stopped paying attention to Drexel.\n\"Meet at the training field at 8 AM tomorrow, and you have free time today. As usual, based on your numbers, find your dorms. Six people per room. As for the dorm leader, you can recommend someone and report it to Virtanen tomorrow. I now declare you dismissed,\" Ortiz instructed after everyone had gathered.\nThen he and Bauer turned and left.\nAfter the instructors left, other new students who had arrived at the base earlier boldly approached to find people they knew from before.\nTwo pretty girls approached Drexel.\nWatching the sisters in front of her, Arix raised an eyebrow. She watched the trio with a gossip-hungry gaze, and then she especially took a few good looks at Drexel, eagerly anticipating some drama.\n\"Drexel, did you really get a girlfriend?\" asked Azura, one of the two girls, blinked her eyes cutely.\nThe girl next to Azura didn’t speak, but her eyes were curious. She seemed nervously intrigued as she looked at Drexel.\nHer name was Calista. She had been kidnapped by traffickers ten years ago. During the three days she was held captive, she witnessed the tragic fates of many girls.\nThe traffickers wanted to sell her for a good price, so they didn’t harm her to avoid leaving scars. Otherwise, she would have suffered the nightmare torment like the other girls.\nIn that hell, she waited desperately for three days. Just when she was about to be sold and had resolved to end her own life, someone burst into the room, interrupting her as she was about to commit suicide with a shard of glass.\nInitially, Calista numbly looked up when she heard the door being smashed open. But soon, she realized that the intruder was just a boy not much older than her. A spark of hope flashed in her eyes, and she let go of the glass shard, feeling a vague sense of anticipation.\nDrexel quickly realized that Calista was not his missing sister. Although disappointed, he calmed his urgent feelings. He gently reassured the frightened girl, \"Don’t be scared. The army is coming soon.\"\nAfter saying that, Drexel hurriedly moved on to the next room holding abducted children, still hoping to find his sister.\nShortly after he left, Calista was rescued along with many other children by soldiers who arrived soon after.\nLater, when her father came to pick her up, Calista saw that boy again. This time, she gathered the courage to tug at her father’s sleeve and asked curiously and timidly, \"Dad, who is that boy?\"\nHer father looked in the direction his daughter was pointing and was surprised to see Rear Admiral Kering and his son. He smiled and stroked Calista’s hair, saying, \"That’s Rear Admiral Kering and his second son, Drexel.\"\n\"Are they also looking for someone?\" Calista asked, pursing her lips carefully.\n\"Yes, I heard Rear Admiral Kering’s daughter is missing. I’ve seen that child; she’s a lively little girl. I hope the Kering family finds her soon,\" her father replied, ready to take Calista home.\nAs her father led her away, little Calista prayed for Drexel, hoping he would soon find his sister.\nAs Calista recalled the past, she felt somewhat dazed.\nOver the years, she had often seen Drexel on TV and in the news. Today was the first time she had met him in person again.\nMeanwhile, Drexel, the hero of the hour, hadn’t even noticed Calista. Perhaps he had long forgotten that he had once inadvertently saved a little girl.\nWhen Azura asked him that question, Drexel initially wanted to say no. But seeing Arix’s annoyingly smug expression, his eyes narrowed, and he flashed a mischievous smile.\n\"Yeah, isn’t she right beside you?\" Drexel said, throwing a flirtatious glance at Arix.\nCalista looked towards Arix upon hearing Drexel’s words. She noticed that although the girl was thin, she had beautiful features and actually matched Drexel quite well.\n\"Ah, so that’s Drexel’s type,\" Azura didn’t say much, but her gaze at Arix was a mix of challenge and disdain.\nClearly, Azura was a die-hard fan of Drexel and had already seen Arix as an enemy.\nArix, innocent in this conflict, twitched her mouth and glared fiercely at Drexel.\nIn the next moment, Arix pretended to be affectionate and looped her arms through Drexel’s. Under the cover, her fingers fiercely pinched the soft flesh of Drexel’s waist as she sweetly said, \"Oh, I just love Drexel so much right now.\"\nHer voice grew sweeter as her pinching grew fiercer.\nDrexel winced from the pain, feeling like that patch of flesh might bruise. He wanted to concede to Arix, but with two other girls there, he couldn’t swallow his pride.\nAfter a while, once Arix’s own hand hurt from the pinching, she finally let go, satisfied. Mimicking Drexel’s earlier flirtation, she threw him a coquettish look, saying, \"You chat with the girls; I’m off to the dorm.\"\nDrexel, in too much pain to speak, managed to weakly wave his hand, trying not to break his persona.\nArix then gave Azura and her friend a gentle, fake smile, feeling quite pleased with herself as she walked towards the dormitory area.\nThis freew(e)bnovel.(c)om",

      "content": "Chapter 34: New Roommates\nThere are a total of 11 buildings in the dormitory area of the training base, including one for the instructors.\nEach of the five military academies has exactly two buildings, with one for male and one for female students.\nArix followed the signs to the girls’ dorm. After scanning her surroundings, she stepped into the dorm building. Using the number on her bracelet, she found the room next to the door marked with her number.\nThe room was small, and the only furniture was three metal bunk beds and a large cabinet with six doors. It was so simple that even Arix was a bit shocked.\nArix stared at the dorm room, almost overwhelmed. She had not expected that in the interstellar era, military dormitories would still be as rundown as before.\nShe had imagined that the training dorms of the interstellar era would be high-tech individual rooms for everyone, each with a completely private sleeping pod. But the current setup seemed reasonable, after all, this was military training, not a holiday trip.\nShe had a guess that this place was a relic from a previous era, now just used as a temporary training site.\nBy the time she arrived, there were already four girls in the dorm. They were all grudgingly wiping their metal bunk beds, so engrossed in their task that they nearly didn’t notice Arix come in.\nArix walked to her assigned bunk bed, which was the lower one near the window. Because the window was open, there was more dust on her bed than elsewhere.\n\"Hello, I’m Maya Byrne. You haven’t picked up your supplies yet, right? You need to go to the bedmaker to get them, otherwise you can’t clean,\" Maya said kindly, smiling at Arix.\nArix turned to the owner of the voice. This girl had a gentle and delicate appearance, though her clothes were washed to the point of fading white. Her life might be tough. However, her difficult circumstances seemed not to affect her at all; she still maintained kindness towards everyone.\nArix liked this girl. She smiled back and said, \"Yeah, thank you. I’ll go get the supplies now.\"\n\"No problem, I haven’t finished getting mine either, I’ll come with you,\" Maya replied to Arix and then turned to the other three roommates and asked, \"Rei, do you guys need anything else? I can bring it up.\"\n\"No, we got everything,\" Rei shook her head, and the other two also indicated they had nothing left to get.\n\"Okay, got it,\" Maya said. She led Arix to the end of the corridor on the first floor, where they started to line up outside a room.\nArix didn’t ask further and quietly lined up behind Maya. She watched as new students entered the room; a few came out with blankets, but most left empty-handed.\nAfter puzzling for a moment, Arix looked carefully and finally understood why some students were leaving the room empty-handed, while others carried bedding and such.\nThose entering without a Space Button in hand left with one, whereas those carrying training supplies apparently couldn’t afford to buy a Space Button.\nA square Space Button costs 100,000 astrocredits. Most of the new students at the Hecaris Military Academy came from Planet Waste. For them, 100,000 astrocredits was like asking an ordinary person to buy a sports car—not something everyone could afford.\nAs the line slowly shortened, it was soon Arix and Maya’s turn. Maya reported her name and number to the bedmaker and requested two sets of training uniforms before stepping outside to wait for Arix.\n\"Name and number?\" the bedmaker asked in a procedural manner.\n\"Arix, number 69,\" Arix replied. She stood quietly, waiting for the bedmaker to verify her information on the opticomputer.\nThe bedmaker quickly confirmed her details and took out a Space Button from a box nearby and handed it to Arix.\n\"Whatever you store in the Space Button will only be returned after training,\" the bedmaker said with a serious, expressionless face.\n\"Okay, thank you,\" Arix replied, putting the Space Button on her finger before leaving the room. She and Maya then returned to their dormitory.\nUpon returning, Arix saw that another person had joined them—looks like the last roommate had also arrived. But seeing who it was, Arix couldn’t help but be amused.\n\"Is it really you?!\" Calista was even more surprised than Arix, her doe-like eyes wide open.\n\"Ah, I didn’t expect it to be you either. Seems like we’re meant to be,\" Arix couldn’t help laughing, finding it funny to end up in the same dorm as Drexel’s little fan.\nAlthough surprised, Calista shyly nodded her head in a polite greeting.\nMaya, with her big sister vibe, smiled warmly, \"Now that everyone’s here, let’s introduce ourselves. I’ll start. My name is Maya, from the Department of Combat, Planet Zythera. My psychic power is at Planet Class, and my physical strength is at Subgiant Class. Nice to meet you all.\"\nEveryone had a good impression of Maya and exchanged pleasantries.\n\"My name is Rei Ishihara, from the Department of Combat. I come from the same planet as Maya. My psychic power is at Planet Class and my physical power at Subgiant Class. Please take care of me,\" Rei was bright and cheerful, resembling a superhero from a comic book.\n\"My name is Leyla Öztürk, from the Psychic Ware department. My psychic power is at Subgiant Class, and my physical strength at Star Class. I’m delighted to meet you all,\" Leyla said with a gentle smile, carrying an ethereal aura.\nLeyla was arguably the most beautiful among them, with an elegant demeanor.\n\"I’m Lilou Chevalier, from the Department of Combat. My psychic power is at Star Class, and my physical condition is also at Subgiant Class. Pleased to meet you all,\" Lilou said. She was wearing glasses and appearing somewhat aloof, giving off a loner genius vibe.\n\"I’m Calista, from the Department of Chemistry. My psychic power is currently at Star-Class, and my physical strength is also at Star Class. I’m very happy to meet all of you,\" Calista said, sneakily glancing at Arix but quickly looking away.\nArix noticed Calista’s fleeting look and couldn’t help but smile. She found this girl named Calista genuinely adorable. She seemed like an innocent deer in the forest, terrified yet unable to resist peeking out to observe others.\nArix chuckled at her own thoughts and began her introduction, \"My name is Arix Kering, and I’m a student in the Department of Manufacture. My psychic power is at Supergiant Class, and my physical power is at Planet Class. Nice to meet you all.\"\nAfter finishing her introduction, Arix winked at Calista, causing her to shyly lower her head in embarrassment.",

      "content": "Chapter 35: Hard-working Girls\nCalista’s cheeks turned bright red under Arix’s gaze. She flicked her eyes nervously for a moment before it suddenly dawned on her.\n\"Wait, aren’t you a Thalis?\" Calista asked with wide eyes.\n\"Arix, don’t tell me you married into the Kering family and even changed your last name...\" Rei thought she had uncovered a shocking secret, so she excitedly sat next to Arix and chatted eagerly, pulling her arm.\n\"So, the leading lady from the Interstellarnet Headlines these past few days is our roommate,\" Leyla said, looking at Arix with a rare hint of surprise on her graceful face.\nThe girls’ stares made Arix unusually flustered, and she turned red as she began to explain, \"Okay, stop teasing me. You are my roommates, so I won’t hide it anymore. Drexel is actually my...\"\n\"Boyfriend!\" Rei interrupted excitedly.\n\"Fiancé.\" Leyla joined in the fun.\nCalista didn’t say anything, but her sparkling eyes were filled with curiosity.\nSeeing such an innocent Calista, Arix finally felt a pang of conscience.\nNo longer keeping them in suspense, Arix blinked innocently and revealed, \"Drexel is my older brother, the kind with blood ties. So, now you understand.\"\nArix’s words plunged the dorm into silence.\nEven the cute and well-behaved Calista looked at Arix with a serious doubtful expression.\nMaya chuckled, breaking the silence. \"So, the two of you fell in love only to find out you were long-lost siblings? Come on, I thought we’re way above that cliché romance.\"\n\"I’ll never trust love stories on the Interstellarnet again,\" Leyla said with hollow eyes. Then, as if she had seen through all worldly desires, she picked up a cloth and began to wipe her bed racks.\n\"You’re certainly a naughty girl,\" Rei said with admiration, blinking.\nShe then thought of the people on the Interstellarnet who were constantly arguing that Arix didn’t deserve Drexel. She really wanted to see their faces when they learned the truth.\nRei silently sympathized with them before picking up a basin and heading to the dormitory’s washbasin. Her stride seemed to carry the taste of seeing through life’s vicissitudes.\n\"You should have cleared up the rumors earlier. After all, Drexel has quite a few crazy fans who might hurt you out of jealousy,\" Lilou advised, pushing up her glasses.\nArix nodded. She had been indifferent about it, but Lilou’s words made her start to worry.\nThe rumors online would naturally be dealt with by Arix’s family. But the rumors within the military academy, since everyone was without their opticomputers at the moment, would have to wait until Arix could clear them up in person.\nThinking this, Arix relaxed and started to join in cleaning the dorm with everyone. By the time the dorm looked brand new, it was already time for lunch.\nArix and her new roommates took a quick shower and headed to the cafeteria together. It wasn’t far from the dorm, and they arrived after a short walk.\nThe cafeteria was decorated simply and cleanly, with students orderly picking up their meals from the serving area. They then carried their trays to the dining area to eat and chat.\nArix too picked up a tray and chose some of her favorite dishes from the wide variety available. She then walked over to the dining area.\n\"Arix, hi!\" Varden was also in the dining area, eating with some classmates. He greeted Arix as he saw her.\nArix smiled and greeted Varden back. Then, she and her roommates found a quiet spot to start their meal.\n\"Arix, who was that handsome guy greeting you? And you two seemed really close,\" Rei said teasingly.\nArix rolled her eyes at Rei and said dryly, \"He’s my cousin, the kind with blood ties.\"\n\"Another one ’with blood ties’? Are all handsome guys in the world tied with you by blood?\" Rei was stunned.\n\"Why, you think my cousin is handsome? Want me to introduce you?\" Arix joked, raising an eyebrow.\n\"Ah! No need,\" Rei blushed and coughed awkwardly.\nArix laughed at the silly situation.\nMidway through the meal, Rei suddenly remembered what the instructor had said. She looked up at her roommates and asked, \"So, who’s going to be our dorm leader?\"\n\"I can’t, I have much training to do and have no time for that,\" Lilou was the first to decline.\n\"I can’t either, I need to preview the Psychic Ware textbooks for freshmen,\" Leyla declined second.\n\"I need to preview the potion textbooks for freshmen too,\" Calista said apologetically.\n\"I need to preview the mecha manufacturing textbooks for freshmen as well. But Rei, I think you’d be great for it, why don’t you be our dorm leader?\" Arix said with a mischievous grin.\n\"Arix! If I become the dorm leader, you’ll be the first one I’ll hassle,\" Rei pretended to be angry and glared at Arix. Then she turned to Maya with a very gentle smile.\n\"Maya, it looks like the role of dorm leader is meant for you, don’t refuse, it’s decided then,\" Rei smiled sweetly, leaving no room for Maya to object.\nArix and the others also felt Maya was very suitable, and so they all nodded in agreement without saying a word.\nMaya, the person in question, could only smile helplessly and touch her forehead.\nThus, the decision for Maya to become the dorm leader was sneakily settled right there.\nIn another building of the training field, in the instructor’s office...\nVirtanen was sitting at his desk, flipping through the dormitory information sheets. When he reached Arix’s page, he took a closer look, double-checking to make sure he was seeing things correctly.\nVirtanen then looked up at Ortiz with a bit of uncertainty, \"Ortiz, did you change Arix’s roommates?\"\n\"Yes, I changed them. I arranged for the girls with the best physical conditioning from Hecaris Military Academy to be Arix’s roommates,\" Ortiz didn’t hide anything.\n\"Hmm? Any particular reason for that?\" Virtanen asked, curious.\nOrtiz revealed a meaningful smile and said, \"Competition is a good thing. Now that she’s surrounded by the best, I believe even if Arix were as weak as a tiny hamster, she would still enhance her physical condition through competition.\"\n\"That’s a great idea, typical of Ortiz.\" Virtanen’s eyes lit up, seeing the potential in the plan, and he gave Ortiz an admiring thumbs up.\nBauer, puffing on a cigarette, didn’t say anything, but those who knew him understood that his silence was an approval of the strategy.",

      "content": "Chapter 36: Training Starts\nThe next morning in the dormitory, Maya woke Arix first, then continued to rouse the next person.\nThe girls, sleepy and yawning non-stop, gradually got up and changed into their training gear. Then they headed to the sinks to start freshening up.\nAfter breakfast in the cafeteria, Arix and her group walked to the training ground. By this time, the square was already filled with many early students.\nThe students from the five military academies naturally clustered together. Centered around their own academies, they intuitively formed five groups, each keeping to themselves.\nWhere there are people, there is isolation and scheming.\nThere was also a hierarchy of disdain among the military academies. For instance, students from the Ceres Military Academy looked down on those from the Mulado Military Academy for being pretentiously aloof; whereas the Mulado students were envious of the Ceres Academy’s abundant resources.\nSimilarly, the wealthy students of the Snorri Military Academy scorned the poorer students from the Hecaris Military Academy. However, the Hecaris students had no respect for those from The Snorri Academy who solved problems merely with money.\nThe students from The Koros Military Academy were generally ignored by the other four academies, as they were known to be battle-crazed and best left unprovoked.\nWhile waiting for the instructor, even Arix received several scornful looks from the wealthy Snorri students.\nLooking at this group with their noses in the air, Arix’s fingers twitched slightly. It took all her willpower to resist the urge to stick her fingers up their nostrils.\nFortunately, at that moment, the instructors for the five military academies arrived, and Arix nearly broke her demure demeanor. She breathed a sigh of relief.\nThe three instructors responsible for the Hecaris Military Academy arrived as well.\nOrtiz blew his whistle hanging around his neck first. The piercing sound drew all students’ attention towards him.\n\"All students, follow my command. Each dorm forms a line, with the dorm leader at the front. The first row should form three teams, with 18 people in each line. The last fifty-five teams, align with those in front. Execute immediately!\" Ortiz commanded loudly and sternly.\n\"Yes, Sir!\" responded the students from The Hecaris Military Academy, and in a short while, they were neatly arranged in three vertical rows.\n\"Good, today is the first day of training. This morning, we’ll start with something simple, like a 20-kilometer weighted cross-country,\" Ortiz said, then turned to Virtanen and Bauer. \"The weight rings can be distributed now.\"\n\"Okay,\" Virtanen and Bauer nodded. They locked heavy weight rings around the limbs of every student present.\nArix’s limbs were fitted weight rings, each weighing roughly 50 kg. She felt that, perhaps, the weights carried by each person seemed to vary.\nAfter all students from the Hecaris Military Academy had their weight rings on, Virtanen and Bauer reported back to Ortiz.\nOrtiz, seeing students murmuring doubts, spoke sternly and seriously, \"The weight rings are custom-made according to each of your physiques. So, stop wondering why others’ weights differ from yours.\"\nHis words brought a moment of realization to the students, and they all quieted down.\nAfter pulling a fast one on the students, Ortiz whispered to Virtanen, \"You set Arix’s weight rings to Star-Class, right?\"\nVirtanen didn’t respond verbally but gave Ortiz an ’ok’ gesture.\nSatisfied, Ortiz smiled and joined the other two instructors in the back of an off-road vehicle. He shouted to the students, \"Now, all of you, follow me.\"\n\"Yes, sir!\" the students from the Hecaris Military Academy shouted energetically. They then started running behind the off-road vehicle.\nStudents from the other four military academies watched as The Hecaris Military Academy’s students followed the off-road vehicle out of the training base. Then, they too began their own training exercises with their respective instructors.\nOutside the base, The Hecaris Military Academy’s students had already run 5 kilometers following the off-road vehicle.\nA small group managed to keep up at first. As time passed, however, their legs grew increasingly sore and weak, and breathing became more difficult. Still, they clenched their teeth and struggled to keep up with the vehicle.\nArix was among them. Her physical condition was below average among other students, and the instructors had given her \"special attention\" with the weight rings—a situation that made it nearly impossible for her to keep up with most. She gradually found herself falling behind the group.\n\"Ortiz, it looks like Arix is falling behind,\" Virtanen said worriedly, looking back.\n\"Just this little distance and she’s struggling? She’s supposed to have Planet-Class physical power, after all,\" Ortiz frowned, clearly disappointed.\nVirtanen explained, \"I heard she was only Moon-Class a month ago. It seems she only reached Planet Class through a Planet-Class Booster.\" He regretted setting Arix’s weight rings to Star-Class.\nHearing this, Ortiz’s frown deepened. He dropped a \"I’ll check on her\" and started running towards the back of the group.\nSome of the students had been slacking off, but seeing the instructor coming towards them, they suddenly found their legs no longer hurt and sped up.\nOrtiz squinted slightly, silently memorizing the faces of these students. He decided to increase the weight of their rings next time.\nHowever, his current concern was Arix. Ortiz suspected she was slacking, but she genuinely looked like she was running for her life.\nWith this thought, Ortiz, feeling unusually guilty, touched his nose. Then, with a determined look, he made his way to the back of the group and started shouting, \"Speed up! If we encounter an insectoid, even chickens would outrun you!\"\n\"Running this slow, you might as well go home and farm! At least you won’t starve to death then!\"\n\"Come on! Say it loud: \"Lose skin, lose flesh, never fall out! Bleed, sweat, but never shout!\"\" Ortiz roared.\n\"Come on! Say it loud: \"Lose skin, lose flesh, never fall out! Bleed, sweat, but never shout!\" The students at the back, nearly crying, chanted the slogan.\n\"Such a quiet voice, didn’t you eat? Use all your strength!\" Ortiz yelled.\n\"Come on! Say it loud: \"Lose skin, lose flesh, never fall out! Bleed, sweat, but never shout!\"\nThis time, the chant was deafening. Not just the students at the back, but even those at the front joined in, as if to motivate their fellow classmates.\nArix was also shouting. She clenched her lips tightly, pushing herself to her limits to keep up with the main group, determined not to fall behind.\nOrtiz, observing Arix’s twisted but determined face, didn’t find it ugly at all. Instead, he felt a genuine sense of relief and approval from deep within.",

      "content": "Chapter 37: Drexel’s Anger\n13miles...\n17 miles...\n...\nArix didn’t know how long she had been running, but now she felt totally exhausted. Even the air she breathed felt like it had blades, painfully scraping her throat.\nHer mind was slowly going blank. Then suddenly, Arix stumbled, losing her balance. Just before she passed out, she thought she heard Drexel’s voice, filled with panic.\n\"Arix!\"\nDrexel was close by. He had initially come back to laugh at his sister but instead saw Arix collapsing. His heart seemed to stop for several seconds.\nDrexel ran to her in panic. He caught Arix as she passed out and pulled her close to his chest. Then he frantically started checking on her.\n\"Let me handle this, Drexel. I’m a student of the Department of Chemistry, and I’ve learned some medical stuff,\" Calista said as she pushed through the crowd of students. She got to Arix’s side and immediately started examining her.\nFirst, she checked Arix’s eyes, then felt her carotid artery. After a moment, she breathed a slight sigh of relief, \"Her heart is just beating fast; she’s not in any life-threatening danger.\"\nAfter saying that, Calista began to check Arix’s limbs. However, as she lifted her hand, her expression suddenly froze. Her eyes widened in disbelief.\n\"This is outrageous!\"\nCalista stared intently at the weight ring on Arix’s wrist, her lower lip bitten tightly, her eyes slightly reddened with anger.\n\"Why are you crying? Didn’t you say my sister is not in serious danger? Do we need to find a handsome guy to give her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation?\" Drexel, relieved that Arix wasn’t in mortal peril, still had the mood to joke.\nCalista, face cold, didn’t respond. She grabbed Drexel’s hand, placing the hand wearing the weight ring in his, and then swapped it with her own weighted hand.\nDrexel was initially confused by Calista’s actions. However, when Calista’s hand also rested in his, he suddenly realized something. His voice hoarse, he asked, \"What’s your physical power level?\"\n\"I’m Star-Class,\" Calista replied. Her eyes blazed with anger, her tone chilly.\nAccording to the rules, Star-Class weight rings are 100 kilograms, and Planet Class rings are 60 kilograms. Calista knew that only three instructors could tamper with such things.\nDrexel had thought of it too; if it weren’t for the reality right in front of him, he would never have imagined that his precious sister was being sabotaged right under his nose.\n\"The instructors are here.\" A student suddenly shouted.\nThen the three instructors walked through the crowd and also saw Arix, unconscious.\nOrtiz stepped forward, intending to take Arix to the medical room. But as soon as he reached out, an extremely angry Drexel forcefully slapped his hand away.\nBefore Ortiz could react, he saw a girl blocking Drexel.\nCalista firmly grabbed Drexel’s arm, which was bulging with veins. She motioned for him to look at a tree branch nearby.\nThere was a all-direction surveillance camera recording everything without any blind spots.\nDrexel’s expression darkened, and he regained some sense of calm. He said to the instructors with a forced smile, \"You don’t have to do this. She’s my sister. I’ll handle it.\"\nWith that, Drexel no longer paid any attention to the three instructors and carefully picked up the unconscious Arix. He then headed towards the medical facility at the training base.\nCalista also ignored the instructors and hurried to follow Drexel, helping support the unconscious Arix.\nOrtiz, left with nothing to do, stood awkwardly and touched his nose. He then shouted to the students still discussing Arix’s collapse, \"Training’s over, head back now. Anyone who doesn’t go back gets extra training.\"\nWith these words, the students scattered almost instantly, leaving the area deserted.\n\"Ortiz, you might want to be careful from now on. That young man’s furious gaze was hardly concealed,\" Virtanen cautiously said.\n\"What?\" Ortiz was displeased upon hearing this and immediately retorted, \"Why me alone? Aren’t you two also instructors?\"\n\"You’re the head. Even if you’re not guilty, if a student has a health issue, it’s on you,\" Bauer pointedly said.\nOrtiz was speechless.\n...\nAt the instructors’ dorm at noon, just as Ortiz entered his room to rest, he heard the door lock behind him. He sighed resignedly, then turned to see Drexel and said, \"Was it so urgent that you couldn’t even wait until evening?\"\n\"You knew I would come, so it was indeed you bullying my sister,\" Drexel stated firmly. His eyes narrowed dangerously, his eyebrows raised thoughtfully.\n\"What do you mean ’bully’? I was actually doing this for Arix’s own good,\" Ortiz replied with a bitter smile.\nDrexel laughed coldly, his gaze even icier as he retorted, \"Maybe you should visit the medical room too. After all, I’m also doing this for your own good!\"\nDrexel emphasized his last words. Just as he was about to attack, his arms were seized by the two instructors who had appeared behind him.\n\"Good thing we arrived in time. Seems my lock-picking skills haven’t a bit rusted yet,\" Virtanen said somewhat shyly.\nDrexel turned his head and noticed that the door he had just closed was now open. He chuckled without any hint of panic, \"One or three, it doesn’t matter. Come at me all together.\"\n\"I admire your vigorous state and protective spirit, kid. Seeing you makes me realize that I’m really getting old,\" Bauer remarked, puffing on a cigarette.\nVirtanen, seeing his teammates were unreliable, stepped forward to mediate and explain, \"You’ve misunderstood. We aren’t trying to make things difficult for her. It’s actually because President Gunder specifically ordered us to elevate Arix’s physique to Star-Class by the end of the training. That’s why we were paying extra attention to her training.\"\nAlthough Drexel was still angry, his mind had begun to cool down.\nBauer, seeing this, released his hold on Drexel and walked alone to the windowsill, puffing on his cigarette.\n\"You should know Arix’s situation best. If her physique doesn’t improve, she’ll face even more harm due to her psychic powers in the future. So, do you still think I’m trying to sabotage her?\" Ortiz took a cigarette from Bauer, lit it, and spoke in a calm voice.\nArix’s overwhelmingly strong psychic power was like a double-edged sword. While it protected her, it also constantly threatened her life.\nDrexel finally calmed down completely. He suddenly realized that the concerns the instructors had for Arix might not be less than his own.\nIt seemed he had been mistaken this time.\nWith this thought, Drexel bowed deeply to the three instructors as an apology. With a heavy heart, he turned and left the instructors’ dorm.\nOrtiz’s face wore a look of enduring grievance throughout the ordeal, but he remained silent and watched as Drexel departed.\nHowever, the moment he reached to close the door, the look of grievance on Ortiz’s face disappeared instantly, and he expressed a sense of relief, \"Thank heavens. But why is he and his sister so different? Why does his physical strength completely cloud his mental power?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 38: She Wants It Both\nBauer was leaning against the window, comfortably smoking a cigarette.\nFrom the corner of his eye, he caught sight of Ortiz looking scared and started to mock him, \"Come on, you’re a lieutenant of the Fifth Legion. How can you be afraid of a military academy freshman? If this gets out to the legion, you’ll be the laughing stock.\"\nOrtiz didn’t care about Bauer’s mocking and retorted lazily, \"If we keep this between us, no one will know.\"\n\"Coward,\" Bauer rolled his eyes in disgust.\n\"Coward or not... That depends on who it is. We all know that there’s a high chance Drexel will be the admiral of the Fifth Legion in the future. Try being brave against him...\" Ortiz replied unwillingly. Then he thought of something else and added with relief, \"Luckily, he’s young now and easier to fool, or else we couldn’t have settled today’s matter so easily.\"\n\"Could it be that there really was a problem with the weight ring today?\" Bauer frowned seriously.\n\"Logically, we were correct, but Arix just can’t be dealt with by usual standards,\" Ortiz said with a gloomy face. He forwarded the information he had just received on his optic computer to Virtanen and Bauer, then continued, \"This is from the medical room, just sent over. Arix’s health report. Take a look.\"\nAfter both had carefully read the information, Bauer, speechless, rubbed his forehead and said, \"It looks like President Gunder has set a trap for us, and we just walked right into it.\"\nVirtanen’s face looked bitter as he complained, \" A body neglected for over a decade, nourished well for just one month, and then trained for another month to rise to Star-Class? If there were such a good deal in the world, let me be the first to know.\"\n\"Stop dreaming. It’s not even dark yet, and you’re already dreaming so sweetly,\" Ortiz shot Virtanen a glance.\nBauer, somewhat skeptical, frowned and said, \"But Ortiz, are you sure there’s no mistake with this medical report? She’s been malnourished for over ten years? If we consider interstellar law, that’s enough to charge the Kering family with child abuse.\"\nOrtiz sighed, \"One hundred percent correct. I asked Marlone, and he said his niece Arix has been drifting on Planet Waste all these years. It was only a month ago that she was found and brought back to the Kering family. Otherwise, her physique wouldn’t just be at Planet Class. But given the living conditions on Planet Waste... her merely being malnourished is actually the best outcome.\"\n\"What about her psychic power? If she really was just at Planet Class, even Moon-Class physically, she should have died a long time ago. She couldn’t have survived until now,\" Bauer asked curiously.\n\"Oh, I heard that a month ago she only had Moon-Class psychic power. Then, someone made her drink poison. They intended to destroy Arix, but it ended up fully awakening her Supergiant-Class psychic power instead,\" Ortiz explained. He found the story increasingly melodramatic, as it resembled the plots of s he read on the interstellarnet.\nThe main character doesn’t die on Planet Waste, doesn’t die from poisoning, meets a noble benefactor, enrolls in the military academy, finds her biological parents—it was like a checklist for a protagonist.\n\"Ortiz, did you think of something?\" Virtanen noticed Ortiz was silent for a while and asked in confusion.\n\"I’m thinking that maybe we underestimated Arix,\" Ortiz muttered.\n\"We definitely underestimated how fragile Arix is. High-intensity training seems unsuitable for her now. For now, let’s stick to the normal training regimen for someone with Planet-Class physique, and we’ll see about the rest later,\" Bauer decided firmly.\nOrtiz wanted to say more; he actually thought Arix seemed very much like a protagonist. So, he felt even if they pushed her to the limits in training, she’d likely be fine. After all, most protagonists are like weeds, always bouncing back.\nBut in the end, he wisely kept these thoughts to himself. After all, a novel is just a novel, not to be confused with reality.\nThe medical room was bustling now.\nThis time, many students had gotten injured during the weighted cross-country run. However, most of them had minor injuries like sprained ligaments or twisted ankles, which were quickly healed with a scan from the treatment device.\nThose with slightly more severe injuries, like Arix, just needed to spend half an hour in the healing pod before being transferred to a regular bed. Students who had just woken up and didn’t want to stay in the hospital could even go back to their dorms directly.\nDrexel, who was looking after Arix in the hospital, politely saw off five girls who had come to visit Arix. Then he sat back down beside the hospital bed, continuing to peel the fruit in hand.\nArix was on the hospital bed, and now her fingers twitched for a bit. She slowly opened her eyes and turned her head to see Drexel, who was focused on peeling the fruit.\n\"Drexel...\" Arix called out in a hoarse voice.\nDrexel looked up with a bit of surprise, \"You’re awake! Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?\"\n\"Water,\" Arix’s voice was hoarse and weak.\n\"Oh, right, right, just a second.\" Drexel hurriedly got up, put down the fruit, and clumsily poured a glass of water. Ta carefully handed it over.\nArix sat up, leaning her upper body against the headboard, and took the water from Drexel. She drank the whole glass and finally felt her throat ease.\n\"Thanks, I’m fine now,\" Arix said with a gentle smile towards Drexel.\nDrexel took back the empty cup and hesitated for a moment before carefully asking, \"Do you know everything that’s been going on?\"\n\"What do you mean? About my psychic power or the tampered weighted ring?\" Arix said nonchalantly.\nArix was well aware of her own condition. A mismatch between her physique and psychic power? She thought she just needed more training. That was also why she didn’t speak up, even though she knew something was off with the weighted ring.\nDrexel was a bit flustered; he was a bit surprised that Arix knew everything.\n\"So, what are you thinking now? How about we skip the hardship? After the training ends, let Mom and Dad get you some supplements to improve your physique,\" Drexel said, worried about Arix’s condition but reluctant to see his sister suffer through the training.\nArix looked at Drexel, who was obviously distressed, and smiled. She reached out and grasped Drexel’s wrist, comforting him with a laugh, \"Alright, stop worrying. You’re frowning too much and the wrinkles are starting to grow.\"\n\"How can I not worry? You’re my only sister,\" Drexel said this, but his heart felt a bit more at ease. He then asked, \"So, what do you plan to do next?\"\n\"I guess I’ll just follow the instructors’ training plans. Then, I’ll take those supplements you mentioned,\" Arix said casually.\nDrexel rolled his eyes and muttered, \"Here I am worrying about which option you should take, and it turns out you want to take them both?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 39: Sweet Roommates\nArix had rested for a while in the hospital room. When she felt her strength had mostly returned, she and Drexel left the medical room together.\nNot long after they left the medical room, Arix noticed quite a few freshmen from various military academies, secretly watching her and Drexel, some openly, some covertly.\n\"Ah, look, it’s Arix and Drexel.\"\n\"Wow! It looks like what they said on the interstellarnet is true. They must be seeing each other now.\"\n\"I’m 100% sure it is true. I heard this morning during the training, Arix just fainted, and Drexel was super nervous and rushed her straight to the medical room. He was so anxious that even the doctor got scared, thinking that the one he was holding must be dead.\"\n\"Haha, what a scene. Too bad we were also on training at that time, or I would have definitely come to watch.\"\nHaving listen to all the gossip about herself, Arix felt utterly disheveled.\nShe now regretted why she hadn’t debunked the rumors earlier. Now she felt so embarrassed.\n\"Maybe I should just go back alone.\" Arix looked at her rumored \"boyfriend,\" almost unable to face herself.\n\"I’ll walk you to the dorm building then leave,\" Drexel said, looking at her like he was dealing with an unreasonable child, his face full of indulgence.\nDrexel now was like a mama bear protecting her cub. He couldn’t leave without making sure his cub was safe.\nArix bit her lip, hesitating. In the end, she could only frown and let Drexel walk her to the dorm building.\nAfter saying goodbye, Arix, as if scared of something, dashed back to her dorm.\nDrexel stayed where he was, watching Arix’s retreating figure with a satisfied smile, \"It seems Arix has indeed recovered.\"\nArix returned to her dorm to find that none of her roommates were there.\nShe looked up at the clock on the wall, only to realize it was already 3 PM. By this time, the afternoon training had probably started for an hour.\nArix wasn’t worried. Drexel had told her earlier that he had already requested a half-day sick leave for her. She could indeed take it easy this afternoon.\nThinking this, Arix walked towards her bed in a good mood. She saw a bunch of snacks placed next to her pillow.\nShe knew it was definitely her lovely roommates’ doing.\nArix’s lips curved. She sat on her bed feeling warm inside, took out a potion book from her Space Button, and started to enjoy reading while munching on snacks.\nTime flew by quickly, and as the red sunset began to reflect in the dorm window, Arix’s roommates finally came back.\n\"Arix, you’re back,\" Calista greeted her weakly. She was not in a good state, but she perked up a bit seeing Arix.\n\"Why do you all look like this?\" Arix exclaimed in surprise. She stared in astonishment at her roommates, who looked as if they had been up for several nights.\nAs soon as Rei entered the dorm, she collapsed onto her bed and groaned, \"Don’t even ask—it was psychic power training this afternoon. We spent practically the whole time either falling on our faces or on our way down.\"\n\"Why do we need to wear weighted rings during psychic power training? I’m starting to get a bad feeling about this. Are we going to wear these rings in all future training sessions?\" Leyla lamented, sitting on her bed as if drained of all her energy.\n\"The likelihood is above 90%, I figured,\" Lilou added solemnly.\nArix, the first victim of the weighted rings, gasped at Lilou’s comment and soon joined her roommates in their despondency.\n\"Fine, there’s no way that we can stop it. Let’s shower first, then we’ll lie down and rest,\" Maya suggested, breaking the increasingly heavy mood. She took her toiletries from her locker and headed to the communal bathroom in the dorm hallway.\nThe girls groaned in resignation and followed her with their towels.\nWhen they returned, they were clean and refreshed, yet all collapsed on their beds, unwilling to move.\nBefore long, Arix noticed the dorm had fallen completely silent. She looked up to see her roommates had all fallen asleep.\nShaking her head with a smile, Arix got up, turned off the lights, and let the girls sleep soundly.\nThe next morning, the wake-up whistle sounded from downstairs.\nArix and her roommates quickly washed up and dressed. After breakfast in the cafeteria, they arrived at the training field at 8 AM.\nToday’s training was weighted cross-country running. To Arix’s surprise, the weight of her rings had been increased to 60kg.\nShe looked puzzled at Virtanen, who was distributing the rings, and asked, \"Are you sure you didn’t make a mistake with mine?\"\n\"No mistake, this is the correct ring for your Planet Class physique!\" Virtanen confirmed hastily, his eyes darting away nervously.\nThen, like a chick evading a hawk, he quickly finished distributing the rings to Arix’s row and hurried away, looking guilty.\nArix, filled with questions about the instructor’s behavior, said nothing and faithfully followed the team, starting to run.\nInitially, Maya and the others were worried about Arix, so they slowed down to run alongside her. Seeing no issues, they eventually picked up the pace and ran ahead.\nOrtiz and his two colleagues kept a discreet watch on Arix. Seeing that she was managing well, they breathed a sigh of relief almost simultaneously.\n\"It seems that gradual progression is the right approach,\" Ortiz remarked with relief.\n\"Yeah, let’s keep it this way for the time being,\" Bauer agreed.\n\"But what about the afternoon’s psychic power training? Could there be any issues there?\" Virtanen suddenly chimed in, his question hanging awkwardly in the air.\nThe air in the vehicle turned silent, clearly indicating Virtanen had brought up an inappropriate topic.\nFeeling the intense stares of the other two, Virtanen shrank into a corner of the vehicle, his demeanor as guilty and pitiful as a dog who had chewed the wrong tube.\n\"Ortiz, my fists are getting itchy, and you’re going to be blind for the next ten minutes, right?\" Bauer said, his voice light but his eyes locked intensely on Virtanen in the corner.\n\"Oh, what a coincidence, I was thinking the same,\" Ortiz added with a menacing grin as he approached Virtanen.\n\"Wow!! Don’t come over here!\" Virtanen’s pleas and screams filled the vehicle but were soon drowned out by the others’ laughter.",

After the instructors dismissed everyone, the new students either headed to the cafeteria or went back to their dorms.\nArix declined to join Maya for lunch. She went back to her dorm alone and quickly took a shower.\nThen, she took a tube of nutrition fluid from her Space Button. She dealt with lunch quickly, then collapsed on her bed, too exhausted to move.\nThe fatigue, both physical and mental, quickly sent Arix into a deep sleep.\nWhen Maya woke her up, Arix saw her roommates looking fresh and chatty, gossiping animatedly.\nAt that moment, Arix felt a pang of jealousy.\nAll of them were new students, yet her roommates seemed to have much more physical stamina than her. They were able to chat so relaxedly after the intense morning session, which felt like a blatant show-off.\n\"Arix, wake up. It’s almost 2 PM. We need to start the afternoon session of psychic power training,\" Maya reminded her.\nFrom the moment Maya became the dorm leader, she was destined to worry about everyone in the dorm, especially Arix. After all, Arix was the only one who had been sent to the medical room so far.\nThe incident of Arix entering the medical room had spread among the students at various military schools. Her roommates tactfully didn’t mention it, fearing it might hurt Arix’s feelings.\nBut the other students had no such reservations. They seemed to discuss it almost all the time—while eating, sleeping, and even in the restroom.\nFor instance, at cafeteria tables...\n\"Hey, did you hear? Arix from the Hecaris Military Academy fainted yesterday. She fell so badly that she bled from her arm.\"\nOr on dorm beds...\n\"Arix knocked herself out during training yesterday, and even split her head open. Thankfully you weren’t there; the blood everywhere was terrifying.\"\nAnd in restroom stalls...\n\"I heard Arix spun around three full circles before hitting the ground when she fell. It looked so dramatic, even Drexel Kering was stunned for seconds before he ran to take her to the doctor.\"\nArix had no idea that her simple fainting due to physical exhaustion had been turned into numerous exaggerated stories, making her quite famous across the military academies.\nNow, as Arix shakily got up and rubbed her sore, numb knees, she and her roommates headed to the training ground. She felt many new students secretly sizing her up along the way.\nArix thought it was still because of the rumors about her and Drexel. She tried to maintain a poker face, but deep down, she was really panicking.\nShe noticed that more and more people were paying attention to her. Just yesterday, only a few gossip lovers were interested, but today, even students from other military academies were joining in on the buzz.\nThankfully, as soon as the instructors arrived, everyone quickly averted their gaze, otherwise Arix would have been so embarrassed that she might have dug a hole right through the training field with her cringe.\nAs soon as the Hecaris Military Academy students saw the instructor, they quickly lined up in the formation they had learned the day before yesterday.\nThey stood erect, with chests puffed out and an air of confidence, nothing like their previous chatty selves.\nOrtiz surveyed all the students of the Hecaris Military Academy and began, \"This afternoon we’ll continue with psychic power training. I want to emphasize something just before that. Yesterday, some students brought Psychic Wares into the training room. Do you think such hidden cheating is beneficial for your future?\"\n\"No!\" the students shouted in unison.\nThe instructor’s and classmates’ thunderous words made the few students who had Psychic Wares on them blush. They silently removed their Psychic Wares and quietly stashed them into their Space Buttons.\nOrtiz noticed these actions and finally allowed a slight smile to appear, \"Good, now everyone follow me to the psychic power training field.\"\nThe psychic power training field was located at the very back of the training base. Compared to the other more basic fields, this one finally had a bit of a star-age style.\nBefore entering the training field, the students had to line up and pass through a security gate.\nNext to the gate stood a soldier from the Fifth Legion, who used an opticomputer in conjunction with the gate to check the students.\nEach time a student paused in front of the security gate, a ray beam would scan them from head to toe to ensure they carried no dangerous items.\nWhen a student was cleared, a mechanical voice from the soldier’s opticomputer would announce, \"Inspection passed. No dangerous items carried. Clearance granted.\"\n\"I wonder which psychic power training center we’ll go to today. The pain from yesterday’s Gravity Training Center is still haunting me,\" Rei moaned as he queued up.\n\"As long as it’s not the Hypnosis Training Center, I think I can handle anything,\" Lilou commented. She disliked the feeling of being hypnotized, as if her psychic world was stripped bare, leaving her feeling utterly insecure.\n\"In that case, the Control Training Room is the best. You just need to use your psychic power to control objects and attack,\" Leyla sighed.\nUnlike her roommates, who had been beaten down in the psychic power training rooms, Arix perked up the moment she saw the psychic power training field, her spirits instantly lifted.\nArix much preferred the high-tech psychic power training grounds to physical training sites.\nHer love for high-tech was akin to Cirilla’s excitement when facing someone stronger than herself. No hardships could deter their relentless pursuit of pushing their limits.\nEven without seeing the full extent of the psychic power training field yet, Arix was already bubbling with excitement.\n\"Arix Kering, inspection passed. No dangerous items carried. Clearance granted.\"\n\"You may enter now,\" said the nearby soldier coldly.\n\"Thank you,\" Arix responded politely. She smiled with anticipation as she walked toward the psychic power training room.\nThe psychic power training field was indoors, divided into five separate training centers. Instructor Virtanen was currently standing at the entrance of the Gravity Training Center, logging each student’s entry with his opticomputer.\nSeeing that it was the Gravity Training Center, Arix felt a bit sorry for Rei.",

      "content": "Chapter 41: Shocks Everyone\nThere was no line before the Gravity Training Center. Just as Arix was about to walk straight in, Virtanen stopped her with his hand.\nArix looked at Virtanen, puzzled, as she hadn’t seen him stop any other students just before her.\nVirtanen felt a bit awkward under Arix’s gaze. He coughed and said casually, \"Arix. Remember, safety first, and don’t push yourself too hard.\"\n\"Okay,\" Arix replied obediently. She was a bit confused but sensed no malice from the instructor.\n\"Go ahead,\" Virtanen said.\nHe watched Arix enter the Gravity Training Center, silently cheering her on and whispering to himself, \"After all, whether I sleep in the bed or the hallway tonight depends on you.\"\nAs soon as Arix entered the training area, it felt like stepping into a huge indoor training ground. The center featured a circular track about 3000 meters long. What was special, though, were the walls on both sides of the track made of a unique material that created light barriers, seemingly isolating the special environment of the track.\nThe light barriers made the scene on the track a bit blurry, but from the outside,people could still vaguely see.\nAt that moment, many students were moving forward on the track, their movements slow and difficult, like toddlers.\nEvery so often, a student would fall flat. They seemed to be struck down by an invisible meteor, crashing face down instantly.\nArix suddenly felt a phantom pain on her face. She swallowed before walking to the starting point of the track and politely greeted Ortiz and Bauer, \"Sir, good afternoon.\"\nOrtiz and Bauer, both gentle in demeanor, nodded back to Arix.\nThen Ortiz and Bauer looked at each other for a moment. After a silent exchange of glances, Ortiz finally conceded defeat.\nThe defeated Ortiz covertly rolled his eyes at Bauer and looked at Arix, pretending to be stern. He said, \"The main purpose of the Gravity Training Center is to enhance the resistance of your psychic barriers. The gravity will get stronger as you go further. If you feel it’s too much, don’t push yourself. Just remove your bracelet, and the gravity will drop down. Got it?\"\n\"Uh-huh, okay,\" Arix replied obediently.\nShe felt that today, the instructors were a bit overly fussy, but she only dared to grumble about it internally, never aloud.\nAfter putting on the weight ring provided by the instructors, Arix stepped onto the track of the training ground.\nAs soon as she stood on the track, Arix instantly felt a heavy pressure pushing down from above. It was as if the normal gravity had suddenly increased tenfold.\nIn simple terms, it was like a normal person wearing a 500 kg weight ring, making it extremely difficult to move.\nArix tried to walk. She found it difficult, but not yet to the point where she needed to deploy her psychic shield.\nAnd since the instructors had said the gravity would keep increasing, Arix also wanted to see where her limit was.\nAs Arix walked into the training area, she initially resisted using her psychic shield, which quickly marked her as overly confident by her peers on the gravity track.\nMost of the students secretly mocked her, recalling a previous student who had tried the same approach and had quickly depleted his energy, ultimately receiving a low score from the instructors.\nArix was unaware of the mocking glances from her classmates as she struggled to move her feet alone.\nUnknowingly, she moved from the tenfold gravity area to the twentyfold gravity track.\nAs soon as she stepped in, the increased gravity crushed her unprepared, causing her to fall embarrassingly. She finally understood the hard falls her classmates had experienced.\nAs the students saw Arix’s fall, they immediately rejoiced in her misfortune.\n\"I told you she’d fall as soon as she hit the twentyfold gravity track, haha!\"\n\"What a fool, totally overestimating herself!\"\n\"And she’s supposed to be top ten among the freshmen. Turns out, without Drexel, she’d be nothing.\"\nAmidst the laughter, Arix struggled to her feet. She glanced around at those who mocked her, silently adding them to her list for future payback. She would surely shock them with her power when the opportunity arose.\nArix refocused and drew on the psychic power from her inner psychic world.\nThe energy formed an egg-shaped shield around her, blocking the intense gravity from above.\nAs soon as the psychic shield was activated, Arix no longer felt the overwhelming pressure.\nShe looked around at her classmates with a smirk of triumph and then confidently walked away under their watchful eyes.\nThough her physical power might have been lacking, her psychic power was unmatched in her class.\nThe students were stunned. They slowly realized that although Arix might physically seem weak, her psychic abilities were possibly the strongest in the class.\nThose who had just mocked her fell silent, the somewhat capable ones quietly slipping away, while the truly weak could only stay put under the gravity, their faces red with embarrassment.\nMeanwhile, in the instructor’s office, the trio were becoming impatient.\n\"Arix has been in there for about ten minutes now, I wonder how she’s doing,\" Ortiz expressed his concern.\n\"This kid is pretty stubborn, maybe you should go check on her. Don’t let her end up in the doctor’s again,\" Bauer, who had seen Arix’s stubborn streak, suggested with a hint of worry.\n\"Alright, I’ll go check on her. Wait for me here,\" Ortiz said. He got ready to enter, yet just then, Arix showed up on her own.\nWatching Arix, who appeared not at all disheveled, Ortiz thought she hadn’t gone far at all. He frowned slightly in displeasure and asked, \"How come you got out so quickly?\"\n\"I finished, so I came out,\" Arix replied. She looked puzzled at Ortiz, who seemed unhappy.\n\"Hey, you little liar!\" Ortiz simply didn’t believe Arix. No one knew the gravity track better than he did. Even someone with Supergiant-Class psychic power would need an hour to complete the course.\nBut Arix had only been gone for, at most, about ten minutes.\nSince Arix was a girl, Ortiz didn’t think it was appropriate to scold her too fiercely. So he said more gently, \"Your brother, Drexel, hasn’t come out yet.\"\n\"Oh, I saw him. He even told me to wait for him so we could go to the cafeteria for dinner together,\" Arix said, blinking.\nOrtiz was momentarily at a loss for words. This kid really was stubborn. It seemed he needed to show some proof.\nWith that thought, Ortiz used his opticomputer to send a message to a colleague in the surveillance room, asking them to send him Arix’s scores from the Gravity Training Center.\nThe colleague was efficient. Almost three seconds after the message was sent, they sent over Arix’s scores.",

      "content": "Chapter 42: A \"Friend\"\nOrtiz received the message and looked up at Arix again, shooting her a \"you’re in big trouble\" glare. Then, he opened the report.\nTraining Report\nSchool:\nHecaristhe Hecaris Military Academy\nGrade:\nFreshman\nName:\nArix\nTraining Program:\nGravity\nScore:\nSupergiant+\nOrtiz rubbed his eyes and looked again. He turned the virtual screen towards Bauer, doubting much, and said, \"Dude, check this out, I think my eyes are playing tricks. I didn’t know there could be a ’+’ after ’Supergiant’.\"\nBauer glanced down at the score report. Then, he looked up deeply at Arix before starting to comfort his poor colleague, \"Ortiz, it’s real.\"\nOrtiz’s legs trembled. Thankfully, Bauer was there to steady him, preventing any embarrassment in front of his student.\n\"Sir, if there’s nothing else, I’ll head out now,\" Arix felt the instructors were acting a bit weird, but whether it was good or bad, she figured it was best to slip away.\n\"No, there’s something. You’re coming with me to another training center now,\" Ortiz said with eyes fixed on Arix, his tone utterly serious.\n’Is this a special extra lesson for me?’\nArix raised an eyebrow.\nThen, she thought about waiting for Drexel and plus, she was also curious about the other training centers. So, she nodded and agreed, \"Alright.\"\n\"Bauer, keep an eye on the students,\" Ortiz told Bauer. Then he led Arix to the first Hypnosis Training Center.\nHypnosis is about using one’s psychic power to invade someone else’s psychic world, thereby hypnotizing their consciousness.\nThe training aims to strengthen one’s willpower and increase the chances of resisting invasions by others’ psychic powers.\nThe only caution in this training is that the invader’s psychic power level must not be lower than the invaded’s, or else it could lead to a severe backlash.\nAs soon as Ortiz and Arix entered the hypnosis room, they saw a captain talking with the hypnosis center instructor.\n\"Pritchett, got a moment? Help me test a student,\" Ortiz casually called out.\n\"Sure, come on over.\" Pritchett was amiable, always ready to help a colleague.\n\"Okay...\" Ortiz hadn’t noticed the man next to Pritchett at first. But after a brief glance, his next words got stuck in his throat.\n’Damn, why is Kellan’s rival here? Is it too late to take Arix back now?’\nOrtiz thought despairingly. He quietly moved to shield Arix behind him, trying to hide.\nOrtiz swallowed and averted his eyes, saying, \"Captain Cantet, what brings you here?\"\n\"Just here for some business with Pritchett. What about you, you came here to give this student some extra training?\" Cantet said teasingly, raising an eyebrow—it was clear he noticed Ortiz’s attempt to shield.\nHe was curious to see what Ortiz was up to.\nOrtiz stumbled over his words for a moment. Then, as if suddenly remembering something urgent, he blurted out, \"Ah, I just remembered I have another thing to do. Pritchett, I’ll test this tomorrow. Sorry, Captain, I have to go now.\"\nHe turned and immediately tried to pull Arix away, but Cantet’s leisurely voice halted them in their tracks.\n\"Wait a second,\" Cantet said. He walked up to Ortiz and Arix, giving Arix a careful look.\nSquinting and stroking his chin, he asked nonchalantly, \"This young lady looks like she’s Kellan’s sister, right?\"\n’No!’\nOrtiz was about to object when Arix spoke up behind him.\n\"You know my brother?\" Arix asked, curious.\nOrtiz knew he should contact Kellan immediately. Just as he slightly raised his wrist equipped with an optic computer, however, Cantet saw through his intentions. Smiling, he placed a hand on Ortiz’s shoulder.\nCantet turned and warned Ortiz with a glance. Then, turning back to Arix with a smile, he said, \"Yes, your brother and I learn lessons from each other often.\"\nHearing this, Ortiz opened his mouth but ended up covering his face, saying nothing.\nCantet was known for his sugar-coated barbs, a fact acknowledged by everyone in the fifth legion. Only he could make regular brawls sound so elegant and refined.\n\"You’re a friend of my brother? I’m Arix,\" she said politely.\n\"Good, are you here for a test today? Let me help you, and I think Kellan would be very glad.\" Cantet’s smile was disarming, but his mind was already plotting to hypnotize the girl and dig up some dirt on his rival.\n\"Thank you, that’s very kind,\" Arix, seeing the guy dressed in her military uniform, dropped down all her guards. With her instructor present, she never imagined that the man in front of her was a wolf in sheep’s clothing.\n\"Here, sit down and close your eyes,\" Cantet instructed Arix to sit in a special chair. He eagerly extended his psychic power into the psychic space of Arix’s mind, attempting to hypnotize her consciousness.\nHowever, as soon as Cantet’s psychic power neared Arix’s consciousness, a massive psychic force erupted from within her psychic world, instantly striking back at Cantet’s psychic world.\nThud...\nThe sound of a body hitting the floor startled Arix awake. She opened her eyes to see her brother’s \"good friend\" lying on the ground.\nThe room was soon filled with medical personnel, but they weren’t there for Arix. Instead, they carried away Captain Cantet.\nPritchett, the instructor, concerned for Cantet, followed them out.\nIn the end, only Arix and Ortiz remained in the vast hypnosis room, staring at each other in an awkward silence.\nAfter a long pause, Arix cautiously ventured, \"Sir, what if I say I did nothing and he just passed out by himself? Do you believe me?\"\n\"Arix, do you know that Captain Cantet’s psychic power is Supergiant-Class? Even he suffered backlash,\" Ortiz stared intensely at Arix. He then delivered a striking question, \"So, how powerful is your psychic power, exactly?\"\nArix hesitated, then murmured softly, \"Can I choose to keep that a secret?\"\nOrtiz looked at Arix with mixed emotions and finally closed his eyes and waved his hand.\n\"Sir, does this mean I can go? Are we not testing anymore?\" Arix asked, looking both pitiful and innocent.\n\"Go ahead, we’re not testing today. Or do you want to send another captain to the medical center?\" Ortiz replied, glaring at Arix with irritation.\n\"Okay, thank you, sir. Goodbye!\" Arix said, then scampered off as if on fire.\nToday she had truly learned what it meant to have a fleeting thrill that could lead to severe consequences. Sending an officer to the medical center? It inevitably meant her parents might get called.\nAnd that was what Arix found most mortifying.\nHowever, it seemed that Instructor Ortiz was intending to help clean up the mess for her, which touched Arix deeply.\nShe wished all the best for the poor captain, and the kind Ortiz.",

Arix must be my jinx. Every time I run into her, something bad happens.\"\n\"What happened now? Did you land her in the medical center again?\" Bauer asked curiously, as if it was to be expected.\n\"No, this time she sent someone else there,\" Ortiz said, sounding sad but oddly proud.\n\"Who?\" Bauer asked, surprised.\nAs soon as he mentioned it, Ortiz’s face fell. He wiped his face and mumbled, \"Captain Cantet, Kellan Kering’s arch-rival.\"\nCantet and Kellan were the top contenders for the next Rear Admiral. Their rivalry was well-known throughout the Fifth Legion.\nBauer’s mouth twitched as he gave Ortiz a thumbs up. He said sarcastically, \"When it comes to courting disaster, you’re the best, Ortiz. You just might have offended two future Rear Admirals.\"\nOrtiz cursed inwardly, \"Damn, you think I wanted this? Who knew Captain Cantet would show up at the training base today, and just happen to go to the psychic training area, and of all places, the hypnotism chamber. And just at that moment, he runs into Arix.\"\nToday was just one unlucky coincidence after another, like someone meticulously planned it all out.\nBauer thought of something and muttered, \"Do you really think Arix’s psychic power is only Supergiant-Class?\"\n\"What do you think?\" Ortiz gave Bauer a look that said ’Figure it out for yourself.’\nBauer instantly understood his friend’s point. He said thoughtfully, \"The Alliance has a bright future.\"\n\"The Alliance might have a bright future, but mine is bleak for now. I don’t even know if I can smooth this over,\" Ortiz said with a gloomy face.\n\"Why not tell her big brother?\" Bauer felt it was better not to get involved in fights between big shots.\n\"No way!\" Ortiz immediately objected. With a heroic expression, he declared, \"I’ll protect my student myself. What would it look like if I ran to a student’s parents when facing trouble?\"\nBauer rolled his eyes and said, \"Good luck then.\"\n...\nWhen Cantet was sent to the Fifth Legion’s hospital, Kellan had already received the news. He immediately had his aide look into the situation, and when Kellan learned the truth, he burst out laughing.\nHis rival had really embarrassed himself.\n\"Captain, do you think Captain Cantet might make things difficult for Miss Kering? Should we keep an eye on the training base?\" Kellan’s aide, Basell, asked.\n\"No need, Cantet likes to set traps for people, but he’s basically honest. I didn’t expect that this time, trying to set a trap for me, he’d fall into it himself,\" Kellan said, and laughed again.\nAs soon as Basell heard this, he laughed along, \"It’s a good thing Miss Kering is so capable.\"\n\"Capable or not, she’s still just a kid. Alright, let’s stop talking about them,\" Kellan said with a laugh.\nHe looked at the virtual map of the Alliance on his desk, his expression turning serious. \"Basell, let’s talk about the insectoids. I have a feeling they’ve been unusually active lately.\"\nBasell looked at the map, covered with planets large and small, and zoomed in on the eastern section.\nThen he said, \"You’re right. Lately, the insectoids seem to be targeting the Fifth Legion. The Fifth Legion’s area of responsibility on the Alliance border has seen the most insectoid activity. And recently, a wormhole appeared in Hecaris. I’m afraid they’re up to something big this time.\"\nKellan thought for a moment, then suddenly asked, \"Is there any news from the Empire?\"\n\"Miss Kering saved their crown prince this time. Alpha Leonidas was originally a warmonger, but he has changed quite a bit. He probably won’t plan to wage war against the Alliance for the time being,\" Basell said, ending with praise, \"All thanks to Miss Kering, the Alliance was helped a lot without deploying a single soldier.\"\nKellan smiled as he listened to Basell. He said, \"The best outcome is for the Empire and the Alliance to coexist peacefully. Our ancestors fled from Earth during the apocalypse; without the help of the Empire, the original inhabitant country, there would be no Alliance today.\"\nBasell listened quietly to Kellan’s words and didn’t respond. Matters like these were global in scope, and while a captain had the right to comment, he did not have the right to participate.\nKellan understood why Basell remained silent. He didn’t continue about the Empire and changed the subject, \"I’ll ask my father to pay more attention to the insectoid issue. That’s all for today, you can go now.\"\n\"Yes, captain,\" Basell said. Then he turned and left Kellan’s office.\nKellan sat back in his chair and rubbed his temples, \"I always feel like something bad is going to happen. I hope it’s just my imagination.\"\nMeanwhile, Arix had just walked out of the psychic training area. She was planning to enjoy the scenery outside while waiting for Drexel, when Instructor Pritchett called her back.\n\"Arix, come with me. The legion’s investigative team has some questions about Captain Cantet, and please put on this bracelet,\" Pritchett said gently.\nHe handed her a simple bracelet.\nArix thought it was Captain Cantet who had reported her to the legion’s investigative team, and this bracelet was like handcuffs. After putting it on, she said weakly, \"It’s on.\"\nArix followed Pritchett out of the training base, heading towards an increasingly secluded area. That’s when she realized something might be wrong.\n\"Sir, are we going the right way?\" Arix asked warily, suspecting that Cantet might be seeking revenge.\n\"Don’t worry, we haven’t gone the wrong way. Actually, we’re already here,\" Pritchett’s mouth curled into a sinister arc, his normally clear blue and white eyes gradually turning into all-black compound eyes.\n\"You’re an insectoid! You’ve parasitized Instructor Pritchett!\" Arix exclaimed, her pupils constricting in shock.\nArix was about to summon her psychic powers for defense, but she found that her usually responsive psychic power now seemed as if it were asleep.\n\"Save your energy. The bracelet on your hand was crafted from the finest materials to restrain psychic powers. You’re the first one to use it. Don’t you feel honored?\" Pritchett, with his compound eyes, looked at Arix and sneered evilly.\nArix gave up on using her psychic power and turned to run. But she had only taken a few steps when she realized she was surrounded by a psychic barrier.\nSeeing no escape, Arix faced the parasitized Pritchett and asked, \"What exactly do you want to do?\"\n\"What do I want to do? I am of course going to take you back to serve as a breeding vessel for our great future Queen,\" Pritchett replied.\nThen, without wasting more words and with a cruel, bloodthirsty expression, the insectoid advanced toward Arix.",

Instead, a smirk crept onto her lips as she sneered, \"Bugs are just bugs, after all. Not too bright, are you? If you get another chance, make sure to kill me first, or you’ll be the one to die.\"\nArix’s right hand, the one without the bracelet, gently touched her left elbow. Then, she twisted it fiercely.\nRIP!\nArix grunted in pain as blood dripped from her left elbow to the ground.\nPritchett’s pupils dilated in shock, staring in disbelief as Arix tore off her own arm. She even left the bracelet intact, taunting him as it dangled before his eyes.\n\"Guess I’ll need to carry a surgical knife next time,\" Arix muttered, casting a pained glance at her severed arm. She then turned and shot Pritchett a vicious grin. \"Now, who’s the prey now?\"\n\"How did you...\" Pritchett realized the danger and tried to flee.\nBut Arix, ever vengeful, didn’t give him the chance. Her psychic power, long prepared, erupted and wrapped Pritchett in a crushing grip.\nArix slowly walked up to Pritchett. She then reached out, and tore off his left arm as well.\n\"Ah! You crazy woman! If you’re going to kill me, just do it!\" Pritchett howled in agony.\n\"Kill you? Why would I waste such a valuable specimen?\" Arix sneered. \"Rest assured, I’ll make sure the research institute keeps you alive, suffering for eternity.\"\nWith that, she used her psychic power to seal the blood vessels in her wound. She tucked her severed arm under her armpit and dragged Pritchett back to the training base.\nAs she walked, she muttered, \"I wonder if my arm can be reattached later. Should I clone a new one instead? But that’s so expensive.\"\nListening to Arix, Pritchett spat out a mouthful of blood in fury and fainted.\nArix noticed he had become heavier. She rolled her eyes, and muttered, \"This guy? And he thinks he can be a spy?\"\n...\nDrexel was the first to notice Arix’s disappearance. He had just finished his training and emerged from the psychic power training field, only to find Arix missing. He nearly lost his mind with worry.\nHe couldn’t bear to imagine what would happen to their family if Arix couldn’t be found.\nWhile Drexel was still frantically searching, the high-ranking officers of the Fifth Legion and the training base also received the news. They were thrown into a frenzy.\nArix was the only one in the Alliance with psychic power at Supergiant+ level. After returning to the Kering family, she had been hailed by many as the future hope of the Alliance.\nIf she was lost forever, it would not only devastate the Kering family but also deliver a heavy blow to the entire Alliance.\nWhile everyone frantically searched for Arix, she was already on her way back, gasping for breath as she dragged Pritchett along like a dead pig.\nAfter a few more steps, she paused and eyed Pritchett’s limbs, contemplating whether to disassemble him to lighten the load.\nJust as she was about to make her move, an Alliance soldier suddenly emerged from the bushes.\nArix looked warily at the stranger, fearing that he might be another insectoid. If so, there was no way she could make it back.\nThankfully, the soldier simply opened his opticomputer and compared her face to a photo on his screen.\nAfter confirming her identity, he touched the earpiece in his ear and said, \"Jerboa, Jerboa, this is Antelope, do you copy? I’ve located the target in the woods on the back hill. The target is injured and requires medical assistance, over.\"\n\"Roger that, Antelope. Please stand by. Support is on the way, over,\" a male voice responded through the earpiece.\n\"Roger, over,\" the soldier replied before turning to Arix. \"Miss Kering, the medic and captain are on their way. Just hang on for a little while.\"\n\"Alright,\" Arix relaxed, realizing this stranger was an ally.\nShe glanced at Pritchett and let go in disgust, dropping him to the ground, where he landed face-first in the dirt.\nNot long after, a warship descended on the scene. Kellan and Drexel disembarked with fifty soldiers.\nArix stood covered in blood, missing one arm. That made the entire group surround her with concern.\n\"Arix, we’re so worried about you!\" Kellan’s tension finally released at the sight of her.\n\"Arix, what happened to your arm? How did you end up like this?\" Drexel asked.\nSeeing her two caring brothers, Arix no longer pretended to be strong. She immediately wailed, \"It hurts so much! It’s all this damn insectoid’s fault!\"\nFollowing Arix’s finger, Kellan and Drexel saw Pritchett lying on the ground, barely alive. Kellan’s gaze turned sharp, while Drexel, filled with rage, rushed forward and started pummeling Pritchett like a punching bag.\n\"Dare to hurt my sister? Go to hell!\" Drexel kept raining blows on him.\nPritchett was beaten awake. Realizing the dire situation he was in, he quickly begged for mercy, \"Stop, stop! I’ll tell you everything, okay?\"\nSeeing that Drexel was about to beat Pritchett senseless, Arix hurriedly intervened, \"Drexel, don’t kill him! I still want to send him to the research institute.\"\nKellan looked at his unruly siblings with a headache, though he didn’t seem inclined to stop them. He wanted to spoil them just this once.\n\"Arix, you’re still injured. Go back and receive treatment. I’ll handle things here,\" Kellan said warmly.\n\"Alright. Just make sure you send him to the research institute,\" Arix urged.\n\"Got it,\" Kellan replied with a resigned smile.\nSatisfied, Arix climbed onto the stretcher, cradling her severed arm, and two Alliance soldiers lifted her into the warship.\n...\nThe fact that their instructor had been parasitized by the insectoid triggered shockwaves between the two bases, and the higher-ups of the Fifth Legion were furious. The insectoid’s recent kidnapping of Arix not only crossed the Fifth Legion’s line but also the Alliance’s.\nAfter learning of the incident, the Alliance President immediately issued three orders to the Fifth Legion:\nClear out the remnants at the training base to ensure the safety of the students.\nFight back against the insectoid invasion at all costs.\nGrant the Student Officer rank to Arix Kering from the Hecaris Military Academy.\nFollowing the president’s commands, several individuals disappeared overnight from the Fifth Legion’s training base. Some were janitors, some were instructors, and others were just assistants.\nThose who were aware of the disappearances kept silent. Even if they happened to stumble across an arrest in progress, they would just turn and walk away as if they had seen nothing.\nThe ones who got the shortest end of the stick in this purge were the spies sent by the Empire’s warmongers. They had only just been embedded in the training base and hadn’t even begun their operations before they were caught.\n...\nUnaware of the turmoil outside, Arix had just reattached her arm and wrapped a bandage around her neck. She was relaxing comfortably on her hospital bed, engrossed in a livestream on her opticomputer.\nThe streamer was a Moon-Class mecha engineer who was meticulously explaining the finer points of building Moon-Class mechas. The more Arix listened, the more captivated she became, occasionally tipping the streamer.\n\"Thank you, MechaMonster, for the feather! Appreciate the support.\"\n\"Thanks for the sports car, MechaMonster!\"\n\"Thanks for the castle!\"\nThe streamer was grinning from ear to ear. While explaining the mecha assembly process, he made a point to ask Arix (aka MechaMonster) if she had any questions.\nArix had many uncertainties, so she typed her questions, and the streamer eagerly answered each one.\nOnce enlightened, Arix was generous with her money. She immediately sent ten castles in a row. The stream was instantly flooded with spectacular effects from the high-value gifts.\nAfter finishing her gifts, Arix glanced at the time and followed the streamer before reluctantly logging out of the app.\nKellan was supposed to bring her food soon, and she couldn’t let him see the opticomputer in the room.\nKnock, knock!\nJust as Arix closed the app, there was a knock on the door, causing her to hastily tuck her hands under the blanket.",

      "content": "Chapter 45: Master Chemist\n\"Arix, I’ve brought your meal,\" Kellan said as he rapped on the door twice. Opening the door, he walked in carrying two bags.\n\"You’re here! What are we having today?\" Arix asked with an innocent smile. Meanwhile, her hands moved deftly beneath the blanket to detach the opticomputer and sneakily tuck it under her pillow.\nThis was the only opticomputer Drexel had managed to smuggle into the training base after much effort. Arix had to return it once Drexel was done with his classes, so if Kellan discovered and confiscated it, she’d have no way to explain herself to Drexel.\n\"There’s your favorite fruit pudding and some ice cream cake,\" Kellan said as he set up the small table on the hospital bed, placing the pudding on it.\nArix eagerly took a spoonful of pudding before glancing curiously at the other box in Kellan’s hand. \"Is there someone else you’re delivering food to?\"\nKellan looked at the remaining box and smiled mysteriously. \"Yes, I’m bringing some food to a good friend.\"\nArix paused mid-bite, scratching her head awkwardly. \"You mean Captain Cantet, don’t you?\"\n\"That’s right,\" Kellan replied warmly, a hint of amusement in his tone.\n\"Is he okay? I heard psychic injuries can be tricky,\" Arix asked softly, a bit guilty.\n\"He’s fine, just a minor psychic world concussion. A few days of rest, and he’ll be discharged,\" Kellan replied, recognizing her guilt and giving her a reassuring pat on the head.\nA psychic world concussion was similar to a regular concussion and would heal with proper rest.\nRelieved to learn she hadn’t caused Cantet serious harm, Arix said, \"I’m fine here, go check on Captain Cantet.\"\n\"Alright. Finish your meal and get some rest. Just leave the dishes to the side; I’ll have a medical robot collect them later,\" Kellan instructed.\n\"Got it,\" Arix nodded obediently.\nKellan affectionately ruffled Arix’s hair before grabbing the box and leaving the room.\nAs soon as Kellan was gone, Arix immediately pulled out the opticomputer from under her pillow. She quickly opened a mecha master’s livestream and watched intently while munching on her pudding.\nMeanwhile, Kellan stepped out of Arix’s room and knocked on the door of the adjacent one.\n\"Who’s there?\" Cantet sat up, leaning against the headboard and massaging his still-swollen temples.\n\"It’s me, Kellan,\" Kellan’s gentle voice came from the hallway.\nCantet raised an eyebrow in mild surprise. He straightened his posture, and checked himself out.\nHe felt satisfied that he still looked as dashing as ever.\n\"Come in,\" he said finally.\nKellan opened the door, carrying the box as he smiled at Cantet. \"You haven’t had lunch yet, right? I brought you some pudding.\"\n\"You actually have the time to bring me food specifically?\" Cantet raised an eyebrow skeptically, feeling like there was a catch.\nPeople often said he had a dark heart, but he knew the sly fox standing in front of him was the real deal. Some people had even been tricked by Kellan only to thank him afterward.\nKellan set down the food. His lips curled into a slight smile as he said, \"I came to the hospital to bring Arix some food and thought I’d bring you some as well.\"\n\"Arix is in the hospital too?\" Cantet couldn’t believe it at first.\nGiven Arix’s formidable psychic power, it was far more likely she’d put others in the hospital. Cantet himself was her first victim, so he had no reason to doubt that.\nThe smile on Kellan’s face vanished. With a touch of sorrow in his eyes, he said, \"Cantet, Pritchett is gone.\"\nCantet paused, the spoon hovering over his pudding. He looked up and fixed his gaze on Kellan, his voice tinged with fury. \"What happened? I was only asleep for a day, and now he’s just gone?\"\nPritchett had always been the kind of kind-hearted man who felt like a big brother to many in the Fifth Legion. Almost every new recruit who joined had once received his kindness.\nCantet had enlisted in the same group as Pritchett and had been the one to receive the most care from him.\nKellan gave a brief overview of the events. \"He was parasitized by an insectoid, which aimed to kidnap the only Supergiant+ in the Alliance. Yesterday, my sister caught him, losing an arm in the process.\"\n\"Insectoid! Those insectoids again!\" Cantet’s eyes grew bloodshot, his voice seething with anger.\n\"Cantet, it’s now locked up in the quarantine zone. Tomorrow, the Alliance’s Military Research Institute will take it away. Go see Pritchett one last time today and say goodbye,\" Kellan said as he raised his right hand to grip Cantet’s shoulder, trying to offer some comfort.\n\"I understand. You go ahead,\" Cantet said, closing his eyes. At that moment, he didn’t want to see anyone else.\n\"Okay, I’m heading off now. Eat up and get some rest,\" Kellan said before leaving the room, giving Cantet some space to calm down on his own.\nCantet only looked up at the pudding on the table when he heard the door close. With a self-mocking smile, he muttered, \"Kellan, what you’ve given me isn’t a dessert; it’s the bitterest thing in the world.\"\nElsewhere, Arix had just finished her meal and was about to lie down for a nap when she heard the door open.\nShe glanced up, puzzled. When she saw who it was, she immediately jumped up, terrified. Her voice trembled as she said, \"Captain Cantet, why are you here?\"\n’Oh no, Captain Cantet! Is he here to settle accounts with me?’\nshe wondered silently.\nCantet looked down, his gaze falling on Arix’s arm in a sling. His eyes lowered slightly, and then he spoke with a touch of pride and aloofness, \"I heard you caught Pritchett yesterday?\"\nArix nodded in confusion.\n\"Got it. Thanks. At least you’ve let everyone know he was being controlled by the insectoid and wasn’t responsible for those actions. Everyone believes he’s innocent,\" Cantet said. He didn’t wait for her reaction but simply closed the door and left.\nArix scratched the back of her head, bewildered. But seeing he had left, she didn’t think much of it and lay back down.\nThe door opened again the next second, and Arix looked up to find Cantet back. She sat up, exasperated. \"What else do you need?\"\n’Can’t you just say everything at once? You’re going to give me a heart attack!’\nshe complained inwardly but didn’t dare speak aloud.\n\"Oh, I forgot to mention earlier. Please tell your brother that the pudding was nice, but don’t send it again,\" Cantet said before closing the door and walking away.\nFor a moment, the air hung in silence, and then Arix muttered a curse. She got up, locked the door to her hospital room, and finally returned to bed.\nLetting out a sigh of relief, she settled in for a peaceful nap.\nAfter her nap, Arix got up with a yawn. After freshening up, she planned to visit the mecha repair department, something she had requested permission to do yesterday.\nExcitedly, Arix put on her training uniform and left the hospital room, heading toward the repair department. As she passed the Chemistry Department, she couldn’t resist peeking in for a quick look. But she was immediately called over by an older man in a lab coat.\n\"You’re the chemist assigned to help us from headquarters, right? What are you doing standing around like that? Get in here!\" Sims called out, his tone tinged with slight disappointment.\nArix froze and looked around, pointing to herself in confusion. \"Are you talking to me?\"\n\"Who else would it be?\" Sims looked at Arix, puzzled, wondering how headquarters could send over someone who was both injured and clueless.\n\"Well, I don’t—\" Arix began to protest but was dragged by the older man straight into the Chemistry Department.\n\"No time for chit-chat. Do you have any idea how many soldiers on the front lines are depending on our potions to save their lives? Stop dawdling!\" Sims scolded angrily.\nHearing this, Arix stopped arguing, letting out a sigh as she was pulled deeper into the department.\nInside, Arix saw the chemists hard at work, just as Sims had described. They were busy brewing potions, and even the assistants were rushing around with focused faces, quickly and accurately delivering materials to each chemist in their individual labs.\n\"This is your room. Today, your task is to brew at least 500 advanced insect repellent potions and 500 advanced healing potions. If you need any materials, call Assistant 30, and he’ll get them for you,\" Sims instructed before rushing off.\nArix stood alone in a lab full of materials. She took a moment to shake off her confusion before finally beginning to handle the supplies.\nBoth the insect repellent and healing potions were Planet-Class. Arix had already practiced brewing them multiple times in the month after her exams.\nSo she was comfortable with the process, but the sheer volume required was overwhelming. And the fact that one of her arms was practically useless only made the job harder.\nArix sighed.\nAfter her sigh, Arix focused on the task of brewing the potions. She crushed the required ingredients and placed them into a test tube, letting them simmer for the necessary amount of time.\nOnce the mixture was ready, she carefully extracted the liquid and used her psychic power to separate the impurities.\nNext, she took several other similarly treated extracts and blended them in a specific order.\nFinally, she poured the finished liquid into a potion vial and sealed it.\nOne insect repellent potion was complete.\nCrushing, simmering, extracting, purifying, blending, and bottling... For the rest of the afternoon, Arix found herself repeating these six steps continuously. The pile of finished potions at her feet steadily grew.\nSims occasionally passed by and, seeing Arix diligently at work, nodded in approval. He picked up one of her potions, placed a drop on his fingertip, and sniffed it. Afterward, he let the liquid touch his tongue, closing his eyes as he took his time to taste it.\nThen, all of a sudden, Sims’ eyes flew open, and he looked at Arix in astonishment.\nThere seemed to be no impurities in this potion—or so few that it was undetectable by human examination.\nSims cast a deep, thoughtful glance at Arix before taking the potion to the testing room for a more thorough analysis.",

      "content": "Chapter 46: Twist Upon Twist\nNot long after Sims left, Arix finally finished brewing all the potion materials.\n\"Phew!\" Arix sighed in relief, looking at all the potions covering the floor. She glanced out the window, seeing a sky painted crimson by the sunset, indicating twilight had arrived.\nBy now, Drexel’s training must have wrapped up, and she was probably waiting for Arix in her hospital room.\nAfter tidying herself up a bit, Arix quietly left the Chemistry Department without drawing any attention.\nIn the testing room, Sims placed the potion he had taken from Arix into a specialized potion analyzer and pressed the start button. The indicator light came on, and a 3D screen lit up above the analyzer, showing a line of text indicating the potion was being tested.\nTen seconds later, a soft \"ding\" signaled that the test had finished, and lines of results slowly appeared on the screen.\nPotion Name: Planet-Class Potion for Healing\nPurity: 99.99%\nEfficacy Utilization Rate: 100%\nImpurity Retention Rate: 0.01%\nQuality Rating: 100/100\nSims stared intently at the results. He rubbed his eyes a few times to make sure he hadn’t misread them.\n\"This little girl is an absolute prodigy for potion-making, with a bright future ahead!\" Sims praised as he stroked his beard, nodding in approval.\nAfter a moment of admiration, Sims grabbed the potion and set off to find Arix. He wanted to ask her if she needed a mentor.\nHe was a renowned Master Chemist, a top figure in the Alliance’s Chemistry field, and he had no problem thickening his skin to recommend himself.\nThe more Sims thought about it, the more delightful the idea seemed, and he was already envisioning Arix as his student.\nIt looked like he would have a new apprentice after today.\nFeeling elated, Sims headed to Arix’s brewing room, only to find it empty.\n\"30, where’s the young lady that was here?\" Sims asked, a little stunned.\nA sense of foreboding washed over him.\n’Has my future prized apprentice have flown away?’\n\"Not sure. I haven’t seen her in a while,\" Assistant 30 replied, equally puzzled.\n\"How can you not know where she went?\" Sims’s anger was on the verge of exploding when he suddenly heard an apologetic voice behind him.\n\"Master Sims, I’m sorry. The spaceship over at Ceres had a malfunction, so I had to wait for the next one to arrive,\" said a polite young man, clearly embarrassed as he approached Sims.\n\"And who are you?\" Sims asked, bewildered.\n\"Ah, I forgot to introduce myself. I’m Grantham. Headquarters sent me to the Fifth Legion as support. I’m a Star-Class chemist,\" Grantham said with a courteous smile.\n\"You...!\" Sims’ eyes widened as he pointed a trembling finger at Grantham, his face shifting between shades of pale and flushed.\nIt wasn’t until this moment that Sims suddenly recalled a few details. He remembered that the young girl initially seemed hesitant to follow him but only did so after hearing what he said.\nIt turned out that he had gotten it wrong from the start.\nSims almost spat blood in frustration. His whole spirit seemed drained. After dismissing the two men, he wandered the Chemistry Department alone and confirmed that the young girl had already left.\n\"I got to find her. I’ll definitely take this apprentice,\" Sims said stubbornly. He opened his opticomputer and sent a communication request to his cousin’s grandson, a young man he trusted a lot.\nKellan was in his office dealing with paperwork. When he saw it was Sims, he set his pen down and asked with concern, \"Grandpa Sims, what do you need?\"\n\"Kid, I need you to help me find someone.\" Seeing Kellan’s concern, Sims felt much better.\n\"Do you know this person? Any distinguishing features?\" Kellan asked warmly.\n\"No, I don’t know her. She looks like a girl about 18 or 19, dressed in training gear and pretty adorable. Oh, right, she had her left arm in a sling,\" Sims replied after thinking for a moment.\nKellan grew increasingly silent as he listened. He finally pulled out a photograph and asked, \"Are you talking about her?\"\nSims took a close look, and then his face broke into a wrinkled grin. \"Yes, yes, that’s the girl! Kellan, how do you have her photo? Is she your girlfriend?\"\nKellan awkwardly looked at Sims and quickly explained, \"Her name is Arix Kering. Now do you know who she is?\"\nSims was stunned for a moment and then fell into an incredulous silence as he remembered, \"Arix... wait! That girl is your sister?\"\nKellan nodded firmly and said seriously, \"Yes, that’s right.\"\nSims felt both joy and anger at once. He was elated that the prodigy he had sought so diligently turned out to be his own family. He was angry that if Arix hadn’t been lost all those years ago, he could have started training her much sooner. By now, he might have made her the strongest chemist in the Alliance.\nHe told himself not to dwell on it because the thought alone made his heart ache.\n\"Are you okay?\" Kellan asked, worried as he watched Sims switch between frowning, laughing, and anger.\n\"I’m fine! I’m just happy!\" Sims growled through gritted teeth, his face twisting.\n\"...\" Kellan silently watched the old man with a look of someone ready to devour the world and dared not say a word.\n\"By the way, Kellan, where is my little Moon Pie staying now?\" Sims was so busy wallowing in regrets that he nearly forgot to ask for the address.\n\"Legion Hospital, Room 505,\" Kellan said.\n\"Alright, got it. You go ahead and take care of your business,\" Sims said, ending the video call.\nHe then prepared to head to the hospital but paused to think it over. He suddenly remembered that he had made the innocent Arix brew potions the entire afternoon. His little Moon Pie must be utterly exhausted now, so he decided to wait until tomorrow to find her.\nStill feeling somewhat guilty about mistaking her identity earlier, Sims returned to the Chemistry Department while quietly calculating his next steps.",

      "content": "Chapter 47: Back To The Ward\nAs soon as Arix returned to her hospital room, she saw Drexel half-lying on her bed, playing with the opticomputer she had hidden under her pillow.\n\"Hey, you’re back!\" Drexel greeted his sister while playing a game, glancing up as she walked in.\n\"Yeah,\" Arix replied, too tired to say much else. She grabbed her toiletries and headed to the bathroom for a quick shower. Afterward, she returned to her bedside table, took out some bandages, and replaced the sling on her left arm.\nOnce finished, Arix sat down on a chair beside her bed. She looked at Drexel, still lounging on her bed, and said softly, \"Don’t you think it’s a bit much to hog your sister’s hospital bed?\"\n\"I trained all day and haven’t rested yet. I’ll get up soon, I promise,\" Drexel replied shamelessly, showing no signs of moving.\nArix twitched her lips, knowing Drexel would definitely not get up \"soon.\" Her eyes were flat and emotionless as she gazed at him, and she said coolly, \"Kellan should be here soon with my dinner. So... are you sure you still want to lie here a little longer?\"\nDrexel’s body stiffened as he heard that. The next moment, he obediently climbed off the bed and sat on the chair, giving Arix a plaintive look. \"Other people’s sisters are sweethearts, but you’re just bitter and harsh.\"\n\"Well, other people’s brothers don’t steal their little sister’s hospital bed,\" Arix shot back with a hum as she lay down comfortably.\n\"Hmph!\" Drexel rolled his eyes at Arix. He suddenly remembered a message from his instructor, and a hint of envy crept into his voice. \"By the way, the instructor wanted me to tell you that once you’re healed and back at the training base, the military will hold a ceremony to award you a rank. You’ll also need to give a speech in front of all the faculty and students.\"\nArix sat up, bewildered. \"Wait, what? I have a rank? Are you sure?\"\n\"It’s for the merits you earned yesterday when you captured Pritchett. Plus, the rank is awarded by the president, which means you’re officially recognized by them.\" Drexel was getting more jealous with every word, his eyes nearly turning green.\n\"All this for a rank? I really don’t think I did much,\" Arix said sheepishly, scratching her head.\n\"It’s probably also because you saved people when the wormhole appeared last time. But you’re definitely famous now. Not many people get a rank before even graduating from military school,\" Drexel said, full of envy.\nHowever, he felt better when he remembered she was his sister, and he could always brag about her to his roommates later.\n\"You said I have to give a speech on stage?\" Arix asked, eyes glimmering with an idea.\n\"Yeah, the instructor told you to prepare a speech ahead of time so you don’t freeze up. But why do you ask?\" Drexel looked at her, puzzled.\nArix intended to use this opportunity to put all those pesky rumors to rest once and for all.\nThis round of rumors taught Arix one thing: human emotions, even that of siblings, don’t always align. Throughout the entire ordeal, she was the only one who felt embarrassed, while Drexel, oblivious as ever, didn’t give it a second thought.\nWith this realization, Arix looked at Drexel, her emotions tangled, and said, \"Nothing. But sometimes, I really envy how blissfully ignorant you can be.\"\n\"What?\" Drexel looked at her, bewildered and clueless as to why she was suddenly mocking him.\nJust as Drexel was about to respond, there was a knock at the door.\nKnock, knock.\n\"Arix, it’s me,\" Kellan’s voice called through the door.\nInside the room, the siblings jumped in surprise, exchanging a quick glance before springing into action.\nArix grabbed a pillow, and Drexel quickly slipped off the opticomputer from his wrist. Once the device was securely tucked beneath the pillow, they both exhaled a sigh of relief.\n\"Come in,\" Arix said, trying to sound casual.\nKellan walked in carrying a bag and immediately noticed Drexel. He frowned and asked, \"How did you get out of the training base?\"\nGenerally, freshmen weren’t allowed at the real military base.\n\"I was worried about her, so I asked the instructor for permission to visit. It worked out because the instructor also had a message for Arix,\" Drexel explained obediently.\nBut only Arix knew he had really come to retrieve his opticomputer. The miserly dude only let her borrow it because she was in the hospital.\nAfter hearing Drexel’s explanation, Kellan nodded. He moved to the bedside table and unpacked the meal, setting it up neatly. \"Today’s dinner is roast lamb and vegetable soup. How does that sound?\" he asked Arix.\n\"Sounds great, thanks,\" Arix said eagerly, her mouth practically watering. She took a quick sip of the soup.\nWatching her, Drexel couldn’t help but feel envious and looked up at Kellan with a pitiful gaze. \"Dude, is there any for me?\"\n\"What do you think?\" Kellan replied, smiling as ta turned toward Drexel.\nThis blatant favoritism made Drexel instantly feel like he was back home. He sulked in the corner, glaring but not daring to complain.\nSeeing Drexel looking so pitiful, Arix couldn’t help but scoop a small bowl of soup and pass it to him. \"Here, have some.\"\n\"At least Arix still cares about me,\" Drexel beamed, his mood instantly improving as he carefully took the bowl. He glanced at Kellan smugly and let out a satisfied hum.\nKellan shook his head, chuckling at Drexel as though he were a fool.\n\"Kellan, would you like some?\" Arix asked again.\n\"No need, I’ve already eaten,\" Kellan said with a smile. Then, he remembered something and asked Arix, \"Arix, did you go to the Chemistry Department today?\"\nArix looked up at Kellan in confusion. \"How did you know? I did go there this afternoon.\"\n\"Just curious, that’s all,\" Kellan replied. He had a pretty good idea of what had happened but not saying more. After all, it couldn’t have been anything bad.\n\"OK,\" Arix muttered. She was still a bit puzzled but not dwelling on it as she returned to her vegetable soup.",

      "content": "Chapter 48: Doctor Spears\nThe next day, Arix woke up and went through her morning routine, brushing her teeth and washing her face.\nShe carefully removed the sling to inspect her arm’s healing progress.\nOn the outside, her fair and flawless arm showed no sign of the previous injury.\nShe gently massaged it and then used a software on her opticomputer to check further.\nThe results indicated that her vitals were close to normal. However, her bones still needed some time to heal fully, so she’d have to rest for a few more days.\nMedical technology in this interstellar age was truly astonishing. In her previous life, this sort of injury would have taken months to heal, often leaving lasting effects that would make intense physical activity impossible.\nBut now, such injuries were considered minor. After reattaching her arm in surgery, they used a healing device that quickly sealed the external wounds. A few days of rest would then restore her arm inside and out, with no lingering side effects.\nThe only bittersweet feeling Arix had was that her previously learned skills in bone-setting and emergency care had almost become obsolete in this high-tech era.\nShe thought about it with mixed feelings for a moment before leaving her hospital room and heading to the clinic. Even though she’d already checked her arm’s progress herself, she still needed to follow the doctor’s orders and go for a follow-up.\nAt the clinic, she politely knocked three times. After hearing the doctor say \"Come in,\" she opened the door and walked inside.\n\"Arix, how’s your arm? Is it hurting these past two days?\" the doctor asked. He was a young man with golden hair and sharp features. Seeing Arix enter, he adjusted his glasses on the bridge of his nose and gave her a careful look.\n\"Thank you, Dr. Spears. There’s been no pain these past two days,\" Arix replied, shaking her head.\n\"Good to hear. Let’s take a scan today so I can see how it’s healing,\" Spears said, pulling out a scanner and instructing Arix to place her hand on it.\nArix obediently removed the sling and stretched her arm out straight into the scanner.\nAfter studying the data on the virtual screen for a while, Spears finally spoke, \"It’s healing well. Give it a few more days, and you’ll be back to normal training. You can even remove the sling tomorrow.\"\n\"Great, thanks, Dr. Spears. I’ll be off now,\" Arix said, reassured, as she re-secured the sling before standing up to say goodbye.\n\"Take care, and remember, no intense physical activity for a few days,\" Spears reminded her once more.\n\"Got it,\" Arix nodded before leaving the clinic, heading toward the mecha department.\nNot long after Arix left the hospital, Sims arrived at the reception desk and asked for directions to Room 505.\n\"Room 505? Are you looking for Miss Arix Kering? She’s probably not in her room right now,\" the nurse replied.\n\"Not in? Do you know where she went?\" Sims asked urgently.\n\"I’m not sure, but Miss Arix is a student in the Department of Mecha Manufacture. You might want to try looking over there,\" the nurse suggested.\n\"Got it, thanks.\" Upon hearing that Arix was in the Department of Manufacture, Sims frowned even deeper.\nHe turned and left the hospital, muttering as he walked, \"A brilliant chemistry prodigy, wasting her talent in the Department of Manufacture?\"\nThe thought of such potential in chemistry going to waste filled Sims with frustration, and he hurried toward the mecha department.\n’I must get this kid back on track.’\nMeanwhile, Arix finally reached the entrance to the military mecha department. Just as she was about to step inside, she heard a heart-wrenching cry from behind her.\nSims ran over, out of breath, and shouted as soon as he saw her, \"Arix! Wait! Don’t go in!\"\nA chill ran through Arix’s spine as she heard the desperate shout. For a moment, she felt like she was the tragic heroine of a drama, but with an elder in place of the male lead.\n\"Hello, sir. I remember you’re from the Chemistry Department. Do you need something from me?\" Arix asked, turning around and looking at Sims with a puzzled expression.\nSims finally caught his breath after running up to Arix. He took a few deep breaths to steady himself. However, as soon as Arix called him \"sir,\" his expression soured.\n\"’Sir’? I’m your grandfather’s cousin. You should call me Grandpa Sims.\"\n\"My grandfather’s cousin?\" Arix blinked, slightly stunned. She tried to recall the last family banquet but didn’t remember seeing this elderly man.\nSeeing her expression, Sims guessed she was skeptical and quickly retorted, \"Do you know Varden?\"\n\"Yes, he’s my cousin,\" Arix replied, confused as to why Sims was asking.\n\"I’m his grandfather! Your brother Kellan calls me Grandpa Sims, so what do you think you should call me?\" Sims said, straightening out his disheveled clothes with an air of mystique.\n\"Grandpa Sims?\" Arix blinked again.\n\"Yes!\" Sims answered with a grin, his face creasing into wrinkles.\n\"So, what do you need from me?\" Arix asked cautiously, suspecting that he might want to drag her off for an afternoon of potion-making practice. She really wanted to check out the mechas instead.\nShe cast a wistful look toward the Department of Mecha Manufacture, her hopes high.\nNoticing Arix’s eager look at the mecha department, Sims quickly cleared his throat to get her attention. When he was sure she was focused on him, he asked with satisfaction, \"Moon Pie, how do you feel about chemistry? Want to study it with me?\"\n\"Chemistry is great, but won’t we also learn it in class?\" Arix countered.\nSims was nearly fuming at her response. What the school taught versus what he, a Master Chemist, could offer was worlds apart.\nHe silently thought to himself,\n’Calm down, calm down, this is your Moon Pie. She’s a potion prodigy, but prodigies often think differently. They need understanding and support.’\nForcing a slightly contorted smile, he said, \"They’ll be teaching the basics at school, but you’re already so familiar with Planet-Class potions. Wouldn’t that just be a waste of time? Now let me ask you, do you want to learn potions above Star-Class?\"\nArix definitely did. However, potions above Star-Class were state secrets, and she’d never had the opportunity to learn them herself.\nWith a quick flash of inspiration, Arix turned on her charm and smiled sweetly, \"Of course I do. Can you teach me?\"\nSims finally broke into a bright smile. He coaxed, \"Teach you? Of course, I will! Whoever tries to stop me will have a problem on their hands.\"\nAnd so, with affection and smiles, the two headed to the Chemistry Department, each satisfied with the arrangement.",

      "content": "Chapter 49: Planet-Class Bath\nSims brought Arix back to the Chemistry Department, singing her praises to anyone they encountered, practically complimenting her from head to toe.\n\"Look, this is Arix. She may seem delicate, but she’s fantastic at making potions.\"\n\"Oh my, Arix is incredible! Guess what her impurity rate was for the potion she made yesterday?\"\n\"Yep, just 0.01%. Amazing, right? Even I can’t do that.\"\n\"Arix is not only pretty but also great at potion-making. I don’t know which lucky guy will marry her one day.\"\nArix felt the corners of her mouth stiffen with embarrassment, but she tried to maintain a composed appearance and played along with Sims’ overly enthusiastic flattery.\nSince Master Chemist himself had acknowledged Arix as a potion prodigy, most people sincerely believed it. Thus, her unexpected reputation as a genius chemist quickly spread throughout the entire Fifth Legion’s Chemistry Department.\nIt wasn’t until they entered Sims’ personal lab that Arix finally let out a sigh of relief. She gently suggested, \"Grandpa Sims, maybe we should be a bit more low-key next time.\"\n\"Why? Was I wrong about anything?\" Sims asked.\n\"No, it’s just...\" Arix faltered, trying to express her thoughts, but was cut off by Sims’ firm response.\n\"Moon Pie, we should always be honest and avoid pretending to be weak. If you pretend too much, you might actually become weak, and then I can’t help you.\" Sims advised earnestly.\nArix sensed something was amiss but couldn’t quite articulate it, so she just nodded obediently, \"Alright, I understand. Thank you.\"\n\"Good, that’s my Moon Pie. Now, your task this morning is to read through all five of these medicinal ingredients guides.\" Sims said, handing Arix five well-preserved but old books from his Space Button.\n\"What about this afternoon?\" Arix asked casually, holding the books.\nSims eyed Arix’s feeble physique with disdain and said, \"In the afternoon, you’ll soak in a medicinal bath to strengthen your physical power. Honestly, your physical power is really lacking.\"\n\"But I heard that once you reach the Planet Class level, taking more potions doesn’t help much,\" Arix timidly replied.\n\"That depends. In your case, the main problem is that your body’s foundation is damaged. Once it’s repaired, you’ll be able to level up at least once,\" Sims explained.\n\"I understand. You’re really impressive,\" Arix said, both genuinely admiring and trying to flatter Sims.\n\"Of course! Why else do you think they call me the Master Chemist?\" Sims replied, stroking his white beard.\nAfter reminding her a few more times, he went off to prepare the potion for her medicinal bath in the afternoon.\nArix sat in a nearby chair, carefully reading through the comprehensive guide to interstellar medicinal ingredients. When she encountered something she didn’t understand, she used the lab’s opticomputer to search the interstellarnet. When she couldn’t find answers there, she’d turn to Sims for help.\nAt this moment, her previous life’s Ph.D. in chemistry finally proved useful.\nAlthough she hadn’t seen many of the pharmaceutical materials before, the detailed introductions to the ingredients and their effects allowed her to quickly familiarize herself with them.\nShe even made notes in a small notebook whenever she found inconsistencies in the guide, like conflicting medicinal properties.\nAfter she reached the last page of the book, Sims approached her with a potion.\nHe handed Arix the nutritious fluid and cautioned her, \"I’ve told your brother that while you’re taking these medicinal baths, just drink the nutritious fluid. Now, drink this, and you can head to the bath. Remember, don’t come out until the solution has cleared.\"\n\"Okay, thanks, Grandpa Sims. Got it,\" Arix replied. Without much thought, she drank the nutritious fluid, set down her book, and walked toward the bath.\nAfter she got soaked in the tub for a while, she finally realized why Sims hadn’t wanted her to eat but instead to drink the nutritious fluid.\nThe bath felt like it was filled with countless needles, endlessly pricking Arix’s skin. Her body felt as if it were boiling in hot water, causing her intense pain and a scorching sensation.\nThankfully, she hadn’t eaten too much before this; otherwise, the pain would have made her vomit everywhere.\nArix gritted her teeth tightly and gripped the sides of the bathtub firmly. It took all her willpower to keep herself from leaping out.\n\"Why didn’t he warn me it’d hurt this much? What a liar!\"\nOutside the bathroom, Sims suddenly remembered something. He hadn’t brewed Planet Class bathing potion in ages, and he’d forgotten to remind Arix to take a painkiller before soaking in the bath.\nFeeling a little guilty, Sims rubbed his nose again, but then his attention was drawn to Arix’s notebook.\n\"What’s this?\" He picked up the notebook and glanced through it. Before long, he was completely engrossed.\n\"Brilliant! Individually, these herbs are mild, but combined, they turn potent.\"\n\"It turns out that the rare Starvine can be substituted with cheap mint.\"\n\"These two herbs may be antagonistic, but if you add sage, it neutralizes the effect and allows the medicinal properties to work at full capacity.\"\n\"Genius, genius! Why wasn’t this prodigy born into my Brant family?\"\nSims was both impressed and disheartened. He then remembered something and promptly opened the opticomputer to send a video request to Matis.\nIn no time, the 3D screen displayed Matis’s face with his signature serious expression.\n\"Sims, is everything alright?\" Matis asked.\nSims glared at him fiercely and barked, \"What do you mean, ’why’? Your granddaughter Arix is clearly a genius in chemistry, so why did you let her go to the Department of Mecha Manufacture? Isn’t that wasting her talent?\"\nMatis furrowed his brows and didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he asked, \"Is Arix with you?\"\nSims puffed out his chest and replied, \"Yes, she’s with me right now, learning about potions. Don’t change the subject! I want to know why you had her enroll in the Department of Mecha Manufacture. You need to give me a reason, or I’m not letting this go today.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 50: Arix’s Advancement\nMatis looked at Sims, who was being relentlessly persistent, with a headache. He finally began to explain, \"The president of the Hecaris Military Academy also spoke to me about this. He wanted Arix to join the Department of Chemistry.\"\n\"And? Why is she still in the Department of Mecha Manufacture?\" Sims glared at him fiercely, as though he was ready to charge over and start a fight if Matis couldn’t convince him otherwise.\n\"I asked Arix, but she isn’t willing to give up the Department of Mecha Manufacture,\" Matis replied helplessly.\nHe had watched all the footage of Arix’s entrance exams and knew she had incredible talent in chemistry.\nIf she focused on chemistry, it wouldn’t be long before the Kering family produced a Master Chemist. But he would never force Arix to do something she didn’t want to, and the same went for the rest of the Kering family.\nUpon hearing this, Sims furrowed his brow.\nIf Arix was unwilling, no amount of convincing could make a difference.\nSims rubbed his temples, frustrated. Then he waved his hand at Matis, saying, \"Fine, I’ll try persuading her again, but that’s all I’ll say about it.\"\n\"Alright, thank you,\" Matis replied with a slight smile.\nSims ended the video call and looked at the bathroom, scratching his head and wondering how to communicate with that stubborn girl.\nHe couldn’t bear to threaten her, and he didn’t have the heart to shout. He sighed and thought he would try gentle persuasion first.\nNot long after, Arix came out of the bathroom, looking like a little girl who had her candy stolen, upset and faintly angry.\n\"Why didn’t you warn me it would hurt that much? I had no mental preparation for it at all,\" she grumbled.\n\"Uh...\" Sims froze and awkwardly cleared his throat. Trying to remain calm, he explained, \"It’s normal for first-time experience; it won’t be like that next time. I didn’t tell you so you wouldn’t worry.\"\n\"Really?\" Arix was still skeptical and sensed something was off.\nNoticing that she hadn’t fully bought his story, Sims quickly changed the topic. \"How are you feeling? Does your physical power seem improved?\"\nAt the mention of this, Arix forgot everything else. Her face lit up with excitement. \"I think my physical power is at the peak of the Planet Class! Soon, I’ll definitely reach Star Class!\"\n\"Good, good. This is just the beginning. Once you’ve finished all your medicinal baths, you’ll be close to the Subgiant Class, if not there already,\" Sims replied with a beaming smile.\n\"Thank you,\" Arix said, brimming with joy. She had been stressed about her physical power, but now that worry was barely noticeable.\nShe now had more time to focus on what she really wanted to do.\nSeeing Arix so happy, Sims probed cautiously, \"I heard you’re still in the Department of Mecha Manufacture. Since you’ve learned chemistry from me, why not transfer to the Department of Chemistry?\"\n\"No,\" Arix refused outright.\nSims held back his frustration and tried to maintain a kind expression. \"Why not? With your talent in chemistry, isn’t it a waste not to specialize in it?\"\nArix scratched her head. Matis had asked her about switching departments earlier, and she had refused then too. But she hadn’t explained fully.\n\"It won’t go to waste because I won’t give up either mecha or chemistry. I’ll be studying both,\" Arix clarified.\nShe had planned to include both the Department of Chemistry and the Department of Psychic Ware when classes resumed. Her interest in the Department of Psychic Ware stemmed from a wild idea she had: she wanted to use the principles of psychic healing to develop similar potions.\nCurrently, the Alliance had no way to address psychic health issues other than through the expensive Psychic Wares, leaving many to suffer and die.\nEach year, hundreds of thousands in the Alliance died from psychic power outbreaks, poisoning, or psychic world collapse. Even the lucky survivors often ended up as patients worse off than ordinary people.\nMost affected were military personnel, and since Arix’s family was full of soldiers, she was determined to find a cure to break the cycle of waiting for death.\nArix wasn’t just motivated by the Alliance’s needs; she was also driven by her own resolve.\nIf the old Arix had had access to Psychic Ware, she might not have died from a psychic-destroying potion.\nSo, the new Arix vowed to develop an affordable psychic healing potion that would prevent the tragedy from repeating.\nWith this resolve, her gaze became more determined.\nThough Sims didn’t entirely agree with Arix’s ideas, he didn’t object either.\nHe disagreed because he felt her work in mecha was a waste of time. But he wouldn’t oppose it because everyone deserved a chance to pursue their youthful dreams. Denying her this opportunity would be like clipping a bird’s wings and locking it in a cage.\nFinally, Sims sighed and said, \"I support you. Go do whatever you want to do.\"\n\"Mm, thank you,\" Arix replied, assuming Sims supported her research into psychic healing. It was a beautiful misunderstanding.\nFor the next three days, Arix practically lived in the Chemistry Department, only leaving to sleep.\nShe spent her mornings learning about various medicinal ingredients and spent her afternoons soaking in the body-refining baths.\nAfter finishing the final medicinal bath, her physical power had reached the peak of Star Class. Now, with just a bit more physical training, she would naturally progress to Subgiant Class.\nOn the fourth day, Arix finally committed to memory all the medicinal ingredients in the book.\nWith a confident stride, Arix approached Sims, who was busy preparing medicine, and said with a smile, \"I’ve read through them all.\"\nSims picked up a jar from the shelf, fully focused as he asked, \"Alright, let me quiz you. What is the purpose of elderberry?\"\nArix answered seriously, \"Elderberry is a common herb often used to relieve cold and flu symptoms. It’s rich in antioxidants, helps boost the immune system, reduces inflammation, and may also help ease coughing and nasal congestion.\"\nSims nodded and continued, \"What about mint?\"\nWithout hesitation, Arix replied, \"Mint is famous for its refreshing taste and pain-relieving properties. It can help with headaches, indigestion, and nausea, and is widely used in aromatherapy to relieve stress.\"\n\"And how would you treat underarm odor and athlete’s foot?\" Sims abruptly shifted topics, asking a question about a home remedy.\nAfter a brief pause, Arix answered, \"Underarm odor can be alleviated with tea tree oil or apple cider vinegar. Diluted tea tree oil can be applied with a cotton swab, or diluted apple cider vinegar can be used to wipe the underarm area, which helps reduce body odor.\"\nSims chuckled and asked, \"What about athlete’s foot?\"\nArix confidently stated, \"Soaking the feet in a mix of vinegar and water can inhibit fungal growth. Foot care products containing tea tree oil can also effectively relieve athlete’s foot.\"\nSims continued to ask many more questions about medicinal ingredients, and Arix was able to answer them all, demonstrating a broad understanding of their uses.\nSims couldn’t be happier, and even his gaze toward Arix carried pride.\nWith a solemn tone, Sims said, \"Excellent. Arix, remember this: a healer might not be an expert in chemistry, but to create potions that cure diseases, one must be skilled in medical science. If a chemist lacks knowledge of medicine, they’ll never reach their full potential.\"\n\"Yes, I understand,\" Arix nodded.\n\"Today, I’ll give you a hands-on lesson in crafting a Star-Class potion. Later, I’ll send videos of previous Star-Class and higher potions to your opticomputer. You can study them slowly once you’re officially in school,\" Sims said, walking over to the preparation station to begin handling the herbs.\n\"Alright,\" Arix said before watching Sims’ actions intently.\nThe main difference between Star-Class and Planet-Class or lower potions lies in both the ingredients and the crafting techniques.\nStar-Class ingredients go beyond simple medicinal herbs and minerals; even insectoids can be used, not to mention the many interstellar beasts and rare pharmaceutical ingredients available.\nHowever, the higher the grade of medicinal ingredients, the more impurities they contain that are difficult to remove. Thus, potion-makers must use psychic power to cleanse the impurities before they can be used.\nAdditionally, the process of crafting Star-Class potions is more complex, and even a small mistake can ruin the entire batch.\nThis time, they were crafting a Star-Class healing potion, which could rapidly heal non-fatal wounds.\nHigher-grade healing potions, such as Subgiant-Class, could mend life-threatening injuries.\nAs for the legendary Supergiant healing potions, they could completely restore anyone who still had a breath of life.\nOf course, such legendary potions were far beyond Arix’s reach. She hadn’t even crafted anything above Star Class yet.",

      "content": "Chapter 51: Star-Class Potion\nArix watched Sims carefully, observing the steps and techniques he used in potion crafting.\nSims gathered the required ingredients, and Arix was surprised to see an Insectoid Core among them.\nNoticing Arix’s gaze, Sims smiled and asked, \"You’re wondering why an Insectoid Core can be used for medicine, aren’t you?\"\n\"Yeah, I thought Insectoid Cores were only used to make Psychic Ware,\" Arix replied.\n\"Insectoid Cores are valuable. They can replace energy stones and are crucial in the production of weapons, Psychic Ware, potions, and mechas. I won’t elaborate too much—your school will teach you more later. For now, let me show you how to remove the impurities from an Insectoid Core. Here, take one.\"\nSims handed a purple core to Arix and signaled for her to follow along.\nArix marveled at the core in her hand. She hadn’t expected such an ugly insectoid to have such a beautiful and mysterious core that looked like an amethyst.\nSims explained, \"This is a Star-Class Insectoid Core, but it still contains residual, unruly psychic power from the insectoid. Only when these traces are completely removed can it be used as medicine. Now, channel your psychic power into it and eliminate the impurities bit by bit.\"\n\"Alright.\" Arix fixed her gaze on the core and began channeling her psychic power into it. In less than a second, the core suddenly split into two pieces.\nArix didn’t even have time to react before the core was gone, leaving her holding the broken pieces, looking helpless and worried at Sims.\nSims’ lips twitched. He looked at the shattered Insectoid Core in Arix’s hands with dismay.\nThis was a Star-Class core, yet it couldn’t withstand even a second of her psychic power. He could only imagine how overwhelming her psychic power must be.\nWith a strained smile, Sims reassured her, \"It’s not your fault; I forgot that your psychic power is Supergiant+. The usual method won’t work.\"\nArix breathed a sigh of relief and asked, \"So what should I do?\"\nSims initially considered suggesting she use half of her psychic power, but he changed his mind and said, \"Try using the smallest, faintest amount of psychic power.\"\n\"Got it,\" Arix said. She took a new Insectoid Core, closed her eyes, and carefully drew a thin thread of psychic power from her psychic world. She then slowly guided it into the core.\nArix’s psychic power entered the Insectoid Core. This core was formed from the concentrated psychic energy of all insectoids. Inside, besides the purple psychic mist, there was also a crimson mist filled with a violent aura.\nOutside, Sims was watching Arix intently. When he saw her finally enter the Insectoid Core, he breathed a sigh of relief and cautioned, \"Remember, once your psychic power is contaminated by insectoid impurities, cut off the affected area immediately. Otherwise, if these impurities make it back to your psychic world, at best they will cause chaos, and at worst, they could be fatal with no cure.\"\n\"Got it,\" Arix replied solemnly.\nArix used her psychic power to first observe the crimson mist. Curiosity got the better of her, and she extended her mental tendrils, cautiously touching the red mist.\nThe crimson mist rippled with agitation.\nArix expected an immediate attack, but after a moment, the red mist didn’t assault her psychic power. Instead, it recoiled quickly, like it had encountered a natural enemy.\nIf Arix’s psychic power had eyes, it would certainly have blinked in bewilderment. This wasn’t quite like what Sims had said.\nArix found the crimson mist oddly appetizing. It wasn’t a physical craving but a longing that emanated from her psychic power.\nShe muttered to herself that it was an impurity and shouldn’t be eaten, but by the time she realized it, her mental tendrils had transformed into a mouth and taken a small bite of the crimson mist.\nShe hadn’t managed to stop it in time and could only watch helplessly as her psychic power ingested a piece of the Insectoid Core’s impurities.\nIt felt a bit like watching your dog eat a bone out of a garbage can while on a walk.\nArix was stunned. But in the next moment, a feeling of immense satisfaction came from her psychic power, like tasting a hot, spicy soup on a winter day.\nHer mouth fell open in surprise as she looked at the crimson mist. Not only did her psychic power crave more, but she herself was also starting to feel tempted.\nSwallowing her saliva, Arix didn’t stop her psychic power this time. In a matter of moments, her psychic power had devoured all the \"impurities\" in the Insectoid Core.\nArix raised her eyebrows. Once her psychic power had its fill, she drew it back into her psychic world. She then used her awareness to observe her inner world.\nShe had expected her psychic power to still be lying dormant like before, but in her psychic world, her power had taken the form of three Psychic Incarnations. They circled her conscious form as if they were alive.\nArix inspected the strange Psychic Incarnations closely, and finally confirmed that she wasn’t mistaken.\nThe first Psychic Incarnation radiated a sense of vitality and looked at Arix with a gentle kindness, like a caring elder.\nThe second carried an air of aloofness, gazing at Arix as if she were a silly little sister.\nThe third had a cute, almost silly demeanor, rubbing up against Arix’s consciousness in an affectionate, playful way.\n\"You’re sentient, aren’t you?\" Arix asked gently, looking at the three small Psychic Incarnations.\nThe three nodded in unison.\n\"Then why haven’t I seen you before?\" she asked curiously. She had been to her psychic world several times but had never encountered them.\nThe three exchanged glances before the cute one finally spoke first. \"Arix, we are your Souls of Anima, Wisdom, and Desire. Before, your physical power was too weak. If we had awakened, your body wouldn’t have been able to handle our power and would have collapsed.\"\nA soft and adorable voice echoed in Arix’s consciousness.\nArix felt a bit disoriented, her mind reeling at the realization that her soul had developed its own form and was now speaking to her.\nHowever, in the age of interstellar travel, psychic power was already considered akin to soul energy.\nSince Arix hadn’t fully explored this field, she decided there wasn’t anything too shocking about the possibility of her souls talking back.\nWith this thought, Arix regained her composure. She asked curiously, \"Can everyone’s psychic power become conscious?\"\nAll three Psychic Incarnations shook their heads. Given the complexity of the question, it was the Soul of Wisdom who answered, \"No, currently, you’re the only one.\" Her voice was cool and calm.\n\"Why is that?\" Arix inquired.\n\"Unknown!\" The Soul of Wisdom’s voice betrayed a hint of rare frustration. As the one responsible for intelligence, not knowing something stung her pride.\nArix remained silent and then changed the topic. \"You don’t have names yet, do you? Let me give you some, okay?\"\nThe three Psychic Incarnations froze for a moment. Desire nodded enthusiastically, Wisdom gave a reserved nod, and Anima not only nodded but patted Arix on the head like a gentle elder.\n\"Soul of Anima... let’s give you a simple name: Vita.\"\n\"Wisdom oversees knowledge, so you’ll be called Sophia.\"\n\"Desire governs passion, so you’ll be Cupid.\"\nCupid seemed delighted with the name, brushing against Arix’s hand with excitement.\nArix happily patted Cupid and then suddenly remembered something. \"Cupid, why did you eat the insectoid impurities just now? The red psychic power.\"\n\"Tasty, it’s good to eat,\" Cupid said, tilting his head in confusion as if wondering why Arix even asked.\nArix couldn’t resist Cupid’s adorable charm. However, the chubby little one couldn’t provide her with a clear answer.\nTurning her gaze to Sophia, Arix hoped the Soul of Wisdom could shed some light on the situation.\nSophia lifted her head gracefully before speaking in a calm tone, \"That insectoid was likely in a mating state before. Its psychic power was associated with desire, so it served as a kind of tonic for Cupid.\"\n\"Oh, that makes sense,\" Arix said, finally understanding. She noticed the time was getting late and said her goodbyes to the trio. \"I need to go now. Thank you all. I’ll come back to visit when I can.\"\nShe took one last look at the three adorable little beings and then smiled before leaving her consciousness and awakening fully.",

Let’s continue,\" Arix replied with a smile, shaking her head.\nShe had no intention of revealing anything about the trio and what had happened.\nHer psychic power manifesting itself was so absurd that even she found it hard to believe.\nAlso, her psychic abilities were already on a Supergiant+ level, which was extraordinary in itself.\nIf others knew her psychic power had its own consciousness, it wouldn’t bring her applause and joy but rather suspicion and fear—and ultimately greed.\n\"Why does she have it and I don’t?\"\n\"What makes her luckier than me?\"\n\"If I kill her, will I get it too?\"\nArix had seen many people before who became victims because they were envied and betrayed. Such individuals often trusted others too easily, revealing everything without any caution.\nIn short, human nature is complicated. If you can’t find balance, you’ll inevitably fall into the abyss and be shattered to pieces.\nArix sighed in her heart. Refocusing, she carefully followed Sims’ method of removing impurities from the medical ingredients in front of her.\nShe used her psychic power to cleanse impurities from each necessary mineral. But unlike making the Planet-Class potion, she couldn’t simply wait to mix everything after brewing the solution.\nInstead, Arix needed to add the medical herbs at different stages of the brewing process based on time and heat.\nInterrupting the process or getting the timing wrong would mean the entire potion was ruined.\nArix crushed the medical herbs needed and put them into a test tube.\nWhile brewing, she used her psychic power to separate the impurities from the medicinal juice and then wrapped them in her psychic energy before removing them.\nShe repeated the process with the next medical ingredient, crushing and adding it to remove any impurities.\nFinally, Arix placed the last piece of medical mineral on the table into the mixture, cleaning its impurities as well.\nOnly then did she exhale deeply.\nShe poured the solution into a potion vial and sealed it. This marked her first-ever Star-Class healing potion.\nSims had been watching Arix the whole time. Initially surprised, he eventually became numb to his Moon Pie’s talents.\nTo make a Star-Class potion on her first try—if word got out, it would shake not just the Alliance but the Empire too.\nAnd Arix was still so young, just a first-year student. Making a Star-Class potion at such a young age... Sims was at a loss for words, unsure whether she was a genius or a monster.\nArix had no idea what Sims was thinking. She beamed brightly and handed him the potion she had made.\n\"Check it out. Does this potion look like a success?\" she asked.\nSeeing the adorable and well-behaved Arix, Sims’s heart almost melted. He stopped worrying—no matter how brilliant she was, she was always his apprentice and his granddaughter. He was confident Arix would always show him respect.\nWith that in mind, Sims smiled affectionately at Arix and said, \"Alright, let me take a look.\"\nSims took the potion and placed it on the analyzer, pressing the activation button.\nAs the analyzer’s startup light turned on, \"Analyzing in progress\" appeared on the screen.\nAfter ten seconds, there was a ding as the analyzer stopped. Line by line, the screen displayed the results:\nPotion Name: Star-Class Healer\nPurity: 95%\nEfficacy Utilization: 96%\nImpurity Retention: 5%\nQuality Rating: 80/100\nLooking at the unsurprising results, Sims was both thrilled and overwhelmed by Arix’s excellence—sweet torture, indeed.\nTurning to Arix with a serious expression, Sims said, \"I have something important to tell you, and you must remember it.\"\n\"Alright, I’m all ears,\" Arix nodded solemnly.\nThough Sims trusted her, he reiterated, \"In the future, don’t make potions in front of anyone. Also, until you can fully protect yourself, say that any potion you’ve made was actually made by me. Got it?\"\nArix understood the concern behind Sims’s words, and her face showed deep gratitude and respect. \"Yes, I understand. Thank you.\"\n\"That’s my Moon Pie,\" Sims said, ruffling her hair with a bit of reluctance. \"I’ve taught you everything. This afternoon, head back to the training base. When classes start at the academy, make sure you study the videos I sent you. Now, go back and rest.\"\n\"Okay, see you later, Grandpa Sims.\" Arix hugged Sims with a bit of reluctance before heading toward the Chemistry Department exit.\nSims silently watched her departing figure. Maybe it was just his aging eyes, but he felt like he’d witnessed the birth of a Chemistry Star.\nShaking his head with a laugh, Sims went back to brewing another healing potion.\nOutside the Chemistry Department, Arix felt a pang of longing for her roommates and decided she might as well head back to the training base now.\nFirst, she said goodbye to Kellan. Then she returned to the corps hospital and packed her things.\nAfter changing into her training uniform, she bid farewell to the nurses and doctors there.\n\"Make sure to take care of that arm! If anything goes wrong, come find me.\"\n\"I’m not going to say you’re welcome back!\"\n\"See you—no, I mean bye-bye!\"\nArix smiled at the playful nurses and doctors. She gave them one final wave and left the corps hospital with a grin on her face.\nBack at the training base, Arix passed the checkpoint at the entrance with her digital bracelet. While heading to her dormitory, she noticed the students and instructors of the Hecaris Military Academy training on the field.\n\"Look, Arix is back!\"\n\"I heard she got injured fighting insectoids, so she was sent to the hospital.\"\n\"She’s amazing! If we faced an insectoid, we’d probably just run for our lives.\"\nNoticing their students’ distraction, the instructors frowned. Just as they were about to shout at the trainees, they spotted Arix returning.\n\"Arix, come here!\" Ortiz called out.\nArix stiffened and immediately replied, \"Yes, sir!\"\nShe quickly ran up to the instructor, saluted, and asked a bit nervously, \"Sir?\"\nOrtiz glared at her with a stern expression, looking every bit like a grim reaper.\nArix was anxious under his gaze. She stole a few glances at Ortiz but quickly looked away when she saw his expression.\n\"Arix,\" Ortiz said seriously, reaching out to grip her shoulder.\nEven though his hand wasn’t heavy, Arix felt an almost unbearable weight.\n\"Welcome back,\" he said in his deep, booming voice.\nArix was stunned for a moment, then looked up quickly to see the instructor smiling back at her.\nHer eyes crinkled into crescent moons, and she couldn’t help but smile. \"Thank you, sir.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 53: Daydream Coming True\n\"Great, you look energetic. Come join the training,\" Ortiz said with a smile, appearing to be in a good mood.\nBut Arix couldn’t muster a smile, a bit timid as she tentatively asked, \"Sir, shouldn’t you just tell me to go back and rest properly?\"\nOrtiz gave her a stern look and asked, \"Do you think you need that?\"\n\"I...\" Arix tried to resist.\nOrtiz quickly lost his patience. He turned her around and shouted, \"Stop your babbling, or I’ll have you make up the five days of training you owe.\"\nHearing this, Arix almost stumbled from fright. She felt as if all her tiredness and pain had been scared away. She immediately ran over to join her classmates in the obstacle run.\n\"Wow!\" the students of Hecaris Military Academy initially thought Arix would go back to rest. They didn’t expect such a turnaround, so most of them started to cheer along.\n\"What are you yelling for, you think you’re gorillas? Do you still want to score or not?\" Ortiz barked.\nThe students instantly quieted down. One by one, they lined up at the starting point of the obstacle course, waiting for Instructor Bauer’s whistle to blow.\n\"Arix, come over and put on the weight ring,\" Virtanen said gently.\n\"Alright,\" Arix replied, then she walked toward Virtanen. But when she received the weight ring, she noticed it was still of Planet-Class weight.\n\"Any problems, Arix? Is it too heavy?\" Virtanen asked. He saw that Arix hadn’t put it on yet and showed some concern.\nIn his eyes, Arix was still the fragile freshman who often ended up in the hospital. He hadn’t considered that Arix’s physical power had grown stronger, almost reaching Subgiant Class.\n\"Sir, I don’t think this weight ring is right for me. I need one that’s 500 kilograms,\" Arix said earnestly.\nSince she was training, Arix wanted to do her best. A Planet-Class weight ring now felt no different to her than wearing nothing at all.\nShe thought so, but Virtanen still thought he had heard wrong. He asked incredulously, \"Are you asking for a Subgiant-Class weight ring? Do you realize what you’re saying?\"\n\"Yes, Subgiant-Class,\" Arix nodded firmly.\n\"Let’s stick with the Planet Class for now, we’ll take it slowly,\" Virtanen suggested.\nOf course, Virtanen would feel pleased that his student was ambitious, but not when that student was Arix.\n\"No, the Planet-Class one isn’t much use to me,\" Arix flatly refused. She even thought that Virtanen was indeed too gentle. If it had been Ortiz, he would definitely have given her something heavier.\nSeeing how firmly Arix refused, Virtanen was at a loss. He quickly turned and cast a pleading look at Ortiz, shouting, \"Ortiz, come here for a moment.\"\nOrtiz heard the call, turned around, and looked at Virtanen and Arix, focusing on the weight ring. He thought Arix was complaining it was too heavy, so he quickly walked over with a frown.\n\"What’s going on?\" Ortiz asked, frowning.\n\"Arix, she...\" Virtanen started to explain but was immediately cut off by Ortiz.\nOrtiz stared intently at Arix and said, \"I’m asking her. Arix, you speak.\"\nHe had already silently sworn; if Arix dared to complain that the Planet Class weight ring was too heavy, he, Ortiz, would definitely make sure she would have a \"wonderful\" memory from today.\nArix, intimidated by Ortiz’s expression, stiffened up but firmly responded, \"Sir, the Planet-Class weight ring is too light for me. I need a Subgiant-Class one.\"\nOrtiz looked at Arix in surprise. Then he quickly composed himself and asked, \"Are you sure?\"\n\"Yes, sir! My physical power is already at the peak of Star Class. I just need a bit more pressure to upgrade smoothly,\" Arix said openly, feeling there was no need to hide her physical power.\nOrtiz and Virtanen both tensed up, their pupils shrinking. They looked at each other as if they had seen a devil, both utterly shocked.\nFinally, Ortiz recovered first. He looked at Arix with a complex expression for a long while, then said to Virtanen, \"Give her the 500 kilograms.\"\n\"Okay.\" Virtanen was still somewhat dazed. His hands automatically took back the weight ring, adjusted it to 500 kilograms, and then handed it to Arix.\nArix, with the adjusted weight ring on, smiled happily and said, \"Thank you, I’m off to train.\"\nAfter Arix left, Bauer also came over. Seeing Ortiz and Virtanen doubting themselves, he asked somewhat puzzled, \"What’s with you two? Weren’t you both feeling guilty every day when Arix wasn’t here? How come you don’t seem excited at all now that she’s back?\"\nOrtiz didn’t speak but pulled out a cigarette from his pocket. He lit it with a lighter, took a melancholic drag, and then said gloomily, \"Nothing, just suddenly felt that being Arix’s instructor is like riding a roller coaster. It’s thrilling.\"\n\"???\" Bauer was so confused. He felt that Ortiz seemed to have gone out of his mind.\nThen he turned to Virtanen and asked, \"Is Ortiz alright?\"\n\"He’s fine. I think the problem is with me. I think from now on, I’m going to believe in daydreams because sometimes they really can come true,\" Virtanen replied mysteriously.\nBauer, with a vein popping on his forehead, couldn’t stand it anymore and delivered a loving punch to the heads of both men.\n\"Ouch!! That hurts!!\"\n\"It hurts so bad, Bauer, what are you doing, are you crazy?\"\nOrtiz and Virtanen crouched down, clutching their heads and screaming in pain.\n\"I thought you guys were acting a bit off, just wanted to give you a bit of ’treatment.’ Look, you’re back to normal now,\" Bauer said with a smug grin.\n\"So violent to your own brothers, no wonder you’re still single at 30,\" Ortiz retorted through gritted teeth.\nVirtanen nodded in agreement, sharing the resentment.\nBauer chuckled coldly. His eyes sharpened as he stared down the two jesters, his tone threatening, \"Do you guys need some more ’treatment’ then?\"\nFrightened, Ortiz and Virtanen instinctively hugged each other. However, as soon as they realized what they were doing, they quickly pushed each other away in disgust.\n\"I was just about to tell you what happened, I was just setting a mysterious mood,\" Ortiz claimed, trying to turn the situation around with a haughty retort.\n\"Cut to the chase,\" Bauer said, his lips curling up in a sneer. His expression was cold, as if to say, \"Let’s see what you’ve got.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 54: Student Officer\nOrtiz still felt like he was dreaming when he thought about the news he had just heard. He replied, \"Well, this is actually good news. Arix’s physical power has reached the peak of Star-Class, so our biggest worry is now solved.\"\nHe would never have believed that someone could improve so quickly if Arix hadn’t told him herself.\n\"Are you sure you’re not joking?\" Bauer was skeptical at first. Arix had only been injured and hospitalized for a few days—how could she have improved during that time? It seemed like a fantasy.\nOrtiz calmed down a bit, then responded, \"She told me herself, how could it be false?\"\nThen, Ortiz thought for a moment and shared his guess, \"I think there’s only one possibility for Arix’s sudden upgrade: someone must have fixed her body’s foundation. Remember? Arix had been malnourished for a whole ten years. If that was fixed, it’s not impossible for her physical power to skyrocket.\"\n\"That sounds easy to say, but who could possibly do that?\" Bauer looked at his two pals, raising his doubts.\nVirtanen recalled something, then suddenly said, \"I remember there’s a Master Chemist in the Chemistry Department. Their family and the Kerings are distant relatives.\"\nWith that statement, it felt like the case was instantly solved.\nThe three instructors all felt a bit sour inside. They thought to themselves that, Arix must be the Alliance’s strongest connection. She seemed to have a link with every big shot.\nFinally, Ortiz stared blankly and said something that Virtanen and the others couldn’t understand, \"She must be the protagonist of some female-lead fantasy story, I guess.\"\nMeanwhile, Arix was crossing a log bridge. Because of the weight ring, every step she took was a bit shaky. The bridge was five meters above the ground, and she was afraid of losing balance and falling.\nThis morning’s training session was equipment training. The training area had a 3000-meter-long track. On the track were obstacles like a log bridge, cloud ladder, vaulting horse, and climbing rope, among others.\nAfter a round of obstacles, Arix was sweating profusely. She lifted her sleeve to wipe her dirty face, rested for a bit, then started running the obstacles again.\nWhen the morning’s physical power training was over, the students looked as miserable as if they were escaping a disaster. But they still lined up orderly.\nThe instructors used an opticomputer to score each student based on their digital bracelets and announced the scores aloud.\n\"Number 12, 5 points, failed.\"\n\"Number 48, 8 points, passed.\"\n\"Number 69, 8 points, passed.\"\nArix, who was number 69, didn’t expect to just scrape a pass. Now, she was finally not at the bottom of the physical power training anymore.\nShe felt so happy, almost like crying.\nAfter the scores were announced, Ortiz made a quieting gesture. Once the students calmed down, he began to speak, \"Tomorrow is Friday, the day to show what we’ve trained for this week. I won’t spill much about the format of the competition. Just don’t let me down tomorrow, or you’ll have me to answer to. Do you understand?\"\n\"Yes, sir!\" the students responded loudly and clearly.\nOrtiz nodded in satisfaction. Then, glancing around at the students, he smiled and said, \"This afternoon’s psychic power training is canceled. At 2 PM, everyone should be in the auditorium for the military rank ceremony of our fellow student, Arix Kering. Let’s give Student Officer Arix Kering a round of applause in advance!\" Ortiz led the applause.\nClap! Clap!\nHearing the thunderous applause around her, Arix felt a rare bashfulness and covered her face.\nThe other students were cheering and shouting around her. They looked at Arix with undisguised admiration and envy in their eyes.\nStanding in the front row, Rei clapped and shouted, \"Arix, you are amazing!\"\nAn unnamed student also shouted, \"You got a military rank before even joining the army? Arix, your career is taking off. Don’t forget me when you reach the top!\"\n\"Arix, you are the pride of the Hecaris! Anyone who slanders you or speaks ill of you behind your back is an idiot!\"\nArix, moved by her laughing and playful roommates and classmates, bowed slightly and shouted gratefully, \"Thank you, everyone!!\"\nA whistle sounded, and Ortiz said with a smile, \"Alright, you’re all dismissed now. Also, Arix, I need to speak with you for a moment.\"\nArix had planned to go to the cafeteria with her roommates, but when she heard the instructor calling her, she had to cancel.\nAfter saying goodbye to her roommates, Arix approached the instructors and asked curiously, \"Sir, is there something you need?\"\n\"Have you prepared your speech for this afternoon?\" Ortiz asked, a bit worried.\nA hint of difficulty flashed across Arix’s face, but it was quickly replaced by a sweet smile. She flashed a smile and said, \"Sir, don’t worry, I’ve been preparing for this for a while.\"\nOrtiz felt something was off about Arix’s reaction, but he didn’t dwell on it. He pulled out a set of Alliance military uniforms from a container and handed it over, advising, \"This afternoon, you’re the star. Come to the backstage half an hour early, and remember to wear this uniform.\"\nArix looked at the uniform in Ortiz’s hand; it was a deep blue military one trimmed with gold thread. She then solemnly took it and said, \"Thank you, sir, I understand.\"\nOrtiz ruffled Arix’s hair with a smile and said, \"Alright, you’re dismissed now.\"\n\"Okay, goodbye, sir,\" Arix replied, while putting the Alliance uniform into her Space Button. After saying goodbye to Ortiz, she headed back to her dormitory.\nAfter finishing their physical training, students from all five military academies received notices from their instructors.\nInstead of their usual afternoon psychic power training, they were all to attend the military rank awarding ceremony for Arix.\nThis change caused different reactions from the academies.\nThe students from the Koros, known for their dedication to training, frowned in displeasure. They felt attending such a dull ceremony was just a waste of their training time.\nThe rich kids from the Snorri, on the other hand, made snide remarks. They believed they deserved the spotlight at such opportunities.\nStudents from the Ceres were indifferent. Apart from their interest in chemistry, they hardly cared about anything else.\nThe students from the Mulado considered themselves a cut above the rest. Though they didn’t say much outwardly, internally, many were quite jealous.\nIn contrast, the students from Hecaris Military Academy were as excited as if it were a holiday. To prepare for the ceremony, they got up early from their afternoon rest to get ready. Some styled their hair, others admired themselves in the mirror. They were determined to be the best-dressed of the five academies that afternoon.\nBy 1:30 PM, the auditorium’s five sections of seats, arranged from top to bottom, were filled with students from all five academies.\nSince the ceremony hadn’t started yet, the students were idly chatting. They occasionally glanced curiously at the instructors sitting in the front row of the stage.\nAdrian and Cirilla from Mulado Military Academy sat near the stage. Feeling bored, Adrian nudged his sister and asked, \"Who do you think will award the military rank to Arix today?\"\nCirilla casually replied, \"I don’t know, probably one of the instructors.\" Normally, it would be an elder or a superior officer, and if no elder was present, an instructor would step in.\n\"I think there might be a surprise,\" Adrian said expectantly.\nCirilla was indifferent, as she found this discussion uninteresting. She had seen such ceremonies many times. If it weren’t for Arix being the focus this time, she might have fallen asleep already.\nHowever, Cirilla soon became restless. She was annoyed because around her, there was constant slander about Arix.\n\"Do you think Arix got this rank by cozying up to Drexel?\" someone speculated nearby.\n\"It’s hard to say, but it’s possible. After all, no matter the merits, it’s unusual to be awarded a military rank before joining the forces. I heard that the title of Student Officer has rarely been given out before.\"\n\"Definitely. I hate people like Arix who just suck up to those in power. It’s ruining the reputation of military students.\"\nFinally unable to tolerate it anymore, Cirilla and Adrian both stood up and sharply turned to face the three gossiping students behind them.\n\"What are you looking at, Cirilla?\" Netta asked with a harsh tone. Obviously, she already had a contentious relationship with Cirilla before.\nCirilla scoffed as if she had just seen something amusing. \"What am I looking at? I’m obviously looking at a joke.\"\nNetta stood up abruptly, furious, \"What do you mean, Cirilla? Are you calling us a joke?\"\nIgnoring Netta’s brewing anger, Cirilla shifted the topic. \"I heard you like Drexel?\"\n\"So what if I do? Are you taking Arix’s side? Why are you so nosy? Don’t you think you’re overstepping?\" Netta challenged aggressively.\nCirilla laughed genuinely, pitying Netta. From the moment Netta slandered Arix, she had doomed herself never to get close to Drexel. Such a pity indeed.\nCirilla was no longer angry. She believed that mean people would get their karma from fate, especially those who are foolish and unaware, doomed to tragedy. She coldly chuckled and advised, \"Netta, as your classmate, let me give you a piece of advice: Don’t fall for Drexel, because you two will never happen.\"\nWith that, Cirilla no longer paid any attention to the foolish girl behind her and sat down with her brother.\n\"What does Cirilla mean by that?\" Netta fumed, ready to cause a scene, but was held back by her companions.\n\"Netta, let it go. We can’t afford to offend Cirilla,\" one of her friends advised.\nAnother added, \"Yeah, and after the term starts, she’ll be the Prima of the Psychic Ware Department. If she holds a grudge and docks our credits, we might have to repeat the year.\"\nNetta understood this too—this was why her friends were able to hold her back successfully.\nFortunately, the military rank awarding ceremony began at that moment. Netta breathed a sigh of relief and sat back down.",

      "content": "Chapter 55: Becoming A Real Soldier\n\"Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we are honored to host a grand military rank awarding ceremony for our student, Arix,\" announced the instructor hosting the ceremony. He began clapping, and soon a thunderous applause filled the auditorium.\nAmidst the applause, today’s guest of honor, Arix Kering, walked out from backstage. She ascended the steps to the stage, arriving beside the hosting instructor.\nDressed in a deep blue uniform of the Alliance with golden embroidery, Arix looked strikingly gallant.\nHer black hair, tied back, revealed a delicate oval face.\nHer eyes, deep and calm like sapphires, complemented her noble brows that hinted at her spirited nature.\nEven her cute face carried an air of uncompromising resolve.\n\"Wow, so sassy.\"\n\"Go Arix! You’re the sassiest!\"\n\"She’s so beautiful, how did we not notice this before?\"\n\"Wait, did the instructor get the name wrong? Isn’t her last name Thalis?\"\nThe crowd in the auditorium erupted into cheers at the sight of Arix’s dazzling and sassy appearance, as if their favorite idol had just appeared on stage.\nSome even thought the instructor had mispronounced her name, but their voices were quickly drowned out by the roar of the crowd.\n\"Alright, quiet down now. Next, we’re going to welcome a very special guest to award the military rank to Arix. Please welcome Admiral Thaddeus Kering! Let’s give him a round of applause,\" the instructor announced, his voice cracking slightly with excitement.\nThe students thought they had misheard.\nSeconds later, a man in an Alliance uniform, adorned with numerous medals of honor, walked onto the stage. As soon as he appeared, a gasp went through the hall, nearly lifting the roof off with excitement.\nAs soon as Thaddeus showed up, all the students in the reception hall went wild, jumping to their feet and screaming like crazy.\n\"Oh my gosh, it’s Admiral Thaddeus Kering, in the flesh!\"\n\"Admiral Thaddeus, the eternal legend!\"\n\"Admiral Thaddeus, look this way! I love you!\"\n...\nSome students, overwhelmed by a social mania, ran from their seats to the stage, waving and shouting in an attempt to catch their idol’s attention.\nIn less than a minute, the whole hall was in chaos, and even the host officer couldn’t keep control.\nArix was still in shock from seeing her dad, but she was even more stunned by the crazed behavior of her fellow students.\nIt was scarier than any celebrity-chasing scene—especially that guy who, while screaming \"I love you,\" blew kisses to his father.\nAs the situation got more chaotic, Thaddeus took the microphone from the officer. He cleared his throat and said, \"Everyone, let’s calm down for a moment.\"\nThaddeus didn’t shout. He spoke in a normal tone, but the hall instantly quieted down.\nThe students gazed at Thaddeus with sparkling eyes, filled with fervor, admiration, and aspiration.\n\"Thank you all for your support, I’ve seen your enthusiasm. I’m honored to be here today to present my daughter, Arix, with her first military rank. She’s the star today, so I can’t steal her thunder. Otherwise, she might complain to her mom about me,\" Thaddeus said.\nHis mature and humorous words made the students below chuckle.\nIt was only then that some students fully realized what was happening. They finally understood that Arix really was a Kering and that Thaddeus was family.\nThis revelation caused quite a stir. Many students who had been following the gossip about Arix and Drexel were stunned.\nThose who had been rooting for or against the pair were silenced at the same moment.\n\"Who started that rumor? They’re siblings, not a couple, isn’t that going too far?\"\n\"Although I’m a bit disappointed, I’m here for this brother-sister vibe.\"\n\"That’s good too, Arix is still single. So we still have a chance.\"\n\"Hey! Keep it down. Admiral Thaddeus is still here.\"\n...\nListening to the students’ discussions, Thaddeus’s expression remained unchanged, still showing his usual mild and gentle demeanor.\nHowever, when he noticed a few guilty-looking students in the crowd, his eyes narrowed slightly.\nA small smile played at the corners of his mouth as he said with a hint of amusement, \"I’ve also heard some rumors about Arix and Drexel; I know they are mostly baseless and fabricated. I am very disappointed in the students who spread these rumors.\"\nThe room fell silent with his words. Most students had not participated in the bizarre rumors, but a few felt guilty and frightened by Admiral Thaddeus’s remarks.\nThaddeus’s tone grew more severe as he continued, his voice carrying an edge of sharpness and authority. \"I hope you all remember this: by attending a military academy, you are already half a soldier. Your actions no longer represent just yourselves, but the entire Alliance military. Have you all got that?\"\n\"Yes, sir!\" All the students responded loudly, their voices echoing powerfully.\nThaddeus scanned all the students. Those who had looked evasive now showed expressions of remorse. Finally, he showed a genuine smile and said, \"Alright, enough from me. Let’s give the floor to Arix. Please, a round of applause.\"\nClap, clap, clap, clap, clap!\nThis time, the applause was strong and unanimous.\nArix took the microphone her father handed her and cleared her throat with a smile. \"Actually, Admiral Kering has already said most of what I wanted to say. But regarding the rumors, I must make a serious rebuttal. Someone said I’m not worthy of Drexel? I advise you to visit an eye doctor, and I’ll cover the medical bill.\"\nThe students burst into laughter; the previously suffocative air had been lightened by Arix’s humor.\n\"Arix, we support you!!\"\n\"Yeah, Arix, you’re the best!\"\n\"Exactly, and remember, Drexel doesn’t even have a rank yet!\"\n...\nArix looked at these lovely students, her smile widening.\nShe continued, \"Thank you, everyone. What I want to say is, in this world, everyone deserves the best for themselves. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Don’t compare your weaknesses with someone else’s strengths; that’s only going to hurt yourself. If someone ever tells you you’re less than someone else, just tell them to MIND THEIR OWN FREAKING BUSINESS!\"\nThe hall erupted in laughter again.\n\"I can just imagine the gossips choking on that!\"\n\"Why didn’t I think of that before? Next time some busybody snoops into my private life, I’ll just throw that back at them! Haha!\"\n\"Haha, way to go, dude.\"\n...\nThe students in the reception hall erupted into laughter at Arix’s words. Amid the laughter, Arix handed the microphone back to the host officer.\n\"Alright, our opening remarks are over, now let’s officially begin the military rank awarding ceremony.\"\nAs the officer’s voice faded, the anthem of the Alliance played, and the students returned to their seats, settling down quietly and respectfully facing the stage.\nDuring the anthem, a master of ceremonies emerged from backstage, holding a long tray covered with velvet. On the tray lay a military cap and a medal.\nWhen the master of ceremonies reached Thaddeus’s side, Arix stepped forward to face Thaddeus and gave a military salute, her hand crisp and fingers together.\nThaddeus, with a proud look in his eyes, smiled and returned the salute. Then he carefully picked up the cap from the tray and placed it on Arix’s head, making sure it was straight.\nNext, he picked up the medal and pinned it onto Arix’s uniform. His expression was stern and solemn as he said, \"A military cap signifies duty; a uniform represents dignity; military boots carry sanctity; a soldier bears a mission. From today, you, Arix, are a Student Officer. With that rank comes responsibility. Arix Kering, on behalf of the Alliance, I ask you one final question: Are you willing to become a soldier of the Alliance?\"\n\"Yes, sir!\" Arix saluted sharply, her response unwavering.\n\"Good, everyone, salute to Arix!\" Thaddeus’s eyes were slightly red. As a soldier, he felt immense pride for his daughter; as a father, he also harbored concerns about whether this young woman could safely navigate the harsh life of military service.\nEveryone in the reception hall stood up and saluted Arix. Each person’s eyes carried blessings and admiration.\nOnce a soldier of the Alliance, Arix no longer belonged just to her own small world, but to the nation known as the Alliance.",

      "content": "Chapter 56: Exchanging Gifts\nAfter the ceremony, the students left the hall one by one. Some students took advantage of the early evening to continue training at their favorite training grounds, while others returned to their dormitories. They needed to prepare for tomorrow’s competition.\nAfter saying goodbye to her dad in the hall, Arix went backstage. She quickly changed back into her training clothes. After carefully folding her military uniform, she stored it in her Space Button like treating the most precious treasures.\nAfter making sure everything was done, she walked out of the hall alone.\nAs soon as she stepped outside, Arix saw her dear brother Drexel. The guy was standing not far away by a small grove, waving at her energetically.\n\"Arix, come here.\" Drexel called out with a bright, mischievous smile, as if he had something exciting to share.\nArix raised an eyebrow, curious. Although she didn’t know what her Drexel was up to, she decided to go over and see.\nAs soon as Arix approached, she discovered that it wasn’t just Drexel; there were five familiar faces in the grove.\n\"Why are you all here?\" asked Arix.\n\"Arix, aren’t you happy to see us?\" Adrian bounded over to Arix like a big golden retriever, playfully asking with a mock sad look.\nArix’s eyes softened, and she smiled as she ruffled Adrian’s hair, \"I’m very happy, just a bit surprised.\"\n\"Great, here, Arix, this is a gift I got for you, congratulations on your military rank.\" Adrian pulled out a mecha figurine from his Space Button and handed it to Arix.\n\"Thank you, I really like it.\" Arix accepted the mecha figurine, examining it with curiosity and a smile.\n\"Arix, here’s my gift. Knowing you like mecha, I prepared this Star-Class energy stone for you. I hope you become a mecha master soon!\" Cirilla took out a small box, opened it herself, and displayed the Star-Class energy stone inside.\nThe energy stone, which is placed at the chest of a mecha, not only powers the mecha but also enhances its weaponry.\nThis simple black stone might look ordinary, but a Star-Class energy stone starts at a million dollars. Moreover, it’s usually not available for purchase as such resources are generally monopolized by officials.\nThus, this gift was truly a heartwarming surprise for Arix.\n\"Thank you, Cirilla.\" Arix joyfully accepted the energy stone.\nNearby, Varden took out a slightly larger box from his Space Button and handed it to Arix, saying, \"This is my gift for you. Open it and see, I hope you like it.\"\nCurious, Arix opened the box and was surprised to find a mini Space Button inside, along with a set of exquisite alchemy equipment.\n\"Thank you. I was just wanting a set of alchemy equipment, and now I don’t need to buy one.\" Arix laughed happily.\n\"Glad you like it.\" Varden looked at Arix affectionately.\n\"Arix, congratulations on being the first to receive a military rank. This is my gift for you, a platinum card for. That gives you a membership of all my family’s business. From now on, anything you buy from my family’s store comes with a 40% discount,\" Elio said as he handed Arix a black card with a golden Damsey logo on it.\n\"Wow, Elio, you got any more? Give me one too.\" Drexel knew that the Lasairs had stores throughout the Alliance and even in the Empire. From everyday needs to mecha battleships, there was nothing the Lasairs didn’t sell. So, even though it was just a card, its value was incredibly high.\nElio rolled his eyes at Drexel and said, \"No more. I can only give out one card a year. If you want one, wait until next year.\"\n\"Alright, it’s a deal then!\" Drexel immediately responded with a happy smile.\nArix blinked, surprised by how important this discount card was, and accepted the black gold card with a sense of gravity, politely saying, \"Thank you, Elio.\"\n\"Hey, Elio, don’t forget about us. Remember to get us one too,\" Cirilla chimed in, clearly envious.\n\"What? You think these cards are wholesale? That everyone gets one?\" said Elio as he looked at his eagerly anticipating friends in disbelief.\n\"You’re the heir to the Lasair family; if you can’t do it, no one can. Be generous... OK, forget about Adrian, he doesn’t need one, but the four of us are counting on you,\" Cirilla teased, raising an eyebrow and blinking with a smile.\nElio looked at his four companions and finally sighed, \"I’ll ask my old man when I get back. If he agrees, I’ll do it. As for Shuai Shuai, I can at least give him a golden card with a 20% discount.\"\nElio then took out a gold card from his Space Button and handed it over.\n\"Thank you,\" Adrian said, delightedly accepting the golden card.\nHis big sister, Cirilla, is the family heir, and she would eventually receive a platinum card from Lasairfamily. As for Adrian, getting a gold card now was lucky enough, and he was happy to show off to his elders at home.\n\"Wow, Elio, always so generous,\" Drexel and the others gave him thumbs up, even Zephyr, usually as cold as ice, followed suit with a thumbs up.\n\"Alright, alright, let’s see what Zephyr has prepared for a gift,\" Elio, slightly shy, changed the subject.\nZephyr, his face as expressionless as ever, silently took out a delicate, small energy pistol for ladies from his space.\n\"Ah, knew it would be a gun,\" Elio said with a knowing look.\n\"Yep, Zephyr always likes giving guns. He gave me one for my birthday last time too,\" Drexel suddenly laughed, remembering something.\n\"My great-grandfather too! At his age, nearly toothless, he received a gun. You should have seen his face; I almost died laughing,\" Elio laughed heartily.\n\"And there’s my little cousin who was just born. Thankfully, it was a model gun. Otherwise, my aunt and uncle would have flipped out right there, haha,\" Cirilla also recalled, laughing so hard she was shaking like a leaf.",

      "content": "Chapter 57: The Heir’s Past\n\"That’s all?\" Zephyr’s eyes narrowed slightly. Even though his voice was steady, it sent a chill down the spines of Drexel and the others.\nSuddenly, they realized that Zephyr’s weapon, which was originally a lady’s energy pistol, had be swapped by his own high-end energy gun. The gun’s muzzle casually pointed at them, as if it might accidentally fire at any moment.\nThe smiles on Drexel and the others froze, and a strong sense of danger made them instinctively shut off their mouths. Elio, who was the most afraid, made a zipping motion over his mouth and timidly gave a thumbs up, as if asking, \"Is that enough, sir?\"\nZephyr didn’t say a word but put the energy gun back into his Space Button. Then he turned to Arix with a stern face and said, \"If it breaks, you can come to me to fix it. If you ever don’t want it anymore, you can give it back to me.\"\n\"Okay, thank you. I will cherish it,\" Arix promised solemnly.\n\"Um,\" Zephyr replied, his voice still emotionless.\nFor some reason, Arix felt that Zephyr was unusually gentle at that moment, but she quickly thought it might just be her imagination. Maybe it was just the joy of the day making everyone seem softer. Or perhaps his gentleness was only meant for the gun.\nLaughing at her own thoughts, Arix shook her head and put everyone’s gifts into her Space Button. Then she pulled out a large bunch of various potions.\n\"Thank you for the gifts. These are the Planet-Class potions I made. I hope you don’t mind,\" she said as she handed out a bunch to everyone.\n\"Wow, Arix, you can make Planet-Class potions now? That’s amazing! Can I count on you for that from now on?\" Adrian admired her with sparkling eyes, excitedly trying to hug Arix’s arm.\nBut Drexel noticed immediately. He blocked Adrian with his chest and bared his small fangs in a threatening way, his expression saying, \"Stay away from my sister.\"\nAdrian huffed and rolled his eyes at Drexel. Then he looked at Arix again, his eyes bright and shining, and asked with a sunny smile, \"Arix, do you need an assistant of something? ’cause I can definitely do that.\"\nBefore Arix could answer, Drexel interrupted harshly, \"No need! My sister has a brother, and that’s enough.\"\nAdrian’s eyes widened in anger, ready to argue back, but then Cirilla grabbed him by the collar and dragged him away. \"Enough, Adrain, stop it. You know Drexel is overprotective. Be careful, or he might hit the crap out of you, and I won’t be able to stop him,\" Cirilla said, patting Adrian’s head to calm him down.\n\"Whatever,\" Adrian muttered, his lips pouting, but at least he calmed down physically.\nWhen Varden received the potions, his professional habits kicked in. He started examining each potion carefully.\nThere were about twenty potions, mostly Planet-Class healing potions, but also some for hair growth, cancer prevention, and even one for breast enhancement, which made Varden’s mouth twitch as he rubbed his forehead, unable to bear looking at them any longer.\nThen he put all the potions into his Space Button.\nThe others weren’t as dramatic; their happiness stemmed more from Arix’s thoughtfulness.\nAfter the gifts were distributed, everyone said their goodbyes, leaving only Arix and Drexel walking back to their dormitory together.\n\"Arix, are you happy today?\" Drexel asked casually.\n\"Yeah, probably the happiest day since I came here,\" Arix responded, thinking of Thaddeus, Cirilla, Adrian, and a genuine smile spread across her face.\n\"By the way, you and Zephyr, being heirs of the five noble families, why aren’t you competing against each other but instead have such good relationships?\" Arix finally voiced her long-held curiosity.\nEspecially during the exams, she had thought that the noble families would be sabotaging each other, but the brotherly love shown there had stunned her.\n\"Isn’t it normal for those big families to fight each other, struggling to be first or second?\" she added.\nDrexel recalled some distant memories with a bit of emotion, \"Actually, it wasn’t this good at the beginning, especially Elio. He had all the airs of a young master. When we were kids, I’d beat him up every time I saw him.\"\nArix was speechless, now understanding why Elio targeted Drexel so much during the exams; their \"love-hate relationship\" had started from childhood.\n\"And what about Cirilla? How did you guys end up friends?\" Arix asked curiously.\n\"Cirilla, the tomboy, liked to fight with boys since she was a child. Men often bond through fighting, well, I mean brotherly love,\" Drexel quickly clarified to prevent any misunderstanding from his sister.\n\"Oh, that’s just like Cirilla. If she were in ancient Earth, she would probably be like superwoman,\" Arix said with a hint of admiration, genuinely liking the kind of girl who could hold her own against men.\n\"Arix, admiration is fine, but don’t try to be like her. What girl acts so brashly? She doesn’t act ladylike at all,\" Drexel quickly cautioned, not wanting his cute and sweet sister to turn into a tomboy like Cirilla.\nArix huffed, not quite agreeing. Then she continued, \"You haven’t told me about Zephyr yet?\"\nWhen Drexel mentioned Zephyr, he fell into a rare silence before speaking, \"Actually, Zephyr has it tough. Although he became the heir of the Calix family due to his strong talents, but the current patriarch isn’t his dad and the guy has his own sons, so Zephyr’s position in the Calix family is probably not as glamorous as it seems. I remember when we were kids, he was a bit aloof but approachable, not like now, as cold as a fish.\"\n\"Could it be that he has been through too many bad things?\" Arix asked, concerned.\nShe thought Zephyr was a good person with a cold exterior but a warm heart. Initially, she assumed he was just naturally reserved, but now it seemed there might be hidden reasons behind his demeanor.",

      "content": "Chapter 58: The Heir\n\"I don’t know much, but there was one thing that really stirred things up between the Lasair and the Calix family,\" Drexel said with a smirk, remembering the chaos.\n\"It sounds like fun, tell me more,\" Arix said, excited to hear the gossip.\nDrexel didn’t hold back, laughing as he recalled, \"It all started ten years ago when Zephyr was chosen as the heir to the Calix family. The head of the Calix family was okay with it, but his wife always saw Zephyr as a thorn in her side, thinking he stole her own son’s place.\"\n\"Poor Zephyr, he must have been targeted a lot,\" Arix sympathized with Zephyr for a moment, likening it to an interstellar family drama.\nDrexel suddenly chuckled, then ruffled his silly little sister’s hair, saying, \"You’re underestimating Zephyr. Whenever the lady dared to bother him, he would turn around and trouble her son. Even if it was an accident, Zephyr managed to pin it on her son.\"\n\"Hah, good job, Zephyr,\" Arix gave a thumbs up, applauding Zephyr. \"Keep going, Drexel, I feel like it’s going to get even more interesting.\"\n\"Later, the lady thought, why not go all out? She hired interstellar mercenaries through the black market, pretending to be space pirates to bomb the spaceship that Zephyr was on. Unfortunately, Elio was also on that ship, which really angered the Lasairs. You know, Lasair folks are not to be messed with. They immediately confronted the Calix family. If not for the leaders of the other three major families mediating on the spot, the two families might have developed a vendetta,\" Drexel explained, relieved for the Calix family.\n\"That lady must have ended up in misery,\" Arix wondered.\nDrexel scoffed mockingly, \"More than misery, I heard that overnight, her maternal family went from second-rate to bottom-tier, all because they declared they’d cut ties with her right away. And the lady herself, the main culprit, was exiled to a borderline planet. Even the pleas from the patriarch couldn’t save her.\"\nDrexel knew so much because the incident had been huge, causing even the Kering family to tighten up their household to prevent someone like her from emerging.\n\"How did Zephyr and the others get rescued then? With the explosion’s power, if they were just kids at the time, the chances of surviving wouldn’t have been high,\" Arix asked.\n\"It was lucky for Zephyr; he happened to be with Elio, the Lasairs’ only son. Elio, god bless him, had many treasures. Not just a spaceship explosion, even a mecha explosion couldn’t have killed him,\" Drexel explained.\nAnyway, those two boys were later found on a primitive planet, and after that, Elio’s haughty attitude changed a lot, probably because the week he was missing really took a toll on him,\" Drexel laughed without any sympathy.\n\"Ah, typical big families dramas. Isn’t it?\" Arix remarked after hearing the story.\nDrexel laughed at Arix’s serious demeanor and patted her head affectionately, \"Don’t forget, you’re also from a big family. Alright, we’ve reached the dormitory. Go get some rest after you get back. Try to do well in tomorrow’s competition. You know, you’re the first freshman in our class to get a military rank. It would be embarrassing if you rank poorly.\"\n\"Whatever, you’re supposed to be the heir of the Kering family. If you don’t rank higher than your little sister, I’ll see who’s embarrassed,\" Arix replied with a glare at Drexel.\n\"Hey, you little rascal, let’s make a bet. If I rank higher than you, you increase my share of the potion shop’s dividends by 5%,\" Drexel challenged with a raised eyebrow.\n\"Huh, let’s do it. If you lose, I get your opticomputer during training,\" Arix laughed coldly.\n\"Deal,\" Drexel said. His fighting spirit was rising. He looked at Arix as though a majestic tiger looked down at a naughty younger sibling.\n\"No problem,\" Arix’s competitiveness was also ignited. Vita, Sophia, and Cupid appeared behind her.\nVita still looked kind but now carried an vibe of seriousness, as if to say, ’see who dares to mess with my kids.’ Sophia remained dignified, her entire Psychic Incarnation radiating confidence. Cupid, excited, was shaking his chubby body, eager to fight.\nAn invisible cloud of tension rose between Arix and Drexel. After a standoff, they both snorted in unison and returned to their dorms.\nAfter Arix entered the building, Drexel paused, as if talking to himself, \"Sheer, those three were Arix’s Psychic Incarnations, right?\"\nThe white tiger in Drexel’s psychic world nodded its majestic head, and then a young voice rang out in Drexel’s psychic world, \"Yes, they have awakened, which means your sister’s physical power is about to break through to the Subgiant Class. Otherwise, they would still be forced to sleep in Arix’s psychic world due to the limitations of her physical power.\"\nDrexel smiled, relieved as if a weight had been lifted from his heart, \"That’s good, I can rest easy now.\"\nSheer seemed to have recalled something. He joked, \"Now that your sister’s Psychic Incarnations have finally awakened, it means she could also qualify to inherit the Kering family. That might shake up your position as the heir.\"\nDrexel laughed affectionately yet helplessly, \"You know, I’ve never really cared about that. I just don’t want my sister to be bound by the family obligations either. It’s a pity that our big brother hasn’t awakened his Psychic Incarnation; otherwise, I’d be more than glad to pass that burden to him.\"\n\"Do you think your brother knows you’re trying to set him up?\" Sheer rolled his eyes.\n\"He wouldn’t mind,\" Drexel replied with a mischievous grin. Then he continued on his way to his dorm.\nIn each generation of the five noble families, there would be one person naturally awakening their Psychic Incarnation when they were born.\nOnly those who had awakened their Psychic Incarnation could control the ultimate mechas passed down through their families.\nThese individuals would be recognized by the five noble families as the heirs.",

      "content": "Chapter 59: Badge Collecting\nThe next day, the usual training ground was packed with military students due to the contest.\nSurprisingly, many members of the Fifth Legion had also shown up.\nArix was standing among the students of the Hecaris Military Academy.\nWhen she counted the number of soldiers, she was shocked to find that there were nearly a hundred people from the Fifth Legion.\nShe knew something must be off. They wouldn’t just send so many soldiers here to see students competing with each other.\nTaking a deep breath, Arix prepared herself mentally. Her intuition told her that today’s competition would not be as simple as she thought; it would definitely be full of surprises.\n\"Arix, stay close to me during the competition, I’ll take care of you,\" Rei said seriously, with a hint of worry in her eyes.\n\"You can also come with me,\" Maya smiled as always, like a warm senior.\n\"I can help, too,\" Lilou pushed her glasses up and offered.\n\"If you don’t mind, you can join me as well,\" Leyla said, her delicate face lighting up with a smile. She just made the whole world brighter.\n\"And me too,\" Calista added, her eyes earnest and firm as she looked at Arix.\nRei and the others did not yet know that Arix’s physical power had improved, so they were all worried about her upcoming challenges.\nSeeing her roommates caring for her, Arix felt a warmth spread across her chest. She assured them, \"Thank you all, but my physical power has already broken through to Star-Class, so I will be fine in this competition.\"\nAt Arix’s words, all her roommates stared at her with wide, astonished eyes.\nRei gasped in amazement, her eyes sparkling with curiosity, \"Wow, Arix, how did you improve so quickly? Do you have any tips for us?\"\n\"There’s no secret really. I had some damage in my physical foundation, which got repaired at the legion a few days ago, and that’s why my physical power increased so quickly,\" Arix explained, tapping Rei on the forehead with her finger.\n\"Ah, I see,\" Rei realized, and then happily congratulated her, \"Congratulations, Arix! You won’t have to worry about physical training anymore.\"\n\"Thank you,\" Arix said softly, touched by her roommates’ joy. Suddenly, she remembered something. Rei and Maya, both from Planet Waste, probably had some foundational physical issues due to their poor conditions.\nJust to be safe, she decided to learn how to make Star-Class physical boosters after the training ended, planning to surprise them later.\nWith a smile, Arix joined her roommates in looking towards the podium, quietly waiting for the competition to start.\n\"The head of the instructors, please come forward,\" said the training base manager, Aden.\nOrtiz and other instructors walked up to Aden and saluted. Then Ortiz said clearly, \"Sir, everyone is present.\"\nAden nodded. Then he took out five sets of documents and handed them to Ortiz and the others. \"Here are the documents for today’s contest. Please review them and carry out the instructions within half an hour.\"\n\"Yes, sir.\" Ortiz took the documents, looked them over himself first, and then passed them to Virtanen and Bauer.\n\"Isn’t this a bit difficult?\" Virtanen said sympathetically after reading the documents.\n\"Who came up with these? Aren’t they afraid of being kidnapped by students in the restroom?\" Bauer rarely agreed with Virtanen.\n\"I think it’s fine. They would have to face this sooner or later. We’re just speeding things up a bit,\" Ortiz raised his eyebrows, his tone carrying a hint of interest.\n\"Should we contact a psychologist first? I think a lot of students will have some mental issues today,\" Bauer seriously suggested.\nOrtiz raised his wrist, showing his opticomputer and smiled. \"I’ve already contacted them. I do have a bit of sympathy. Enough talk, now it’s time to collect the students’ Space Buttons. Let’s distribute these cards too.\"\nAfter speaking, Ortiz led the instructors back to the Hecaris Military Academy’s side. They following the document, collecting Space Buttons and other items that could aid in the contest.\nAfter collecting everything, they distributed a badge-collecting card to each student.\n\"Sir, what is this for?\" a curious student asked, holding the card.\nOrtiz’s mouth curved into a rare, kind smile. \"Don’t worry, you’ll find out soon.\"\n\"Okay, thank you.\" The student was surprised to receive a smile from Ortiz and felt rather flattered.\nHe was even thinking to himself that the instructors seemed quite gentle today.\nOnce all the students from the five military academies were ready, Aden finally spoke from the podium. \"Hello, everyone! Today is our weekly training contest. The contest is simple. You all see the card in your hand, right? The badge location on the back of the card will update to the next point after you collect a badge. The goal is to collect five badges to complete the contest. The faster you collect them, the higher your score. The first ten to collect all badges will receive an extra ten points. No more talking, I now declare the contest officially started!\"\nAs soon as the competition started, the students scattered instantly, each heading to the locations indicated on the backs of their cards to collect badges.\nArix quickly ran towards the first badge point, which was the cafeteria.\nAlong the way, she passed a few students with the same goal, and she felt unusually calm, making her wonder if she had been overly concerned earlier.\nIt seemed like today’s contest wouldn’t have any surprises after all.\nHowever, as soon as she reached the entrance of the cafeteria, Arix knew her worry is coming true.\nAt the door, there was a long table with ten large bowls filled with various disgusting things. Each bowl was attended by a chef who was energetically encouraging the students, \"Taste all ten kinds of lovingly prepared dishes and get your badge stamped. What are you waiting for? Get moving!\"\nThe chef at the first bowl on the left had a bowl full of live worms. Trying to suppress his excitement, he smiled benignly at the students, harmless as an old lady, \"Eat up, eat up. It’s very nutritious, just a bit ugly, that’s all.\"\nOne student had psyched himself up for a while before he finally mustered the courage to approach. But as soon as he saw the greasy, sticky worms and smelled the earthy odor they emitted, he completely broke down and rushed to the side, retching.\nHis miserable state caused the surrounding students to step back in disgust. Some students even turned around and gave up on the cafeteria’s badge, deciding to collect the other badges first. They would later decide whether to sacrifice their dignity for victory or to give up winning to save their dignity.",

      "content": "Chapter 60: Disgusting Food\nArix was also struggling with the decision of whether to eat the ten disgusting dishes. If she didn’t, the devilish chefs wouldn’t give her a badge.\nThinking of this, Arix gritted her teeth and was about to go forward when she suddenly remembered Cupid from her psychic world.\nArix’s eyes shifted as she tried calling out to Cupid in her mind. \"Cupid, can you hear me?\"\nCupid, who was bored and spinning in circles in the psychic world, stopped and looked around. He thought Arix had come to play.\n\"Arix, where are you? I can’t see you,\" Cupid said, confused.\n\"Cupid, I’m not in the psychic world. I wanted to ask if you can eat real food,\" Arix asked, feeling a bit guilty.\nAfter saying this, Arix felt so ashamed she wanted to hide. She felt like she was tricking a child and was overwhelmed with guilt.\n\"I can’t eat real things right now. Is someone bothering you, Arix? Do you want me to beat them up for you?\" Cupid said fiercely.\n\"No one is bothering me. It’s just that there’s food here I don’t want to eat,\" Arix said, distressed because she really couldn’t bring herself to eat the worms.\n\"If you don’t like it, why eat it?\" Cupid asked, tilting his head in confusion.\nArix was about to explain when Sophia, who couldn’t stand it any longer, interrupted, \"If you don’t like it, why not let Cupid wrap it in psychic power, and you can spit it out when no one’s around?\"\n\"Oh! That sounds like a god plan. Sophia, you’re brilliant,\" Arix exclaimed happily.\nThen, without hesitation, Arix walked up to the first dish and said to the chef, \"Chef, I’m ready to take on the challenge.\"\nThe chef was initially confused, but upon hearing Arix’s declaration, he quickly perked up and excitedly said, \"Alright!\"\nHe picked up a small plate, grabbed an earthworm with tongs, and passed it to Arix along with a knife and a fork.\nArix’s hands trembled slightly as she took the plate. She mustered all her courage to pick up the wriggling earthworm with the fork and said with a whimper to Cupid, \"Cupid, are you ready?\"\n\"Arix, no problem. Go ahead and eat; I promise the earthworm won’t touch you,\" Cupid encouraged her.\n\"Okay,\" Arix replied, then closed her eyes and quickly threw the earthworm into her mouth.\nThe moment the earthworm entered her mouth, Cupid wrapped it up and stored it temporarily in her stomach. Before Arix could even feel anything, Cupid had already finished the job.\n\"Cupid, you’re amazing,\" Arix said with sparkling eyes of joy.\n\"I know, right?\" Cupid blushed with pride as he excitedly rolled around in the psychic world.\n\"Cupid, there are nine more to go. Can you still do it?\" Arix asked nervously, looking at the next nine bowls.\n\"No problem at all,\" Cupid replied confidently.\n\"Alright, let’s get to the next one,\" Arix said. She walked to the next plate, staring at the bowl of cockroach soup and regretting ever having such clear sights.\nRetching slightly, Arix used the same method—wrapping the food with psychic power before placing it in her stomach.\nThe next eight dishes were: witchetty grubs, maggot puree, roasted scorpion, bat soup, raw fish eyeballs, baby mice, and fried spiders.\nThe students watching were all shocked, not knowing that Arix was only pretending to eat. They truly thought she had swallowed the food.\n\"Is Arix really that... I can’t find the word... that perverish?\" one student whispered.\n\"Isn’t she too harsh on herself?\" another muttered.\n\"And she was the first woman to earn a military rank among us, truly terrifying,\" another commented.\nArix ignored the surrounding voices, fearing that even a second’s pause would ruin everything. After finally dealing with the last fried spider, she clutched her mouth, her face twisted as she handed over the card to the chef who had the badges.\nThe chef took the card and stamped it with a badge, somewhat moved, \"You’re the first to complete the challenge here, congratulations!\"\nArix didn’t want to say anything. She took her card and rushed to the bathroom as if her pants were on fire.\nThose at the entrance of the cafeteria watched in admiration as Arix left. Soon, a few bold youngsters gathered their courage and stood in front of the first chef.\nThey finally dared to put the earthworms in their mouths. Whether it was psychological or not, they felt as if the earthworms were still wriggling inside their mouths.\nSome people, upon experiencing the daunting challenge of eating disgusting food, broke down mentally. They vomited and then angrily tore off their digital bracelets, choosing to quit the competition.\nAfter Arix had a severe bout of vomiting in the bathroom, she finally came out looking drained, as if a monster had sucked all the vitality out of her.\nShe leaned against a tree to catch her breath for a while. Then, she shakily picked up her card, and looked at the address for the next badge collection point.\nUpon recognizing the location, she had a slight smile on her lips. She was surprised that it was an easy spot to earn a badge.\n\"Hypnosis Training Center, huh?\" Arix murmured as if reminiscing, and then she headed towards the psychic power training ground.\nAs soon as she arrived at the Hypnosis Training Center, Arix was about to enter when she was stopped by an instructor.\n\"Sir, can I help you?\" Arix looked puzzled at the instructor.\n\"You’re Arix, right?\" the instructor from the Hypnosis Training Center asked.\n\"Yes...\" Arix responded, slightly confused.\n\"Just hand me your card, and I’ll stamp your badge right away,\" the instructor said, relieved that he had stopped the correct person.\n\"Sir, isn’t it a bit improper for us to be so blatantly skipping the process?\" Arix said, though her actions contradicted her words as she promptly handed over her card.\nThe instructor from the Hypnosis Training Center gave her a stiff, insincere smile, and quickly stamped the badge onto her card. As he handed back the card, his expression almost seemed to say, \"The badge is given, now you can leave, and please never come back.\"\nThis wasn’t an exaggeration on the instructor’s part. Not long ago, Arix had made such a significant impact at the hypnosis room that a saying became popular there: \"Hypnotizing others takes time, but hypnotizing Arix takes half of your life.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 61: Holographic Training Center\nNowadays, no instructor would willingly attempt to hypnotize Arix.\nThis was especially true after the incident with Captain Cantet, who ended up spending several weeks in the military hospital recovering.\nAdditionally, the current competition at the Hypnosis Training Center was merely to identify if any of the students were spies.\nGiven Arix’s status as the sole legitimate heiress of the Kering family, the likelihood of her being a spy was virtually nil.\nConsequently, the instructor at the Hypnosis Training Center simply turned a blind eye and stamped her card with a badge.\nAfter receiving the card from the instructor, Arix walked away, touching her nose awkwardly as she did.\nIt seemed the story of Captain Cantet’s ordeal had spread throughout the Hypnosis Training Center. Otherwise, Arix, who considered herself quite likable, wouldn’t have sensed such evident disdain from the instructor.\nShrugging off the slight, Arix looked at her card, now adorned with two badges. She felt a bit consoled. Disdain or not, as long as she had her lovely badges, it was fine by her.\n\"Now, where’s the next badge?\" Arix wondered aloud, flipping the card to check the location of the third badge.\nHolographic Training Center\n\"Holographic? What kind of training is that?\" Arix was puzzled but decided it was best to check it out in person. The Holographic Training Center was also located within the psychic training grounds, and she arrived there shortly.\nTo her surprise, Drexel was also there. Upon seeing Arix, he provocatively waved his card, which also had two badge stamps, in front of her.\n\"Arix, you might as well give up now,\" Drexel taunted with a smug laugh.\n\"Don’t you think it’s a bit early to be saying that, dude?\" Arix retorted, flashing her own two-badge card.\nThe surrounding students, unintentionally caught in their verbal crossfire, silently hugged their badge-less cards and sadly moved away from the pair.\nAfter a brief comparison of their cards, Arix and Drexel snorted coldly at each other and put away their cards. Then, they turned their attention to the Holographic Training Center.\n\"Why don’t you go in first?\" Drexel offered, his politeness obviously feigned.\n\"Thank you, I will,\" Arix replied, not really appreciating his insincerity, and walked into the Holographic Training Center with a forced smile.\nDrexel paused, a bit taken aback by Arix’s blunt demeanor. Then he shook his head with a smirk and followed her inside.\nUpon seeing them coming in, the instructor at the Center pointed to two small rooms and said, \"Stay inside for half an hour, and you’ll earn your badge.\"\n\"Alright,\" Arix and Drexel responded.\nThey entered their respective rooms, and as soon as they did, the instructor shut the doors behind them.\nArix was shocked to find that the small room was a Connective Device, where her Psychic Incarnation was sharing experiences and pain with a soldier who had been captured by criminals.\nThe gruesome details of the torture—the flaying, nose cutting, eight fingers chopped off, eyes crushed, and five ribs smashed—were vividly felt by Arix. The soldier had been forced to stay awake throughout the ordeal with the help of stimulants, denying him even the mercy of unconsciousness.\nWhen the half-hour was up, the instructor opened the door. He found Arix with clenched fists, her lips bitten to bleeding.\n\"Time’s up, you can come out now,\" the instructor stated calmly.\nArix ignored him, her eyes bloodshot, and asked hoarsely, \"Is this person still alive?\"\nThe instructor finally looked at Arix properly, affirming firmly yet soothingly, \"Alive! He’s now happy, with a wife and children.\"\n\"That’s good,\" Arix said, her tense emotions relaxing as tears uncontrollably streamed down her face.\nDrexel came out of his pod and immediately rushed to his sister’s. After giving a respectful military salute to the instructor, he hugged Arix, offering silent comfort.\nAt that moment, the competition meant nothing to Drexel; his sister’s well-being was all that mattered.\nArix didn’t resist; she cried heart-wrenchingly in her brother’s arms, releasing all her feelings of helplessness.\nAfter a while, her emotions finally stabilized.\nTogether, they walked out of the Holographic Training Center, their cards newly stamped with the badge.\n\"Arix, I concede. You win this time; let’s withdraw,\" Drexel said, unable to bear the thought of his beloved sister undergoing more suffering.\nArix’s tears nearly broke his heart, and he didn’t want to feel so helpless again. To him, her tears were the most potent weapon—hitting straight to the heart with overwhelming force.\nBut Arix was not moved by his words; instead, her anger surged from zero to a hundred. \"Drexel! How dare you say that? That’s almost insulting to me!\" she demanded, her eyes flaming with fury.\n\"I—I meant it for your good...\" Drexel stammered, taken aback by his sister’s explosive anger.\nAlthough frightened, he still tried to explain with a tinge of hurt in his voice.\nFor the first time, Arix lost control of her emotions in anger, \"For my good? How could you say that? Are you trying to make me feel guilty? In the future, you won’t just be my brother; you’ll be an admiral of the Fifth Legion, an admiral of the entire Alliance. I want to be your companion, not a burden that drags you down, understand?\"\n\"But you are my only sister; I can’t bear to see you going through that much,\" Drexel replied weakly. Then, fearful of making his sister even angrier, he nervously glanced at Arix a few times.\n\"Ha, I was just making a presumption. Do you really think I’d just be your companion? No, I’ll be much more than that,\" Arix said sarcastically. Then she turned and walked away.\nBefore she left, Arix coldly dropped another line, \"If one day you become weaker than me, I wouldn’t mind taking someone else as my companion, or even my brother.\"\nNow it was Drexel’s turn to explode in anger, and the more he thought about it, the angrier he got.\n\"What the hell, Arix! What do you mean? Besides me and Kellan, who else do you want as your brother?\" he shouted after Arix. \"Just because you’re better than me? I’ll show you in a minute. I’ll be your brother, being stronger than you for now and forever!\"\nAs Arix walked away, she didn’t look back. She raised her hand and waved it behind her, as if to say, \"We’ll see about that.\"\nOut of Drexel’s sight, the corners of Arix’s mouth curled up slightly in a smirk.",

      "content": "Chapter 62: The Ultimate Plan\nArix enjoyed showing off, but she regretted it later. She wished she hadn’t said anything to Drexel.\nAfter dealing with the third badge point, Arix wanted to give up. But she had already bragged to Drexel.\nSo, she had to keep trying.\nArix sighed deeply and looked at the fourth badge point on the card.\nThis badge point was behind the training base.\nArix saw many dirty, injured students coming from the badge point. Her throat felt tight, and she swallowed nervously, scared as she watched each student walk by.\nThe more she looked, the more frightened she felt.\n’Why is a simple competition so dangerous? Why are they looking at me with pitiful gaze?’\nArix felt like crying. She looked away, afraid she would lose the courage to move forward if she kept looking.\nThe closer she got to the badge point, the more numb she felt.\nWhen she finally reached the badge point and saw the grinning instructor, Arix wore a blank, emotionless face.\n\"Hey, another one! Don’t look so serious. Don’t worry, this is going to be easy for you,\" the instructor said with a smile.\nIf she hadn’t seen all those injured students, she might have believed him.\nLater, she realized that the instructors who smiled the most were usually the toughest.\n\"You just need to walk up this path to the top of the hill. There, you’ll find the guy with the badge. See? Simple,\" the instructor said sincerely, his face looking honest.\nNo wonder so many students came here! They must have been fooled by his Oscar-worthy performance, thinking this one was easy\nArix nodded coldly and started up the hill.\nThe path was eerie and quiet, with only a few crows cawing, making it feel like night.\nArix stayed alert, watching her surroundings.\n\"Bang!\"\n\"Ouch! It hurt!\" Arix gasped in pain as she held her head; she had been hit by a rock.\nBefore she could check around, more rocks flew at her.\n\"Damn! Can’t you just wait for a sec?\" Arix yelled. She quickly put up a psychic power shield to block the rocks and sighed in relief.\nBut it would take at least two hours to reach the top, and she couldn’t keep her psychic power up that long.\nArix thought for a moment and started calling Vita in the psychic world.\n\"Vita, can you help me knock away these stones?\" Arix asked.\n\"Sure,\" Vita agreed without hesitation.\n\"I can help too!\" Cupid said eagerly, not wanting to be left out.\nArix didn’t want Cupid’s help because Cupid used too much psychic power, even though his attacks were the strongest. She wanted to save her psychic power, so she chose Vita instead of using the psychic power shield.\nBut she didn’t want to say this directly to Cupid. After thinking for a moment, Arix said gently, \"Cupid, let Vita handle the simple things. I’ll call you when it gets tough, okay?\"\nCupid, feeling proud as if he was stronger, blushed and nodded. \"Okay, Arix. Just call me if you need me.\"\n\"No problem,\" Arix said, relieved, and promised cheerfully.\nAfter calming Cupid, Arix instructed Vita to knock away the attacking stones. Then she quickly ran towards the top of the hill.\nAlong the way, besides stones, there were deep pits on the ground, choking ropes from above, and various other traps...\nAfter running halfway up the hill, she heard gunshots.\nArix skillfully dodged a few bullets and looked towards the source of the gunshots.\nShe saw a few figures quickly leaving.\nArix frowned. If she wasn’t mistaken, those people looked like soldiers from the Fifth Legion.\nIt seemed this badge point challenge was getting more interesting.\nMeanwhile, a few Fifth Legion soldiers were discussing Arix.\n\"Sergeant, this kid is too strong! We can’t stop her at all.\"\n\"And her psychic power seems endless. We’ve been draining it for so long, but she’s not showing any signs of exhaustion.\"\n\"Yeah, she’s almost at the top. If this continues, we’ll be the first squad to be beaten by a student in history.\"\n\"Sergeant, what should we do next?\"\nThe soldiers looked at their sergeant, waiting for his decision.\nThe sergeant listened to his team and was silent for a moment. Finally, he spoke with a determined and serious look, \"It seems we have to initiate the ultimate plan!\"\n\"What’s the ultimate plan? I don’t know about it.\"\n\"Yeah, sergeant, when did we get an ultimate plan?\"\nThe soldiers were confused and asked their sergeant.\n\"The ultimate plan is...\" The sergeant said mysteriously, looking at his teammates.\nThe sergeant suddenly opened his opticomputer. He operated it with a blank expression and said, \"The ultimate plan is, of course, to call for backup. Only a fool would keep fighting a losing battle.\"\nThe Alliance soldiers were all speechless, watching their sergeant call for backup right in front of them, for the fear of a younger.\nFor some reason, they all felt like children who, unable to win a fight, had run home to call their brothers and sisters. It was a bit embarrassing, but they didn’t seem to have other options.\nThe backup arrived very quickly.\nIn less than three minutes, three young lieutenants silently appeared.\nThe leader was a young woman with a delicate face, but that pretty face seemed cold. The other two were also young, and they both seemed very dangerous.\nWhen the soldiers and the sergeant saw the backup, they immediately saluted and shouted, \"Sir!\"\nThey seemed very respectful; they didn’t underestimate the young reinforcements because of their age.\nThe three lieutenants returned the salute. Then the only female, Rhea, spoke calmly, \"Tell me, why did you call us?\"\n\"Lieutenant, we had a top student. We couldn’t stop her, so we requested your support,\" the sergeant said, feeling a bit ashamed.\n\"Oh? Show me her file,\" Rhea said, her cold eyes showing a hint of interest.\n\"Yes, ma’am!\" the sergeant said. Then he opened his opticomputer and projected Arix’s file as a hologram.\n\"Huh, it’s Arix. I’ve been wanting to meet her,\" Rhea said with a cold smile, her face becoming even colder, as if she had met an enemy.\nThe Alliance soldiers and the sergeant suddenly felt uneasy, as if they had unintentionally brought a serious enemy to Arix.\n\"Tane, Novak, let’s go!\" Rhea said. Then the three of them rushed towards Arix’s location.\nThe remaining soldiers and the sergeant looked at each other, awkwardly. After a while, one of the soldiers hesitantly said, \"I have a feeling this lieutenant wants to settle a personal score with Arix.\"\n\"You have a ’feeling’? That expression on her face was clear as day!\" the sergeant sighed.\nThe soldiers exchanged glances. Then one of them curiously asked, \"Sergeant, you know something about it, don’t you?\"\n\"I just remembered,\" the sergeant said, rubbing his forehead, \"Arix is the student who sent Captain Cantet to the hospital a few days ago. lieutenant Rhea is his sister, and she’s known for being very protective of him.\"\nHearing this, the soldiers immediately understood what was happening. They suddenly all felt sorry for Arix.\nMeanwhile, Arix was nearing the mountaintop, but before she could celebrate, she suddenly stopped and looked warily in a certain direction.\n\"Vita, switch to Cupid,\" Arix thought.\n\"Okay,\" Vita said. The Psychic Incarnation around Arix changed to Cupid.\n\"Arix, where are the bad guys?\" Cupid shook excitedly. To others, it looked like Arix was controlling psychic power that swirled around her.\n\"Just be careful. They’re already here,\" Arix said. As soon as she spoke, three high-ranking Alliance officers appeared in front of her.\n\"Are you Arix?\" Rhea looked Arix up and down with disdain.\n\"Yes, I am. Who are you?\" Arix asked, confused.\nShe had sensed a deep hostility even before these people arrived, which is why she had switched from Vita to Cupid. She expected to encounter insectoids, but instead, it was a strange young woman filled with intense hostility towards her.\n\"Hmph! As long as you’re Arix, that’s all that matters. I don’t want to accidentally hit the wrong person,\" Rhea said. Then she stopped paying attention to Arix and turned to her companions, \"I can handle this alone. You two stay out of it.\"\nTane and Novak exchanged a glance and nodded, stepping back from the battlefield.",

      "content": "Chapter 63: Competition Over\nWithout wasting any more words, Rhea moved like lightning towards Arix, her psychic power forming into blades aimed at Arix’s limbs.\nShe wouldn’t forgive anyone who bullied her brother.\nJust as Reah was very protective of Cantet, Cupid was protective of Arix.\nAnyone who bullied Arix was a bad person in Cupid’s eyes. And bad people deserved to be punished.\nCupid began to turn deep red. He shifted from a harmless little beast to almost a bloodthirsty monster.\nFacing Rhea’s psychic power and the \"bad person,\" Cupid protected Arix, using his psychic power like a whip. He not only shattered Rhea’s psychic blades but also lashed at Rhea’s abdomen.\nThis was the first time Arix saw Cupid in combat, and she was surprised by his strength. If Sophia and Vita joined in, the other two lieutenant wouldn’t stand a chance either.\nWhile Arix felt at ease, Rhea kept trying various attacks after dodging the strike to her abdomen. But every attempt was blocked by Arix’s psychic power.\nRhea’s eyes were almost freezing over, especially when she saw Arix watching the fight as if it were a show. She gritted her teeth in anger and intensified her attacks.\nWatching from the side, Tane and Novak were amazed by Arix’s combat abilities. Rhea had recently graduated as a top student from the Hecaris Military Academy, but now she couldn’t defeat this freshman?—That’s absurd.\nArix, however, wasn’t feeling as easy as she seemed. As Rhea’s attacks got fiercer and fiercer, Arix’s physical power could no longer sustain Cupid’s intense actions.\n\"Cupid, use your strongest attack to knock her out,\" Arix said, trying to ignore her body’s discomfort.\n\"Okay,\" Cupid understood Arix’s situation. If this continued, Arix’s body might collapse first. So, Cupid didn’t hold back and used his strongest attack, hitting Rhea and making her fall unconscious instantly.\nAs Rhea fell, Tane and Novak caught her and checked her condition. After confirming she was not seriously hurt, Tane looked up at Arix and said, \"You won. You can go.\"\nArix retracted Cupid and nodded at them expressionlessly. Then she continued towards the mountaintop.\nOnce she was out of their sight, Arix immediately coughed up a large mouthful of blood.\n\"It seems that Star-Class physical power is still a bit too much for me,\" Arix muttered, wiping the blood from her mouth with her sleeve, feeling a bit frustrated.\nShe wiped the blood from her mouth and placed her right hand on her left wrist, feeling her pulse for a moment.\nWhen her pulse slowed down, she breathed a sigh of relief and put her hand down.\nShe joked to herself, \"Maybe this is what they mean by ’if you don’t treat it, it heals on its own.’\"\nEver since her physical power upgraded, Arix felt not only stronger in battle but also noticed that her body healed faster. This was just Star-Class physical power. If she upgraded to Supergiant-Class physical power in the future, she might become an unstoppable force.\nArix thought about this for a while. Then she looked firmly toward the top of the mountain. It was time to get the fourth badge. With that thought, she continued climbing.\nThe journey was unusually calm. There were no traps, no ambushes, and no harsh instructors. Before long, Arix successfully obtained the fourth badge.\nOn her way down, Arix saw some freshmen near the exit, laughing happily.\n\"Looks like the instructor wasn’t lying. It might really be easy; see, she already came out,\" one said.\n\"Yeah, the instructor didn’t seem like someone who would lie,\" another agreed.\nOne cautious student asked Arix, \"Did you get the badge?\"\nArix realized the student was talking to her. She raised an eyebrow but said nothing, just showed the card with the four badge symbols on it.\nThe cautious student sighed in relief, thanked Arix, and headed toward the mountain top with the others, thinking maybe he was too suspicious.\nArix stayed there for a moment, feeling sympathetic for the students climbing the mountain. Then she quickly left, still nervous about being an impostor. She worried the students’ angry spirits might come looking for her if she stayed too long.\nArix thought to herself,\n’Even dragon slayers become dragons eventually. I can’t believe I’m loving fooling others around now.’\nOnce she confirmed the area was safe, Arix slowed her pace and laughed at her childish behavior. Feeling better, she took out the card and looked at the location of the fifth badge.\n\"Training ground?\" Arix was confused. She rubbed her eyes and looked again to make sure she saw it correctly.\n’That’s the starting point. How could it be a badge location?’\nCurious and puzzled, Arix decided to go back to the training ground to find out.\nWhen Arix returned to the training ground, she easily found the fifth badge point by following the hints on the card. She was surprised to see that the instructor at this badge point was none other than her own instructor, Ortiz.\nOrtiz saw Arix and smiled with a mix of surprise and satisfaction. \"You came back quite fast. Is it just my badge that you need now?\"\n\"Yes, it’s just the last badge left. Sir, tell me how I can get the badge from you,\" Arix said carefully, ready for a challenge.\n\"Take out your card,\" Ortiz said with a mysterious smile.\nArix almost thought she had misheard but instinctively handed over the card. In the next second, the missing badge symbol appeared on her card, completed by Ortiz’s badge.\nThe card then transformed, showing the number 8 on the front and the dire wolf emblem of the Hecaris Military Academy on the back.\n\"Sir... is this... kind of cheating really okay?\" Arix stammered nervously, looking at the changed card in shock.\nOrtiz, veins popping on his forehead, couldn’t hold back and knocked Arix on the head. \"Gosh, why do you think we’re cheating? Am I really that bad in your eyes?\"\nArix, holding her head in pain, pouted but dared not argue. She thought to herself,\n’Sorry, but I thought you might be.’\nShe never said it out aloud, though.\n\"The fifth badge point can be the hardest or the easiest,\" Ortiz said, feeling the need to explain for the sake of his reputation.\nArix listened carefully.\n\"For the fifth badge point, the main task is to earn the instructor’s approval. Understand?\" Ortiz said.\nArix nodded. She finally understood. This point was designed to ensure that even if a student couldn’t get any badges, they would still get one as a consolation.\nNo wonder this badge point seemed like a freebie compared to the first four. The academy was kind, but only to a certain extent.\nAfter this, Arix had a lot of free time. She just had to stay at the training ground and wait for the competition to end. During this time, she saw many familiar faces returning, most of them looking battered and exhausted.\nEven Drexel returned with a gloomy face, looking as if he had been through a rough time. He looked even more frustrated when he saw Arix.\nDrexel was so disappointed at himself that he felt like coughing up blood. Even getting the easy badge from the instructor didn’t improve his mood much.\nNot giving up, Drexel walked over to Arix and asked cautiously, \"Arix, did you get all your badges?\"\nArix smiled slightly and nodded, pretending to be modest. \"Yes, and I finished eighth, so dear, you lost.\"\nDrexel’s expression became even gloomier. After hesitating for a moment, he asked, \"Arix, how did you get through the badge point in the cafeteria?\"\nThis question darkened Arix’s face as well. Drexel didn’t need to ask further to know he had touched a sore spot.\nBut Drexel felt his pain was worse. He would lose his opticomputer from now on. At this moment, he felt a strange sense of desolation, as if he had lost everything.\nIn this competition, the hardest badge points were the cafeteria and the mountain top. If they had a choice, both Arix and Drexel would choose to tackle the mountain top ten times rather than go to the cafeteria once again.",

      "content": "Chapter 64: Sister Gwen\nAfter the training competition ended, the next two days were the much-anticipated weekend rest days for the students.\nOn Saturday, nearly all the students chose to go to the bedmaker to retrieve their opticomputers. Then, they contacted their family and friends.\nArix also went to the bedmaker and got back her opticomputer. In addition to the one she won from Drexel in the bet, Arix now had two opticomputers.\nHowever, since Drexel’s opticomputer was a bit shady, Arix decided not to use it and instead hid it in her Space Button.\nBut Arix was overjoyed to see her own opticomputer, treating it like a long-lost girlfriend, even giving it a little kiss.\nAs for who to contact first?\nArix had already decided—it had to be Sister Gwen and the seven little darlings!\nAfter returning to the dorm with the opticomputer, Arix found that her roommates were all having video calls with their own friends and family. Everyone was considerate enough not to disturb each other.\nArix walked quietly to her bed, sat down, and started contacting Sister Gwen.\nFirst, Arix turned on the opticomputer. Her fingers swiped down the virtual screen for a while before finding Sister Gwen’s contact icon. Arix tapped the video call button.\nThe ringing didn’t last long. Sister Gwen, far away on Planet Waste, quickly answered the call.\nSeeing the familiar, kind face on the 3D virtual screen, Arix beamed and sweetly called out, \"Sister, it’s me, Arix.\"\n\"I knew! Arix! How was training? Were you good? Did you hurt yourself? Was it tough?\" Sister Gwen asked with concern.\nArix patiently answered each question.\nSister Gwen was delighted by the answers but then sighed a bit, saying, \"Arix, tell your mom not to send me more stuff. The storage is already full.\"\nIn fact, Fleur’s packages were just fine, but Sister Gwen was used to being frugal, so she couldn’t bear to use most of the things, and they just kept piling up.\nArix’s eyes sparkled with amusement. Pretending to be troubled, she said, \"But if Mom doesn’t send stuff, she’ll be upset. What should we do? Sister, maybe you could work on using up some of the stuff in the storage?\"\nSister Gwen saw right through Arix’s little trick and chuckled, \"I’m not senile yet, you little rascal. Fine, fine, let her send what she wants. I will just enjoy it for once.\"\n\"That’s the right way to think. We’re not around to take care of you. If you don’t even care about yourself, we’ll be so worried,\" Arix said, her tone full of affection.\n\"Here we go, you and your endless reasoning. I can’t win against you,\" Sister Gwen said with a teasing smile.\n\"That’s because what I say makes sense!\" Arix replied with a playful hum, feeling quite pleased with herself.\nThen Arix remembered that she hadn’t seen the seven little ones today and asked with some confusion, \"Sister, where are the kids? Why haven’t I seen them today?\"\n\"They’re still in class next door,\" Sister Gwen replied, her tone softening as she talked about the children.\n\"That’s fine, studying matters most. I’ll see them next time.\" Arix continued chatting with Sister Gwen for a while longer before ending the video call.\nArix spent the rest of the morning video chatting with her family. When her roommates went to the cafeteria for lunch, Arix hesitated for a moment before clicking on the icon for her puppy friend.\nIn no time, the 3D virtual screen lit up, and Cassian’s voice came through.\n\"Arix, how have you been lately?\" Cassian asked with concern.\n\"Not good. The training is tough and exhausting, and there are no fluffy creatures to cuddle,\" Arix complained, hinting at something.\n\"Poor you. Why don’t you come to the Empire? I’ll take care of you, and you can cuddle with me,\" Cassian joked, but there was a hint of seriousness in his tone.\nArix burst out laughing at his words. \"You don’t have to sell yourself like that.\"\n\"So, will you come?\" Cassian asked hopefully, as if he had a tail, it would be wagging.\n\"No, I actually like the Alliance. How about you come to the Alliance? I’ll take care of you. I can groom you and give you massages every day. What do you think? Want to consider it?\" Arix said, raising an eyebrow playfully.\n\"I’d love to, but I can’t leave the Empire right now. Unless you’re not afraid of being chased, how about we elope together?\" Cassian’s eyes sparkled with excitement.\nHearing the word \"chased,\" Arix’s smile froze. She suddenly remembered that the guy on the other end was the crown prince of the Empire. If she really ran off with the future Alpha, it wouldn’t just be a matter of being chased. There could be a full-blown war between the Alliance and the Empire.\nThe more she thought about it, the more horrifying it seemed. Arix shuddered and quickly said with righteous conviction, \"Cassian, we are the pillars of the Empire and the Alliance’s future. We can’t abandon our responsibilities for our own needs! That would be wrong!\"\nArix’s passionate speech left Cassian stunned. But thinking about his countless citizens, he realized Arix was right.\n\"Arix, you’re right. I was being narrow-minded,\" Cassian admitted seriously.\n\"It’s okay. Admitting your mistakes and correcting them is the greatest good,\" Arix said, breathing a sigh of relief as she realized she had successfully talked Cassian out of his crazy idea.\nInwardly, she patted herself on the back. She had just preserved the peace between the Empire and the Alliance!\n\"Your Highness, Your Majesty is looking for you,\" the voice of the Minister of Internal Affairs suddenly sounded outside Cassian’s room.\n\"You should go,\" Arix said considerately, not waiting for Cassian to speak first.\n\"Alright, Arix, goodbye,\" Cassian said reluctantly.\n\"Goodbye,\" Arix replied before ending the video call.\nStaring at the darkened screen, she felt her stomach rumble with hunger. Deciding not to contact anyone else for now, Arix got up and headed to the cafeteria.\nAfter eating, she returned to her dorm and started watching a live stream by a mecha maker.\nAs usual, Arix couldn’t help herself when she got excited or saw something interesting during the stream. She showered the streamer with gifts, causing her support to flood the chat. Before she knew it, Arix had become the top supporter for several novice mecha builders.",

      "content": "Chapter 65: The Insectoid’s Peculiarity\nWhile the students were enjoying their weekend, the air in a certain room at the Fifth Legion Hospital was getting awkward.\n\"You mean it came to you on its own, and Arix didn’t attack you on purpose?!\" Rhea stared wide-eyed, a bit exasperated as she pointed at Cantet in shock.\n\"Yeah? Who told you that Arix attacked me on purpose?\" Cantet asked, confused.\nHe wondered if someone was trying to harm his sister by misleading her into confronting Arix.\nRhea was speechless and accused, \"Every time I asked you, you were dodging the question, so I thought you were scared of the Kering family and didn’t dare to say it.\"\n\"Come on, if I were really afraid of the Kering family, would I have competed with Kellan for so long?\" Cantet felt a bit guilty at first but then puffed out his chest and retorted.\nBut then his gaze started to avoid hers again.\nAfraid his sister would misunderstand further, Cantet decided to explain, \"I tried to hypnotize Arix to see if I could get some dirt on Kellan. Who knew her psychic power level was higher than mine? If my psychic power hadn’t escaped quickly, I’d be in worse shape than just lying in bed for half a month.\"\n\"Hah! Now you’re proud of it?\" Rhea rolled her eyes and then glared at Cantet, gritting her teeth, \"Why didn’t you just explain this from the beginning?\"\nHearing his sister’s accusation, Cantet’s eyes looked a bit pitiful, \"How could I just tell everyone about such an embarrassing failure? It’s so humiliating.\"\n\"So, to save your face, now I’m in the hospital too. Are you happy now?\" Rhea glared at Cantet, who was in the bed next to her.\nCantet turned over, showing his back to Rhea, pulled the blanket over his head, and muttered, \"Fine, fine, I’ll tell you next time, okay?\"\n\"You’re still hiding? Does it help? Now think about how to apologize to Arix.\" Rhea looked at the hiding Cantet, annoyed.\n\"But we’re the ones injured and in the hospital. Why should we apologize?\" Cantet peeked out from under the blanket, looking defiant.\nRhea laughed angrily. She grabbed a pillow and threw it at Cantet, scolding, \"Oh, you’ve got guts, Cantet. Blaming the victim now? If you weren’t my brother, I’d smack you.\"\n\"Fine, fine, I’ll apologize, okay?\" Cantet caught the thrown pillow and reluctantly agreed.\nThen he carefully handed the pillow back to his sister.\n\"Hmph! That’s more like it,\" Rhea said with a satisfied grunt.\nRhea placed the pillow back and lay on the bed in a comfortable position. She casually asked, \"How should we apologize? Should we buy a gift?\"\n\"Seriously, does an apology need a ceremony? Girl, keep it simple, please,\" Cantet was almost breaking down.\nNo one knew who put his sister and him in the same hospital room. He felt like he was being pranked.\nAt the legion hospital, Arix sneezed several times. Rubbing her nose, she thought,\n’It’s getting colder; maybe I should wear an extra layer tomorrow.’\nMeanwhile, at the border where the Fifth Legion was located...\nThe insectoids launched another swarm, attempting to invade the Alliance’s planets.\nFacing the fierce and relentless attack from the insectoids, Kellan led a mothership and twelve warships. They floated firm at the border, like a barrier, keeping the terrifying swarm outside the Alliance territory.\nIn the mothership’s main control room, Kellan observed the large virtual map and commanded the battle mechas on the carrier deck. He coordinated their attacks and retreats based on real-time battlefield information.\n\"501 Mecha Team, support 601 Mecha Team, over.\"\n\"503 Mecha Team, retreat from the battlefield, 603 Mecha Team, fill in, over.\"\n\"505 Mecha Team, watch out, another batch of insectoids incoming, over.\"\n\"505 received, over.\"Kellan finished directing the mecha teams and then began commanding the twelve warships.\n\"All warships, increase firepower! Activate particle beams, activate particle beams!\"\n\"Ship 1, received, over.\"\n\"Ship 2, received, over.\"\n\"Ship 3, received, over.\"\nThe power of the particle beams was equivalent to modern nuclear bombs. Following the commander’s orders, all warships activated their particle beams.\nAccelerators on the warships generated high-energy particles, which then gathered into dense beams. These beams were launched consecutively, hitting large areas of insectoids.\nTime passed minute by minute, and by late afternoon, the swarm started to retreat from the Fifth Legion border.\nAs the insectoids fully withdrew, everyone finally relaxed, breathing a collective sigh of relief.\nIn the mothership’s main control room, Kellan handed over command to other officers. Then, exhausted, he left to rest in their quarters with his deputy, Basell.\nWalking down the corridor of the mothership, Kellan suddenly asked, \"Basell, have there been any unusual activities from the insectoids recently?\"\n\"Sir, the insectoids have been persistently trying to invade the Alliance. Just today’s attack is the third this week. I’m afraid they’ll keep attacking,\" Basell reported the current situation.\n\"What about the other legions?\" Kellan asked after a moment of thought.\n\"Though they also face insectoid swarms, they aren’t nearly as frequent as what the we’re experiencing,\" Basell replied, still somewhat puzzled.\nHearing this, Kellan rubbed his temples, forming a suspicion in his mind.\nIt seemed likely that the insectoids had learned about the Alliance having a Supergiant+ psychic power user—his sister, Arix. For now, they were launching open swarm attacks. But if these direct assaults failed, Kellan feared the insectoids might resort to more covert tactics next.\nAfter all, it was much easier to eliminate a major threat before it fully matured.\nIn contrast to the gunfire and explosions at the border, the training base was peaceful and calm.\nArix yawned as she got out of bed, stretched lazily, and went to the sink to freshen up.\nAfter washing, she felt much more awake and carried the basin back to her dormitory. Just as she was about to put the basin down, her opticomputer on her left wrist suddenly rang.\n\"Hmm?\" Arix was puzzled for a moment. She put the basin into the cupboard and then opened the virtual screen of the opticomputer.",

      "content": "Chapter 66: Double-standard Sims\nSeeing that it was a video call from Smis, Arix quickly answered without delay.\n\"Good afternoon,\" Sims greeted, his eyes shadowed with dark circles. Despite his exhaustion, he forced a smile for his favorite little Moon Pie.\n\"When was the last time you slept?\" Arix asked with a mix of concern and reproach as she looked at Sims on the virtual screen.\n\"Not long, just two days,\" Sims immediately explained, seeing that Arix was unhappy.\nHis explanation only made Arix’s expression darker.\n\"Is the Chemistry Department busy again?\" Arix asked, her face serious.\nShe knew firsthand how demanding the Chemistry Department could be. When things got busy there, it was like people were treated like beasts of burden.\nAlthough Arix was just asking, she was already certain of the answer.\nSims opened his mouth to respond but couldn’t find a way to argue. Finally, he admitted with a sigh, \"Yes, it’s very busy. Recently, the insectoids have been aggressively attacking the Alliance’s borders for some unknown reason. Although the casualties aren’t high, the demand for potions has been increasing.\"\n\"I’m going to ask my instructor for leave right now. Wait for me,\" Arix said, starting to head out of the dormitory. She suddenly paused and turned back to Sims, asking, \"By the way, should I bring my cousin along?\"\n\"You mean Varden? No need. He came here last night,\" Sims said, then turned the screen to show Varden, who was busy working nearby.\nIn the video, Varden’s hair was messy, and his dark circles were so pronounced that even his glasses couldn’t hide them.\nBut when he heard Arix’s words, Varden still took a moment to look up. He looked at Arix and said, \"Yeah, thank you for wanting to assign me more work, I guess?\", his voice dripping with sarcasm.\nHis glare scared Arix a bit, and she quickly turned off the opticomputer.\nShe patted her chest, still feeling nervous. She was glad she hung up fast, or else Varden might have crawled out of the screen to hit her.\nIn the Chemistry Department, Varden looked at the suddenly dark screen and shook his head with a mix of frustration and amusement. \"Varden, be gentle with girls, would you? Or you may be alone for the rest of your life,\" said Sims.\nHe saw his beloved Arix looking scared, and he immediately felt sorry for her and complained to Varden.\n\"Grandpa, does she look scared to you? She’s clearly feeling guilty,\" Varden replied, looking helplessly at his grandfather. It seemed like his grandpa favored Arix so much that he almost thought Arix was his real granddaughter.\n\"Even so, be nice to Moon Pie. She’s suffered too much when she was a kid, after all. You should be more gentle,\" Sims said, looking at Varden as if he didn’t understand.\n\"Then what about cousin Jane? She’s also a girl. Why don’t you treat her gently?\" Varden retorted, staring straight at Sims.\n\"Jane is an exception. Look at her. Does she seem like a girl to you? As a child of our family, she doesn’t study potions and instead went to other department. And not just any department, but the Mecha Combat Department! She’s like a wild tiger, always fighting,\" Sims said through his grifted teeth.\nBefore meeting Arix, Jane was his ideal apprentice, but she insisted on joining the combat department.\n\"They’re both girls. Why make exceptions? Grandpa, you’re being unfair,\" Varden said with disdain.\n\"You cheeky boy, are you itching for a beating? How dare you talk to your grandpa like that?\" Sims glared at him.\n\"...,\" Varden chose to stay silent. He didn’t want to provoke his grandpa any further.\nSeeing his grandson back down, Sims snorted in satisfaction. \"Arix should be here soon. I’ll go meet her. You keep making potions,\" Sims said, his tone softening. Then he happily walked out of the Chemistry Department.\nVarden watched his grandpa leave and rolled his eyes. Then he focused on making potions.\nOutside the Chemistry Department, Arix peeked inside cautiously, afraid of being caught by Varden. After a while, she didn’t see any sign of him and felt relieved. She patted her chest again and walked inside.\n\"You’re here!\" Sims said, looking up from helping a chemist with potion problems. He spotted his beloved Arix and greeted her warmly.\n\"Grandpa Sims! Long time no see. Did you miss me?\" Arix said with a big, playful smile.\n\"Of course I did! From now on, just call me Sims. It sounds closer,\" Sims replied, walking over and gently patting Arix’s head with a kind smile.\n\"Okay,\" Arix nodded obediently. Then she continued, \"Would you take me to the potion room? I want to start making potions right away.\"\n\"Alright, alright. It’s still the same little room from last time. I’ve always kept it for you,\" Sims said, feeling even more pleased with Arix’s diligence.\nHe stroked his chin, thinking once again how he wished such a wonderful girl could be part of the Brant family. He’d even trade his grandson for her; He would agree in a heartbeat!\n...\nThe pharmacy room was still the same as when Arix last visited. It was filled with medical ingredients, making the spacious room feel small and cramped.\nArix stood at the door. She looked at the room packed with medical ingredients and felt like she couldn’t breathe.\nAfter taking a deep breath, Arix adjusted her mindset. Then she asked Sims for a list of potions that needed to be made.\nShe spent the entire afternoon making potions, not stopping until it was dark. It was only when Varden came to knock on the door that Arix stopped her frenzied potion-making.\n\"Time for dinner,\" Varden called, knocking on the door.\n\"Coming,\" Arix replied, glancing at the door.\nWhen she looked down and put the potions away, Arix noticed that her clothes and hands were stained with colorful medical ingredients.\nShe looked like a forest witch with her dirty and messy appearance.\nArix felt a bit distressed and scratched her messy hair. After thinking for a while, she decided to leave it as it was. She would clean up later when she got back.\nHowever, when she saw Varden outside, Arix felt better.\nThe elegant and noble young guy now looked like a mess too. He looked like he had stayed up several nights, with a face full of exhaustion.\nNot only that, but his training clothes were also dirty. He looked like he could start begging if given a bowl.\nArix couldn’t help but laugh at the image in her mind.\n\"Varden, let me give you a mat and a carton. You’ll make a lot of ’money’ looking like this,\" Arix laughed heartily.\nAt first, Varden didn’t understand. When he did, he almost started a fight with her.\n\"Arix, you asked for this,\" Varden said, raising his hand with a fierce look.\nArix’s eyes widened, thinking her cousin was finally going to smack her. She was about to beg for mercy.\nThen she heard a click.\nVarden had used the photo function on his opticomputer to take a picture of her.\n\"Hey, that’s not fair,\" Arix thought, just as she was about to use her opticomputer to take a picture of Varden too. But Varden’s cold voice interrupted her.\n\"Think about it. Who’s faster, you taking the photo or me emailing it to everyone in our family?\" Varden said, like a villain boss, with a cold smile.\n’The whole family? What a ruthless plan!’\nArix couldn’t help but remember the day she returned and everyone in the family took turns gossiping about her.\nArix swallowed and lowered the hand with the opticomputer. She was about to smile apologetically but was interrupted again by Varden.\n\"Wait, don’t smile yet. I still need to eat,\" Varden said, looking away in disgust.\nArix’s smile froze. In her mind, a tiny version of herself angrily beat up Varden, venting all her frustration. She felt much calmer afterward.\nThen she said coolly, \"I won’t take any pictures if you delete yours. We can still be good cousins, or it will be all-out war.\"\nVarden, seeing it was wise to stop, snorted and deleted the photo in front of Arix.\nArix finally relaxed. She and Varden then walked \"lovingly\" to the dining hall, swallowing their pride.",

      "content": "Chapter 67: The Desperate Nyx\nAfter they finished eating, they returned to the Chemistry Department to continue making potions. But they found the entrance blocked.\nA man in a captain’s uniform knelt silently at the door. Next to him lay another man, unconscious, also in a captain’s uniform. But this unconscious man was very thin, with sunken eyes, looking like he was on the brink of death.\nTwo medical staff were trying to persuade the kneeling man, as were the surrounding chemists and soldiers. But the kneeling man ignored them all, like a statue.\nArix and Varden exchanged a glance. Then they both looked at a familiar chemist.\n\"Raiden, what’s going on here?\" Varden pointed to the two men and asked.\nRaiden glanced at the two men and sighed regretfully. \"The kneeling one is Nyx. The one almost dead is Draven. They’re a couple.\"\nA couple?\nArix’s fangirl soul for yaoi awakened, but she suppressed it, knowing this wasn’t the right circumstance.\n\"They’re not just a couple but also the best partners. Sadly, three months ago, Draven was ambushed by an insectoid while saving a child. That’s how he ended up like this,\" Raiden said, full of regret.\n\"Then why didn’t they go to the Legion Hospital instead of coming to the Chemistry Department? Isn’t there a way to save Draven here?\" Arix asked, puzzled.\n\"The hospital couldn’t save him, so how could the Chemistry Department?\" Raiden replied with a bitter face. \"Nyx just thinks that maybe Master Sims can help. He’s holding onto a desperate hope, kneeling here to beg Master Sims to save his mate.\"\n\"But this is the Legion. He’s interfering with the Chemistry Department. The consequences could be severe,\" Varden said, pushing his glasses up and looking at the two men as if they were foolish.\n\"Nyx has no will to live anymore. Why would he care about the consequences? He’s likely to do something drastic once Draven takes his last breath,\" Raiden said confidently, seeming to know them well.\n\"By the way, Raiden, you haven’t said what exactly is wrong with Draven. Why can’t he be cured?\" Arix asked, more concerned about this.\n\"His psychic world was destroyed. There’s no way to heal that. No matter what we do, he’s just waiting to die,\" Raiden explained. Then, unable to bear watching anymore, he shook his head and went back into the Chemistry Department.\nArix and Varden looked at each other again. Then, they both looked worriedly at Nyx and Draven.\nArix had studied mental illness the most. She knew that when the psychic world shattered, it meant a person’s soul had no container. Even Psychic Ware couldn’t help, and death was only a matter of time for Draven.\nMaybe because her lover’s breathing was getting weaker, Nyx finally couldn’t stay still. He bit his lip and shouted towards the Chemistry Department, \"Master Sims, I know you’re there! Please, save my lover! Please, save him!! Save him!!\"\n\"Master Sims!! You are a grandmaster, you must have a way to save him!!\"\n\"Master Sims! I beg you! I will do anything! Just save him! Please!\"\nThe people around watched in silence. Many kind people were already wiping their tears, and some older ones turned away, unable to bear the scene.\nBut Nyx’s desperate cries didn’t bring Sims. Instead, it brought the Legion’s disciplinary team.\n\"Captain, I understand your feelings, but you have to realize that this is the Legion. You are making a mistake,\" the leading officer of the disciplinary team said quietly.\nThis was probably the task the disciplinary team least wanted to carry out because the person dying wasn’t just Nyx’s lover but also their comrade. By stopping Nyx, they were also stopping their comrade’s hope of survival.\nBut the Legion had its rules, which no one could break, even if that person was a dying comrade.\nThe leading officer of the disciplinary team closed his eyes. When he opened them again, they were full of coldness and cruelty.\n\"Take him away!\" the officer ordered coldly.\nThe other six members of the disciplinary team hesitated. They looked at each other, then quietly said, \"Yes, sir!\"\nSeeing the disciplinary team start to act, Nyx finally broke down. This time, he didn’t beg Sims but screamed and cursed, \"Sims, you old fool! Why won’t you save him! Why!\"\n\"Aren’t you a master? Why won’t you save him! Answer me!\"\n\"You are unworthy of your name! Sims! You’re a cold-blood snake!\"\nAs the disciplinary team was about to move Draven, an old man walked out from the Chemistry Department’s door.\nIt was Sims.\n\"Wait!\" Sims called out.\nSims’ appearance surprised everyone. Some even hoped that Draven might be saved.\n\"Master Sims is here.\"\n\"Maybe Draven can be saved now?\"\n\"Not likely, the psychic world is broken. How can he be saved?\"\n\"Yeah, true.\"\nThe disciplinary team stopped. Then, they respectfully saluted Sims, \"Master Sims!\"\n\"Hmm.\" Sims nodded in return. Then, looking at Nyx with regret, he said, \"I’m sorry, I can’t save your lover, but this might help keep him around a bit longer.\"\nSims placed a delicate Psychic Ware necklace around Draven’s neck. After carefully examining Draven’s condition, Sims sighed and shook his head at Nyx.\nThe hope that had briefly lit up in Nyx’s eyes was instantly extinguished. He stopped screaming and struggling, simply holding Draven in silence, his eyes filled with despair.\nThe members of the disciplinary team hesitated, unsure if they should continue. They looked to their commanding officer for direction. The officer was about to give an order when Sims spoke again.\n\"No need, let them leave on their own.\"\nThe officer paused before responding, \"Understood. Let’s go.\" He turned and led the disciplinary team away.\nAfter they left, Sims advised Nyx, \"Take him to the Legion hospital. He might live a bit longer there.\" Then, with a resolute turn, Sims walked back to the Chemistry Department.\nOthers in the crowd sighed and shook their heads as they also began to leave. Soon, only Nyx, holding the unconscious Draven, remained, like a statue.\n\"We should go too,\" Varden said quietly.\nEveryone had given up, including Nyx. No one believed Draven had any chance of surviving.\nBut at that moment, Arix heard a voice—Vita’s voice.\n\"Arix, do you want to save him?\"\nVita had been asleep in her psychic world, and Arix’s intense desire to save Draven had awakened her.\n\"Yes! Vita, do you have a way?\" Arix almost forgot that her psychic world contained three sentient Psychic Incarnations.\nOrdinary people might be powerless, but Vita and the others were different—they had consciousness and might know how to treat mental illnesses.\n\"I don’t know, but we can try,\" Vita said uncertainly. She had never encountered a shattered psychic world before, so she couldn’t guarantee success.\nBut Arix had faith in her. Without hesitation, she said, \"Then let’s try. Having hope is better than having none at all!\"\n\"Okay.\" Vita agreed warmly.\nAfter communicating with Vita, Arix turned to Varden, a hint of excitement in her voice. \"You go back first. I’ll come later.\"\nVarden looked at Arix in surprise. Seeing her expression, he felt a flicker of hope.\n’Does she know how to save the guy?’\nBut then, he dismissed the thought, thinking he was being overly optimistic.\nDraven’s psychic world was shattered. Even his grandfather, the Alliance’s top Master Chemist, had no way to fix it, let alone a young girl. But despite his doubts, Varden was curious to see what Arix intended to do.\nSo Varden kept silent, watching Arix without saying a word.\nLeave? Not a chance. He stood his ground, determined to see this through.",

      "content": "Chapter 68: Arix Helped\nArix looked at Varden, who wasn’t moving at all. Finally, Arix rolled his eyes, giving up on him.\nIf the Brant family had 100 tricks, 99 of them were definitely with Varden. Trying to hide anything from him was more exhausting than the act itself. It was simply not worth it.\nSince Varden was his cousin, Arix decided it didn’t matter.\nBesides, if Draven didn’t get treatment soon, he might not make it. Nyx also realized this and picked him up, heading towards the legion hospital.\n\"Wait!\" Arix ran up and shouted.\nNyx stopped and looked at the two dirty kids with a blank expression. Then he coldly said, \"Move.\"\n\"I might have a way to save him. Do you want to try?\" Arix ignored Nyx’s bad attitude and spoke quickly.\nHearing this, Nyx was stunned, and even Varden wondered if Arix was crazy.\n\"This isn’t something you can joke on, you understand that? Don’t delay their treatment. Let them go,\" Varden said, grabbing Arix’s arm and trying to pull him away.\nNyx had a moment of hesitation but quickly dismissed it. Even the top Master Chemist of the Alliance admitted it couldn’t be done, so a kid was just talking big.\nNyx held his weakening lover and, without paying any more attention to them, continued walking.\nVarden held Arix back, and they watched Nyx get farther away.\nArix turned to Varden, worried. \"I really have a way. I can’t guarantee it will work, but I want to try.\"\n\"Are you sure? Nyx may get mad at you,\" Varden said, frowning and still not believing her.\n\"Do I look like I’m joking?\" Arix was so angry that she wanted to swear, but she held back.\nVarden saw that Arix didn’t look like she was joking at all. After thinking for a while, he made up his mind. \"Okay, let’s try.\"\n\"Yes!\" Arix nodded firmly.\nThey both ran to catch up with Nyx and stopped him again. But this time, Varden spoke, interrupting Nyx, who was about to get angry.\n\"Don’t get mad at us. Let me do the talking first. I am Sims’ grandson,\" Varden revealed his identity.\nNyx’s eyes showed a bit of interest. He finally looked up at Varden and, in a hoarse voice, said, \"And?\"\n\"My cousin, Arix, who is Admiral Kering’s granddaughter, says she has a way to save your lover. It might not work, but she wants to try.\" Varden laid it out clearly, not wanting to cause trouble for Arix.\nArix looked at Nyx nervously, waiting for his decision.\nHearing Varden’s words, even though Nyx felt dead inside, he was surprised to see these two young kids.\nThey looked so ordinary, yet one was a Master’s grandson, and the other was an Admiral’s granddaughter. But what did their identities matter? Being high-ranking wouldn’t save his lover.\nNyx wanted to refuse, but what came out was a single word, \"Okay.\"\nNyx found it funny after agreeing to the kids’ nonsense without thinking.\nHe wanted to refuse again, but couldn’t. He was desperate, willing to try anything. Any bit of hope was worth the gamble, even if it led to ruin.\nHe thought he might as well take a chance, even if it was a deep abyss. At worst, Draven would die, but proudly, as he died for honor.\nAfter reaching an agreement, Varden and Nyx looked at Arix. It was all up to her now.\nArix didn’t delay and started examining Draven right away. She checked his arteria carotis, lifted his eyelids, and pressed his belly.\nThe more she checked, the worse her expression became. Finally, she said seriously, \"We need a quiet place, preferably a private room.\"\n\"Let’s go to my dorm,\" Varden said and quickly led the way.\nNyx and Arix followed immediately. Varden’s dorm wasn’t far, and they reached there soon enough. Nyx carefully placed Draven on the bed and looked at Arix with pleading eyes.\nArix noticed Nyx’s look but didn’t have time to respond. She immediately contacted Vita in the psychic world.\n\"Vita, what should I do now?\" Arix asked anxiously.\nAfter a quick examination, she realized that Draven’s psychic world was shattered, and his brain condition was like late-stage cerebral infarction.\nIn this era, cerebral infarction wasn’t hard to treat, but it was a complication of his broken psychic world. If they didn’t fix the psychic world, the infarction would keep recurring.\nGiven how weak Draven’s body was at this moment, just a few recurring would take his life.\n\"Arix, don’t worry. Let me take a look inside,\" Vita comforted.\n\"Okay,\" Arix said. She placed her hand above Draven’s face. Vita transformed into psychic power and entered his brain, heading towards his psychic world.\nArix closed her eyes, and her vision switched to Vita’s perspective. She saw withered nerves and swollen blood vessels along the way.\nWhen Vita finally reached Draven’s psychic world, Arix saw only ruins. What should have been a mysterious, deep space like the universe now looked like a demolished site, leaving only rubble behind.\nThe shattered psychic world truly was a deadly condition in the interstellar era! Arix felt dizzy as she stared at the ruins. If she had to fix this alone, she wouldn’t even know where to start.\n\"Vita, is there anything I can help with?\" Arix asked, her voice now timid.\n\"It’s okay, Arix. Let me look around first. I’ll call you when I need you,\" Vita replied.\nThen Vita started circling around the broken psychic world, examining it thoroughly.\nWhile Vita was diligently inspecting, Arix’s mind wandered. She increasingly felt that the three psychic incarnations in her space weren’t just cute but actually very powerful beings. She could definitely rely on them.\n\"Arix, I found something,\" Vita suddenly said.\n\"Huh? Where?\" Arix looked around carefully but still saw only ruins.\n\"Here.\" Vita extended a psychic power tentacle and touched a glowing diamond-shaped crystal among the fragments.\n\"What is this?\" Arix also extended a psychic power tentacle, wrapped the crystal, and examined it closely.\nThen she exclaimed, \"Is this Draven’s consciousness?!\"\nConsciousness was the soul. And Draven’s soul, having lost its psychic world, was being continuously drained by the universe’s energy. From a once bright, shining bulb, his consciousness was now just a faint glow.\nArix couldn’t imagine if they had arrived any later, even if she saved Draven, he might have ended up in a vegetative state.\n\"Vita, what do we do now? He’s fading fast!\" Arix asked urgently, almost in tears.\n\"Arix, first wrap his consciousness in psychic power,\" Vita instructed with the calm authority of a senior, his steady tone helping to calm Arix down from her panic.\n\"Okay,\" Arix replied, her voice steadying.\nArix formed a transparent psychic power box around the diamond-shaped crystal. Once inside, the crystal stopped dimming. It might have been her imagination, but Arix felt the crystal seemed to be getting brighter. Perhaps Draven still wanted to live.\nArix thought of Nyx waiting anxiously outside and then looked at the struggling, glowing crystal in her hands.\nOne was outside, and one was inside, separated only by a physical body, but both were trying their hardest to see each other again.\nJust thinking about it, Arix could turn this situation into a tragic yaoi story.\nDraven and Nyx were suffering so much! If Arix’s psychic incarnation could cry, it would be flooding with tears right now.\nNo matter what, she was going to bring Draven back from the brink of death today. She was determined to be the matchmaker and make sure her favorite couple stayed together!",

      "content": "Chapter 69: Last Glimmer of Hope\nWith newfound determination, Arix asked Vita, \"What do we need to do next? Tell me. I’ll do anything!\"\nVita looked at Arix, suddenly so energetic, and shook his head indulgently. \"No, leave the rest to me. I’ll gather and repair the usable psychic fragments. It might take some time, so you should inform the people outside.\"\n\"How long will it take?\" Arix asked.\n\"About three days,\" Vita estimated.\n\"Alright... I guess,\" Arix said, her breath catching. It was a long time. She’d better go out and explain the situation.\nArix left Draven’s psychic world and opened her eyes.\n\"Miss Kering, can Draven be saved?\" Nyx asked anxiously.\nVarden didn’t speak but looked at Arix, waiting for her answer.\n\"He can be saved, but it will take some time,\" Arix said, glancing at Varden nervously.\nVarden was surprised that Draven could still be saved, but seeing Arix’s nervous expression, he had a bad feeling. It seemed like Arix might be causing trouble for him.\nTaking a deep breath, Varden asked, \"How long? Just give me a number.\"\n\"Three days,\" Arix replied, her eyes darting around nervously.\nVarden’s heart skipped a beat. He exclaimed, \"Arix! Do you think I’m a god? How can I hide the fact that someone is alive for three days?\"\n\"What can we do? Draven’s psychic world is too damaged. It takes that long to fix it,\" Arix said, feeling aggrieved.\n\"Miss Kering, don’t worry. I’ll guard you for these three days and let no one near unless they step over my dead body,\" Nyx said excitedly, not thinking twice now that Draven could be saved.\nFortunately, Varden didn’t argue with the temporarily irrational Nyx. Instead, he sighed and said, \"Arix, it’s impossible to hide this. I’ll inform Grandpa and see if he can help us.\"\n\"Okay! Varden, it’s all up to you. I’m going back in,\" Arix said, trusting Varden’s intelligence.\n\"Be careful,\" Varden reminded, his concern for his cousin evident.\n\"Okay,\" Arix said. She closed her eyes and returned her consciousness to Vita’s side.\nVarden looked at Arix and sighed. Then, he resignedly opened his opticomputer and sent a video request to Sims.\n\"Varden, what’s up?\" Sims answered quickly, but he looked tired and lacked his usual energy. He was probably still upset about not being able to help Draven earlier.\n\"Grandpa, I need to tell you something, but you have to promise not to get upset,\" Varden said, adjusting his glasses.\n\"Oh, go ahead. Today, even if you cause a big problem, I won’t get mad at you. I’m just too tired and don’t have the energy,\" Sims replied wearily.\nVarden’s eyes lit up, and he quickly said, \"Grandpa, you said it. If you don’t keep your promise...\"\nSims snorted and said irritably, \"What is it? Just tell me, okay? Why are you taking so long?\"\n\"I can’t say it over the opticomputer. Why don’t you come to my dormitory?\" Varden suggested.\n\"I’m not going. I already told you, I’m too tired and don’t have the energy. I don’t want to go anywhere today,\" Sims said with a hint of frustration. He felt useless for not being able to save someone despite his many years of medical experience.\n\"Grandpa, it’s not that I want you to come. It’s your precious little Moon Pie who’s in big trouble. If you don’t come, she’s done for,\" Varden said urgently.\n\"What the heck? What kind of scam is this? Did you burned the whole training base down or something?\" Sims scoffed, not believing him. He knew how strong Arix’s psychic power was, and nothing could happen to a powerful person like that.\nVarden was speechless. This was so typical—people always think he was lying when he was finally telling the truth.\n\"Master Sims, Varden isn’t lying. Miss Kering really needs your help,\" Nyx suddenly said, appearing on the 3D virtual screen.\nSims’ eyes widened, and he looked at Nyx in shock.\nHe rubbed his eyes and looked again.\nIt was Nyx’s face!\n\"Varden! What is going on? Explain it to me!\" Sims roared. Even with his slow reaction, he knew this was serious.\n\"I told you, I can’t explain it over the opticomputer. Just come quickly, Grandpa,\" Varden said, covering his ears.\n\"You better guarantee that my Arix is unharmed, or I’ll skin you alive!\" Sims threatened before hanging up and rushing to Varden’s dormitory.\nOn the other end, Varden rubbed his ears, which were ringing from Sims’ shouting. He looked at Nyx and said sarcastically, \"Arix and I have done so much for you.\"\nNyx didn’t understand what Varden meant, but his instincts told him to play it safe. So, Nyx gave Varden a sheepish smile.\nVarden hated dealing with people like this big guy. Often, his schemes would fail because of people like him.\nHe sighed inwardly and looked back at Arix, wondering how her treatment was going.\nIf Arix actually saved Draven, the whole Alliance and Empire would go crazy.\nFor centuries, psychic world and psychic power had been incurable.\nNow, someone was saying it could be treated. If it wasn’t Arix, Varden would think it was some clown making false claims. But seeing Draven slowly regain color, Varden had to accept that Arix might really be able to heal psychic world issues.\nSims arrived quickly. While Varden was still thinking, he felt a strong wind. Before he could react, someone smacked him hard on the head.\n\"Grandpa, be gentle! What if you make your smart grandson dumb?\" Varden didn’t need to look to know it was his grandfather.\n\"If making you dumb stops you from scheming all the time, I’d be grateful,\" Sims retorted.\nVarden was speechless.\nSims smirked at his speechless grandson and then turned to look at his granddaughter, who seemed to be treating someone. He was shocked to see that the patient was Draven!\nSims almost lost his breath. Once he recovered, he angrily said to Nyx, \"You know this is incurable. Why are you messing around with these kids?\"\n\"Master Sims, I have no other choice. Even if there’s a tiny hope, I want to try,\" Nyx said firmly.\n\"Ah... forget it. One’s poison is another’s honey. If you’re happy, do as you please,\" Sims sighed and stopped arguing.\n\"No, no, no, it’s not poison. Miss Kering said she could save Draven!\" Nyx hurried to explain, feeling that Sims had misunderstood.\n\"Captain, I understand your feelings, but even a child wouldn’t believe such claims,\" Sims said, not believing a word. He suspected Nyx was so heartbroken that he was hallucinating.\n\"Uh... well...\" Nyx was frustrated. He couldn’t convince Master Sims. No matter what he said, Sims thought he was acting out of grief.\nSeeing Sims’ expression of polite disbelief, Nyx felt that his words were useless. In desperation, he looked to Varden for help.",

      "content": "Chapter 70: Shocking The Admiral\nVarden looked at the two stubborn people in front of him and rubbed his forehead in frustration, thinking,\n’What did I do wrong to deserve this?’\nKnowing that he’ll need Sims’s help in his future studies, Varden had no choice but to say, \"Grandpa, Arix really can save this guy.\"\nSims could dismiss Nyx’s words as extreme grief, but hearing it from his own grandson made him hesitate.\n\"Are you sure? Think carefully. This is a fatal illness.\" Sims looked at Varden seriously.\nVarden nodded solemnly.\nSims knew his grandson well, so he believed him halfway. As for the other half, he would verify it himself.\nWith this in mind, Sims walked over to Arix and Draven.\nHe didn’t disturb them; he just observed closely.\nThe longer he watched, the more serious his expression became.\nFinally, Sims sent an urgent message to Matis.\nA moment later, Matis’s video call came through. Sims answered, and Matis’s concerned voice came from the other end.\n\"Sims, what’s happening? Why did you contact me so urgently?\" Matis asked.\n\"Come to Hecaris. I can’t explain everything in a video call,\" Sims replied, his face heavy.\n\"Okay! I’ll take a spacecraft and be there in an hour,\" Matis agreed without asking further questions and hung up.\nMatis was actually Varden’s maternal grandfather.\nVarden knew his grandfathers had been friends for decades, but he didn’t realize how close they were. Matis came over without asking any questions, while earlier, when Varden called Sims, he hesitated for a long time.\n\"Grandpa, look, you both are my grandpas, so why don’t you learn something from Grandpa Matis? He came right away without asking anything, but when I asked you earlier on, you wouldn’t agree at first,\" Varden muttered in annoyance.\nSims, old but with sharp hearing, replied with equal disdain, \"You and Arix are both my grandkids, but why is Arix prettier and more considerate than you? And she’s more talented in chemistry. Do you think maybe we switched babies at birth? Maybe Arix is my real granddaughter.\"\nVarden was at a loss for words, feeling his throat tighten as he tried to respond.\n...\nAn hour later, Matis arrived at the Fifth Legion. When Sims went to meet him, he explained the situation.\nMatis’s first reaction was disbelief. A broken psychic world was considered an incurable condition in the galaxy.\nIf Sims had said he would treat it himself, Matis might have believed it a bit. But when he heard Arix was the healer, he couldn’t believe it at all.\n\"I’m serious. Why don’t you believe me?\" Sims was exasperated, beginning to understand Nyx’s frustration.\n\"Sims, it’s not about belief. It’s impossible,\" Matis replied, having long lost hope for a cure for mental illnesses.\nEvery year, over 100,000 Alliance soldiers in the Fifth Legion died or were severely injured due to psychic problems. Matis had searched for a cure for decades without success. Now, however, someone claimed to cure psychic world issues, and Matis’s skepticism was understandable.\n\"You stubborn old man,\" Sims cursed in frustration.\nMatis advised, \"Sims, you should accept reality.\"\n\"To hell with reality,\" Sims snapped back, furious.\nThe two old men, with a combined age over a century, argued like children all the way to Varden’s dormitory.\n\"Ad... Admiral,\" Nyx stammered nervously, recognizing the Fifth Legion’s admiral.\n\"Grandpa,\" Varden greeted with a smile.\nMatis nodded in response to Nyx and then ruffled Varden’s hair affectionately. \"Varden, your look today is quite unique.\"\n\"No, it’s not a look. I’ll shower and change soon,\" Varden said, embarrassed and smiling.\n\"Sims, hurry up. What’s taking so long? This boy can wait for you love. You should focus on Kellan and Drexel,\" Sims scolded.\nVarden sighed.\nMatis shook his head and smiled at Sims. \"You haven’t changed a bit, still as hot-tempered as ever.\" He then comfortingly ruffled Varden’s hair again.\nSims, annoyed, said, \"Enough. You didn’t believe me? See for yourself.\"\nSims brought out a tester to check Draven’s condition.\nMatis, resigned, walked over to Draven and looked at the virtual screen of the tester.\nDraven’s condition was poor, both physically and psychically. The data on the screen showed low levels.\nBut as time passed, the levels began to rise slowly.\nWhen the psychic power level increased by one millimeter, Matis’s face turned serious and shocked.\nAs the levels continued to rise, tears welled up in Matis’s eyes.\nSims noticed and sighed. \"You two, go out for a while,\" he said to Varden and Nyx.\n\"But...\" Nyx started to protest, but Varden covered his mouth and dragged him out, locking the door behind them.\nWith only the four of them left in the room, Sims’s expression softened. He patted Matis’s shoulder, teasing, \"You’re so old, yet you cry in front of the youngsters. Isn’t it embarrassing?\"\n\"Sims, I’m just happy,\" Matis defended.\n\"Yeah, right,\" Sims said, rolling his eyes.\nMatis could see Sims was being dismissive, but he didn’t explain further and just hid his rare moment of vulnerability.\nHe then looked at Sims with determination and said, \"Sims, I know why you called me here, but we can’t keep this secret. The Alliance has many people who need Arix, and I believe Arix is willing to help.\"\n\"You! That’s your own granddaughter! If this gets out, she’ll be a target for all enemies, especially the insectoids. Matis, do you even have a heart?\" Sims angrily replied, clearly upset.\n\"Isn’t Arix already the primary target for the insectoids? Sims! Why is your Chemistry Department so busy, running around the clock? Others might not know, but you know exactly why!\" Matis said, his eyes filled with pain. Making this decision had been equally heart-wrenching for him.\n\"Matis, but Arix is still just a child,\" Sims said with a furrowed brow, his face showing his sadness.\n\"Sims, if the Alliance is a tree, the soldiers are the roots. They endure the insectoids’ bites to nourish the leaves. If the leaves abandon the roots, the roots will wither, and the tree will fall. Sims, do you think the leaves can survive then?\" Matis closed his eyes and fell silent.\n\"But at least...\" Sims began, only to be interrupted by a clear, young voice.\n\"OK, there’s no need to hide it. This is what I want to do,\" Arix said, having opened her eyes without them noticing. She looked at her two old men arguing over her and smiled.\nBoth old men fell silent. Finally, Matis smiled, a mix of bitterness and pride. \"Good, that’s my granddaughter. Don’t worry, Arix, if there’s any danger, Grandpa is ready to fight.\"\n\"And me, Arix. I am just a chemist, but I still have some influence,\" Sims added, unwilling to be outdone.\nThe two old men exchanged a glare, sparks flying between them.",

      "content": "Chapter 71: The Meeting\nArix laughed, causing her psychic power output to pause for a second. Vita was helping her, and she gently reminded Arix. Arix quickly focused again.\n\"Grandpa, I need to concentrate on the treatment now. Please inform the Alliance’s military research institute that I can help them develop a potion for treating psychic power. Set the time for three days from now,\" Arix said after a moment of thought.\n\"Leave it to me! You focus on your treatment,\" Matis promised with a nod.\nArix trusted her grandfather and then turned to Sims with a comforting smile. \"I know you care for me the most, but don’t blame Grandpa. This is something I’ve always wanted to do; it’s just happening a bit sooner.\"\nWith that, Arix closed her eyes again, fully focusing on repairing the fragments of Draven’s psychic world with Vita.\nOnce they started, they couldn’t stop.\nThe argument outside had been too intense for Arix to ignore, so she and Vita had found a way to pause briefly to say a few words. Now, she quickly returned to her task.\n\"What a wonderful child!\" Sims said, pulling out a small handkerchief as he cried, overwhelmed with emotion.\n\"She’s still my granddaughter,\" Matis said, trying to tease his old friend.\nSims put away the handkerchief and gave a cold laugh. \"My term ends next year. I’m quite tired of the Fifth Legion. I think I’ll return to the Third.\"\nMatis’s breath caught, and he struggled to keep his composure. Trembling, he said, \"It’s so noisy here, and I’m sorry what? What did you just say? Oh... I didn’t hear anything you said. I have a meeting to attend. Arix, I’ll leave you in Sims’ care. I must go now.\"\nWith that, Matis hurried away.\nSims watched Matis’s hasty retreat and coldly smiled, feeling victorious. \"Hmph, you think you can compete with me for Moon Pie’s love?\"\nLate at night, the five admirals had a rare reunion after many years.\nAdmiral of the First Legion: Mael.\nAdmiral of the Second Legion Admiral: Sykes.\nAdmiral of the Third Legion Admiral: Virek.\nAdmiral of the Fourth Legion Admiral: Fane.\nAdmiral of the Fifth Legion Admiral: Matis.\nThis emergency meeting, called by Matis, also included the president of the military research institute, Quillan, and the Alliance President, Zeta.\nDespite only having seven people, each was a pillar of the Alliance, the leaders of the interstellar realm.\nIn the meeting room, Zeta sat at the head of the table, with three people on each side.\nApart from Zeta, the others were middle-aged men over 50.\nQuillan wore a military uniform under a white lab coat. he had just rushed here from his lab, his hair still messy.\nThe five admirals wore olive-green uniforms, each with at least 5-8 highest honor medals on their chests.\nZeta, the youngest at around 30, wore a white presidential uniform. He looked at Matis and asked, \"Mr. Kering, what is so urgent that you called this meeting?\"\n\"And why is Quillan here? Does it involve him?\" Mael asked, puzzled.\n\"We just finished a battle with the insectoids, and now this emergency meeting?\" Sykes complained.\n\"I haven’t finished my experiment; I need to get back right after this,\" Quillan said, adjusting his glasses.\n\"Speaking of which, Matis, when will you return Master Sims to me?\" Virek asked with a smile.\nFane remained silent, his expression cold.\nIgnoring Virek, Matis cleared his throat and said solemnly, \"I gathered everyone here today to announce something very important.\"\nAt this, everyone fell silent and listened intently.\nMatis looked around at everyone, then dropped a bombshell, \"There’s hope for curing damaged psychic worlds now.\"\nMatis’s words caused the entire room to fall silent for a moment. Then, a burst of exclamations erupted.\n\"I’ll give you three seconds, and I want all the details on this!\" Quillan stood up, eyes shining as he looked at Matis, his voice filled with curiosity.\n\"Has Master Sims finally done it? We’re finally seeing hope before we die!\" Virek exclaimed excitedly.\n\"I think it must be our Psychic Ware masters who did it. Everyone knows only Psychic Ware can treat psychic power diseases,\" Fane said, dismissively.\n\"I don’t care it’s a Master Chemist or a Psychic Ware master. If they find a cure for that, I’ll salute them every time I meet them,\" Sykes said heartily.\n\"The nightmare of this era is finally ending,\" Mael said with relief.\n\"Mr. Kering, stop teasing us. Who is the master that discovered the cure?\" Zeta asked urgently.\nIt wasn’t unusual for the Alliance President and the admirals to lose their composure over matters.\nThe situation had plagued the Alliance and the Empire for centuries.\nIt was a fatal illness that current medicine couldn’t cure, affecting both civilians and soldiers.\nEvery year, the death toll was staggering, rivaling even that of insectoid attacks.\nAt least with insectoids, there was a chance to fight back. But with such severe psychic power disease, unless one could afford the expensive Psychic Ware, there was no hope.\nEven with Psychic Ware, it only delayed the inevitable. Those who couldn’t afford it were left to count down their remaining days in despair.\nMatis remained calm in the face of everyone’s excitement, a slight smile forming on his lips. \"I’m sorry to say, the person I’m referring to is neither Master Sims nor a Psychic Ware master.\"\n\"Then who is it? Matis, don’t make me come over there. I might be a civilized man, but you’re pushing it!\" Sykes cursed in frustration.\n\"Count me in if we’re hitting Matis. I’ve had enough of him. He’s been keeping Master Sims from returning to the Third Legion for three years now,\" Virek added angrily.\n\"Count me in, too.\"\n\"I’m in.\"\nSeeing the rising anger, Matis stopped teasing and cleared his throat. \"The person who can end this nightmare for the Alliance is my granddaughter, Arix Kering.\"\nThe room fell silent again.\nThis time, no one was angry or thought Matis was lying. They were unusually calm.\n\"If it’s Arix, it might be possible,\" Quillan mused, stroking his chin.\n\"A Supergiant+ psychic power combined with chemistry talents... even if it’s not possible now, it might be in the future,\" Virek said. He had a high regard for Arix, whose talent and potential were well-known.\n\"An impressive young person,\" Mael said approvingly.\n\"A well-behaved child, and she gets along well with my granddaughter. I often hear Cirilla mention her,\" Fane added, surprisingly not critical for this time.\n\"This girl is my ideal granddaughter-in-law. Too bad I don’t have a grandson. Maybe I could arrange a marriage with my grandchild,\" Sykes said thoughtfully.\nAs soon as he finished, Sykes deftly caught a pen Matis had thrown at him.\n\"I warn you, Sykes, don’t get any ideas about my granddaughter,\" Matis said angrily.\n\"One girl, many suitors. Especially such an outstanding one like Arix, you need to get used to it,\" Sykes replied, speaking in an exaggeratedly formal manner, which only added to Matis’s annoyance.\nEnraged, Matis’s psychic power formed into a fist, striking at Sykes. Behind him, a phantom of a powerful tiger appeared, growling coldly at Sykes.\nThe other admirals, watching the scene, quietly raised psychic power shields and continued to enjoy the show.\nVirek even thoughtfully added a shield for Quillan.\n\"Ahem,\" Zeta coughed, a serene dolphin appearing behind him. Then, a blue psychic power easily deflected Matis’s attack.\nZeta then stood up and bowed slightly to Matis. \"Mr. Kering, I apologize for my uncle’s words. Please forgive him.\"\n\"Hmph!\" Matis snorted. Then he decided not to embarrass Zeta and no longer argued with Sykes.\n\"What a pity. I was waiting for the show,\" Virek muttered quietly.\nZeta gave a helpless look at the old troublemaker Virek, then turned his stern gaze to Sykes. \"Uncle Sykes, please mind your words. Otherwise, I’ll have to talk to your wife about this.\"\n\"You ruthless kid. Fine, you win!\" Sykes fumed, pointing angrily at Zeta before reluctantly sitting down in silence.\nThe admirals exchanged glances and shared a knowing smile, as if saying, \"See, Sykes is just afraid of his wife. This tactic works, let’s use it to manage any troublesome subordinates.\"\nThey chuckled to themselves, thinking they’d learned a valuable lesson.",

      "content": "Chapter 72: Big Shots and Drama Queens\n\"Ahem,\" Zeta coughed again, interrupting the increasingly indecent exchange of glances.\nSykes was his uncle, after all. He couldn’t let him be too embarrassed.\nSo Zeta changed the subject and looked at Matis. \"Mr. Kering, do you have any proof for what you just said?\"\n\"Yes!\" Matis nodded confidently.\nThen he opened his opticomputer, enlarged the 3D virtual screen, and projected a video hologram above the long table.\nIn the hologram, it showed Arix saving people and the data from the testing equipment.\nThe air in the conference room quieted down instantly as the video played. Everyone watched the video carefully, afraid to miss any details.\nAfter the video ended, the seven people returned to their serious demeanor, no longer arguing but thinking deeply.\n\"Director Quillan, what do you think?\" Zeta asked the most professional person there.\nThe other five admirals also looked at Quillan.\n\"If we only look at this video, it seems that Arix’s psychic power is the reason she can heal the shattered psychic world,\" Quillan said after thinking for a while.\n\"Could it be because of her Supergiant+ psychic level? But the Empire’s prince is also a Supergiant+, yet he hasn’t been known to cure psychic power diseases,\" Virek said, raising an eyebrow.\n\"I think you forgot one thing. Since Arix’s psychic power is Supergiant+, maybe she also awakened her Psychic Incarnation?\" Fane, who dealt with psychic power every day, was the first to react and boldly guessed.\n\"Even if Arix has the Psychic Incarnation, so what? Besides Director Quillan, who here doesn’t have it? Just having the Psychic Incarnation doesn’t mean you can heal,\" Sykes interjected.\nQuillan, who had nothing, silently covered his chest, and glared at Sykes.\n’Thank you for pulling me into this. Really, thank you,’\nhe thought sarcastically.\nIf they kept talking, Arix’s secrets would soon be fully exposed. Knowing that, Matis finally couldn’t sit still. He quickly said, \"Before coming here, Arix told me to inform the Military Research Institute that she could help develop a psychic power healing potion. That’s why I brought Director Quillan today.\"\n\"A psychic power healing potion?!\" The big shots were shocked and exclaimed in unison.\n\"Are you sure?\" Quillan couldn’t sit still, looking at Matis with intense eyes.\n\"Yes, Arix did say it was a POTION!\" Matis emphasized the word \"potion\" to prevent these smart people from digging too much into his granddaughter’s secrets.\n\"Wow! That’s great! That’s just fantastic!\" Quillan didn’t care what Matis was thinking; he was simply overjoyed.\nThe Military Research Institute had been working tirelessly to solve the problem of psychic power diseases for hundreds of years. They almost worked around the clock, but until now, they had not found a solution.\nQuillan’s initial hope had turned into despair over the years. No one understood the bitterness in his heart.\nHe couldn’t wait any longer.\nQuillan felt he couldn’t sit still. He wanted to go to the Hecaris immediately and dive into researching the psychic power healing potion with Arix.\n\"Don’t get too excited yet,\" Matis said, trying to control the situation. \"Arix had two requests. First, she need three more days before she joins in the research. Second, the research should be done in the Hecaris. I’m sure everyone agrees to these small requests, right?\"\nMatis lied about the second request to keep the advantage for himself. Arix didn’t actually make that request, but Matis wasn’t going to let go of the benefit.\nIf the research took place in the Hecaris, the Fifth Legion would be the first to benefit from the potion once it was developed. Matis was determined to ensure this advantage.\nThe other four admirals exchanged glances. Although they wanted to object, they couldn’t deny the importance of the potion. Letting Matis’s people benefit first was acceptable, but they planned to negotiate the potion’s distribution later.\nThus began the session of sympathetic bargaining.\nMael started with a sorrowful expression, \"Everyone knows that my First Legion guards the most dangerous Unicorn Galaxy, just a few space stations away from the insectoid nest. We suffer the highest casualties every year. So, me asking for 20% of the potion isn’t too much, right?\"\nEveryone closed their eyes in thought, fingers on their chins, and then nodded.\nSykes wanted to garner sympathy too. He pinched his thigh but didn’t feel any pain, at least not strong enough to make him cry. Desperate, he imagined his wife left him for someone else.\nInstantly, tears streamed down his face as he said in a sorrowful voice, \"I know our Second Legion’s frontline isn’t the most dangerous, but the living conditions are the worst. The surrounding planets are covered in sand and trash. Our soldiers get excited seeing even a small piece of chocolate. They are fine soldiers of the Alliance but live worse than those picking garbage on Planet Waste. Can you bear not giving us more potion? Of course, I’ll only ask for 20%.\"\nEveryone was deeply moved, fingers on their chins, and nodded in agreement again.\nVirek quickly thought of a story and instantly acted like he aged ten years. Then, with a weary voice, he said, \"And my Third Legion is stationed at the farthest edge of Alliance territory. Because of the distance, husbands and wives often can’t reunite, and children don’t remember their fathers. The most important issue is that due to transportation difficulties, our soldiers often can’t get treatment in time. But I only ask for twenty percent of the potion. That’s not greedy, right? After all, we are so far away.\"\nEveryone felt his pain and nodded thoughtfully in agreement.\nChapter 77: Mysterious Ingredients\nMatis saw that everyone was about to divide the potion and quickly spoke before Fane could. \"Everyone knows the situation of the Fifth Legion, right? Not only is the potion Arix’s work, but with the recent insectoid tide, the Fifth Legion has been attacked the most. The hardships we face are immense. So, I must ask for thirty percent of the potion. If not, Arix might be too distracted to focus on the research, and if she fails to make it...\"\nBefore Matis could finish, everyone interrupted, \"Fine, fine, you can have it!\"\nMatis smiled discreetly, then said with a touched expression, \"Thank you, everyone, on behalf of the Fifth Legion.\"\nFane was left with only ten percent. Not happy, he said coldly, \"I’ll take fifteen percent for the Fourth Legion. So the Third Legion will give me 5% out of their 20%.\"\n\"Hey! Why pick on me?\" Virek glared.\nFane glanced at Virek and said calmly, \"Next year, I’ll give you an extra ten percent of Psychic Ware.\"\nVirek hesitated, wanting to refuse, but then he swallowed his words. With a righteous look, he declared, \"OK, for more Psychic Ware next year, I agree.\"\nThe others looked at Virek with disdain but were secretly envious. Trading 5% of potion for 10% of Psychic Ware was incredibly unfair, but unfair for the Psychic Ware side!\nThough Virek appeared bitter, he was thrilled inside. Potions might be rare for others, but not for the Brant family. They were a potion-making family with thousands of Master Chemists and tens of thousands of chemists. If they got the formula for the psychic healing potion, they could easily produce it themselves.\nWith this in mind, Virek felt even smarter.\nThus, the Alliance’s top-level meeting ended \"peacefully.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 73: The Guardian And The Demon\nAfter the meeting ended, the admirals of the five legions hurriedly left the conference room to start preparing for what was to come. Quillan, in particular, was eager to leave and took a team of top researchers from the Alliance Military Research Institute to the Fifth Legion on Hecaris.\nOvernight, the Fifth Legion’s base gained a heavily guarded research facility. There were guards every 25 meters and sentries every 100. Even their own people needed to give blood samples and undergo genetic testing to enter or leave the secure research institute.\nWhile the outside was busy, Arix was focused on discussing the Psychic Healer issue with Vita.\n\"Vita, are you sure this method will work?\" Arix asked, almost thinking she had misheard what Vita told her.\n\"Arix, it’s a bit gross, but this method can indeed treat most psychic power problems,\" Vita replied innocently.\n\"But saying that Cupid eats the Insectoid Core and then, um, expels it to treat psychic power issues seems too far-fetched,\" Arix said, still in disbelief.\nEarlier, Vita had suddenly told her about a solution to psychic power diseases while they were listening to Matis and Sims argue. Arix had been so happy she didn’t ask for details and even told the two old men about it when she left. Now that she knew the method, she found it hard to believe.\n\"It’s not far-fetched. The Insectoid Core is made of concentrated psychic power. In human terms, it’s like ’you are what you eat,’\" Vita explained while diligently mending some fragments.\n\"Then why hasn’t anyone in the Alliance figured this out? It seems too simple,\" Arix asked, puzzled.\n\"Because they don’t have Cupid,\" Vita pointed out the crucial factor.\n\"Cupid?\" Arix was even more confused.\n\"Yes, only Cupid can eat the Insectoid Core and then expel it, leaving some of Cupid’s beneficial psychic power in the Core. This Core can then be used as a medicine ingredient. Combined with a special treatment potion, it can cure different psychic power diseases. Plus, the psychic power from Cupid can be absorbed by the patient’s body, potentially even boosting their psychic power,\" Vita explained patiently.\nVita was Arix’s Psychic Incarnation and shared Arix’s knowledge of medicine. The only difference was that Arix wasn’t a Psychic Incarnation and didn’t know these things. If Arix had to discover this on her own, it would probably take a long time.\nUnless one day Cupid accidentally swallowed a Core and expelled it, Arix would never discover this by coincidence. But thankfully, with Vita’s presence, Arix could avoid decades of detours.\n\"I understand now. Thank you, Vita,\" Arix said, suddenly enlightened and a bit happy.\nArix knew very well how powerful Cupid’s psychic power was. For example, the violent psychic power in the Insectoid Core that everyone else avoided was just a snack for Cupid.\nVita called Cupid’s psychic power a medicine ingredient because it could possibly cleanse the patient’s psychic world of disease and hidden dangers. Therefore, Cupid’s psychic power was essential for making the psychic power treatment potion. Without Cupid, it would be impossible to create the psychic power treatment potion at all.\nAfter figuring out Cupid’s role, Arix, who didn’t need to mend fragments anymore, began studying how to combine medical ingredients to cure various psychic power diseases.\nFirst, for example, she remembered the potion that destroyed the Old Arix’s psychic world. Arix needed a core from Cupid, plus flame flowers and gravity-free grass to fix it.\nAfter creating a potion for one psychic disease, Arix started researching other psychic power diseases, such as:\n- Psychic power rampaging (attacked by a stronger psychic power)\n- Psychic power shrinkage (due to aging or other reasons)\n- Psychic power poisoning (from being poisoned)\n- Psychic power contamination (impurities infecting psychic power)\nHowever, while studying, Arix encountered a new problem. For diseases like a totally shattered psychic world, even the strongest potion seemed useless.\n’Will we always need Vita for such issues in the future?’\nArix thought for a long time but couldn’t come up with an answer. Finally, she looked at Vita for help and asked, \"Vita, can anyone else mend the fragments of the psychic world?\"\nVita thought for a while and nodded hesitantly, \"Yes.\"\n\"Really?\" Arix asked in surprise, \"How?\"\n\"Well...\" Vita seemed reluctant to speak, then extended a tentacle to cover his forehead and said in a resigned tone, \"After cleaning the impurities from the Insectoid Core, I eat it and then, um, release it. It will have my psychic power. Then the psychic power in the Insectoid Core can be used as a thread to mend the fragments.\"\nArix covered their mouth with a small tentacle after hearing this. No wonder Vita looked so reluctant before; it was really difficult for him to tell this hard truth.\nBut Vita and Cupid were truly amazing. One seemed like a guardian of life, the other like a demon of destruction. They were so impressive!\nThinking this, Arix suddenly became curious and asked, \"Vita, if Sophia ate the Insectoid Core and released it, would it also have a healing effect?\"\nVita laughed, \"Arix, only Sophia can’t do it. And don’t ask Sophia this question; she might hold a grudge and ignore you for a long time.\"\nArix scratched the back of their head with a tentacle and laughed awkwardly, \"Don’t worry, I won’t do that.\"\nIf Vita was a kind elder and Cupid was a cute little one, then Sophia was like the strict school principal. Even standing there silently, Sophia made Arix feel intimidated.\nArix gulped and shook their head, then focused again on researching psychic power healing potions.\nTime flew by.\nArix stayed in Draven’s psychic world for three whole days. During this time, apart from being given nutritious fluid and occasionally checking on Draven’s consciousness, Arix focused on researching the medical ingredients for psychic power healing potions. Now she had a lot of theories going on in her mind, and she only needed some final experiments to get accurate answers.\nArix felt it was almost time to leave. She looked at Vita’s progress and saw that Vita was also nearly finished.\nShortly after, Vita completed the last stitch, tied a knot, and then returned to Arix’s side, saying, \"Arix, you can release his consciousness now.\"\n\"Okay!\" Arix opened the psychic power box and released Draven’s consciousness.\nThe diamond-shaped crystal cautiously left Arix’s hand, and after confirming there was no danger, it started flying around the psychic world. Arix and Vita watched the excited and even mischievous diamond-shaped crystal with fond smiles.\nAfter exchanging a glance, Arix and Vita left Draven’s psychic world together.\nThe crystal paused, circled around where they disappeared, and then anxiously flew around the psychic world like a lost cub looking for its mother.\nIf Vita were still there, they would probably be holding their head in exasperation, as this clearly indicated that Draven either had amnesia or had gone a bit crazy, seemingly mistaking Arix for his mother.\nArix didn’t know yet that she was about to gain a \"big child.\" When she opened her eyes, she saw Nyx and an unfamiliar old man staring at her with an intense expression.\nSuppressing her urge to punch, Arix moved closer to Sims and observed quietly.\nSims saw his granddaughter scared and slapped Quillan on the back of the head, saying disdainfully, \"Calm down, you’re scaring Arix.\"\n\"Oh, sorry.\" Quillan didn’t get angry despite the slap. He immediately collected his fervent expression and became serious and dignified.\n\"Hello, Arix. Let me introduce myself. I am the director of the Alliance Military Research Institute. My surname is Quillan.\" Quillan smiled, now looking like a refined and handsome old man.\n\"Hello, Director Quillan,\" Arix said politely, shaking his hand.\nHowever, after shaking hands, Arix noticed that Director Quillan, who had just been normal for a little while, was once again looking at her with a fanatical gaze.\nArix was so confused.\nAt this moment, she distinctly heard the respectful image of a certain big shot in her mind shatter.\nArix had always thought of Quillan, the president of the Alliance Military Research Institute, as a cool and wise figure. But seeing this old man behaving like an overzealous fan, Arix felt like her idol had fallen from grace.",

      "content": "Chapter 74: Arix Becoming A Mother\n\"Draven, you woke up!\" Nyx, who had been watching Draven closely, noticed his fingers moving first.\nEveryone’s attention turned to Draven, even Quillan’s obsessive focus shifted to him.\nDraven was the first person to recover from a shattered psychic world. Quillan really wanted to study him.\nQuillan’s intense gaze scared Draven, who just woke up, and made him... cry.\nBut instead of hiding behind Nyx, Draven looked straight at Arix.\nHe ran over and hugged Arix’s arm, crying, \"Mom! There’s a weirdo.\"\nEveryone in the dormitory was shocked.\nArix, meeting everyone’s incredulous looks, quickly shook her hand and said, \"No, I’m not, he’s lying, I couldn’t have a son this big!\"\n\"Pfft!\" Sims, for the first time, didn’t help his Moon Pie. Instead, she laughed without any sympathy. He even said a little gleefully, \"I didn’t think I’d have another ’little Moon Pie’ so soon, hah!\"\n\"It seems the psychic world’s shattering affected him, maybe he has amnesia.\" Quillan said, rubbing his chin.\nNyx’s heart broke when he heard that. He had chased Draven for ten years before marrying him.\n’What if Draven also thinks I’m a weirdo? Will he not want me anymore?’\nWhile Nyx was lost in thought, Arix looked helplessly at the two old folks watching the show.\nSighing, Arix decided to solve the problem on her own.\nShe looked at Draven, who was clinging to her arm and timidly watching everyone.\nShe hadn’t even thought of what to say, but her mind was full of complaints.\nFirst of all, a grown man grabbing a young girl’s arm wasn’t appropriate.\n’And mistaking a stranger for his mom? That’s not just amnesia, that’s being dumb, right?’\nArix thought to herself, eyes rolling.\nAnd Nyx was so jealous of Arix right now that he was about to cry.\n\"Mom?\" Draven said innocently, blinking at Arix.\nArix’s mouth twitched, and she forced a twisted smile, \"Sir, I’m a fresh man in college, I can’t have a son your age, so can you let go of me?\"\nDraven’s subconscious was telling him it was impossible, but he felt a motherly vibe from this girl.\nFeeling more and more wronged, Draven’s tears started to flow even more, looking like a child abandoned by a cruel mother.\n\"What the heck!\" Arix was about to lose it and urgently called for Vita in the psychic world.\n\"Vita, come quickly! Draven seems to have gone dumb and insists I’m his mom!\" Arix said, on the verge of a breakdown.\nVita, seeing through Arix’s perspective in the psychic world, could only sympathetically say, \"His consciousness was drained by cosmic energy. He should recover in a while.\"\n\"Why does he think I’m his mom? Do I look like his mother, or do I have some motherly aura?\" Arix asked, exasperated.\n\"Hmm, it’s hard to say. Maybe because we used psychic power to save him and took care of him for three days, he felt a motherly warmth from you,\" Vita said, chuckling.\nArix was speechless.\nThankfully, Draven’s husband, Nyx, couldn’t stand it anymore.\nNyx walked over, knocked Draven out, and held him tightly, asking Arix awkwardly, \"Miss Kering, what’s wrong with Draven?\"\nArix, looking relieved, said, \"His consciousness is damaged. He’ll be fine after some rest.\"\n\"That’s good. I’ll take him away now. Goodbye, Miss Kering, Master Sims, Director Quillan,\" Nyx said, sighing in relief. Then Nyx quickly left with Draven, as if someone might try to take him away.\n\"Ha-ha!\"\nQuillan and Sims laughed again, teasing Arix about her awkward situation.\n\"Hey, are we still making the psychic healing potion? I might forget later,\" Arix said, glaring at the two old men and threatening through gritted teeth.\nTheir laughter stopped instantly, like being strangled.\nQuillan, reacting the most, hurriedly said, \"Yes, yes, let’s go, the lab is ready, we just need you.\"\n\"I’ll help too,\" Sims said, interested in the psychic power healing potion, and followed them to the Fifth Legion’s research institute.\nArix then spent her time in the research institute, working with top experts from the Alliance military research academy. They spent three days in heated debates and seven days frantically making potions.\nThe three days of arguments were about the potion formula Arix provided. Except for the Insectoid Core, which remained unchanged, everyone had different opinions on the proportions of the ingredients and the potion formula. No one would agree with the others.\nFinally, they decided to hold a competition. Quillan chose the formula with the best effectiveness and cost-efficiency, settling the matter.\nDuring the seven days of frantic potion-making, Arix didn’t participate directly. Instead, she focused on providing the chemists with ’Arix Crystal’ of Red and Green.\nThe Arix Crystal was extracted from the Insectoid Core by Cupid and Vita. After some experiments, the researchers discovered that only Arix could produce this core, so they named it after her.\nArix suggested adding \"Red\" and \"Green\" to differentiate between the two types of cores, so they wouldn’t both be called Arix Crystal.\nArix watched, lost in thought, as Vita and Cupid, nourished by an abundance of Insectoid Cores, transformed into little tigers. She silently marveled at the scene, feeling a bit distracted.\nA few days ago, Vita and the others suddenly turned into little tigers with wings.\nArix was really shocked.\nShe thought her Psychic Incarnations was just three pillars, but those pillars was actually like eggshells. Only until the other day, Vita and the others were truly born.\nArix covered her face with her hand. When she put it down, her eyes were shining like stars. Without saying a word, Arix summoned Sophia, who wasn’t working. Sure enough, what appeared in front of her was an adorable little tiger.\nThe little tiger had a pair of small wings and yellow fur with black stripes. The most noticeable thing was the ancient totem on her forehead, which made the chubby tiger head look graceful and mysterious.\nUnder the pair of half-round ears, her eyes, lined as if with gold eyeliner, were silver-grey. She was looking at Arix with extreme disdain.\n\"Ah, no matter how many times I look, she’s still too cute,\" Arix was lost in Sophia’s adorable appearance and didn’t care if the little one was annoyed. She just wanted to bury her face in Sophia’s fur.\nThat was an adorable idea, but reality was harsh.\nSophia pushed Arix’s face away with her front paws and warned her, \"Arix, if you keep doing weird things to me, I won’t teach you anything about mechas anymore.\"\n\"What?\"\nArix looked up, puzzled, and repeated, \"Mechas, you say?\"\n\"Yes, don’t you want to learn mecha the most?\" Sophia was relieved when Arix finally stopped.\n\"Sophia, you can build mecha?\" Arix asked, full of doubt.\nShe couldn’t believe it. There was no way Psychic Incarnation knew something she didn’t.\n\"I can’t now,\" Sophia said, as if it was obvious.\nArix was silent for a moment, then laughed.\nThe little one was too cute. Even boasting, Sophia did it in such a fresh and unique way without being annoying.\n\"Alright, alright, I won’t touch you,\" Arix said, fondly patting Sophia’s little forehead.\nEven though Arix got what she wanted, Sophia wasn’t happy. She felt like her abilities were being doubted.\n\"Hmph!\"\nSophia couldn’t be bothered to argue with her silly master and went back to the psychic world.\n\"Too bad,\" Arix sighed. Then she looked at the other two cuties with eager eyes.\nAll three little tigers looked exactly the same, except for the color of the totem on their foreheads.\nSophia’s totem was blue, Vita’s was green, and Cupid’s was red.\nArix’s heart melted as she looked at the adorable little tigers.\n\"Too bad Vita and Cupid are so busy,\" Arix said as she watched the two little ones, reluctantly shifting her gaze away.",

      "content": "Chapter 75: The Mecha Department\nVita and Cupid had indeed been working hard these past few days. Although eating Insectoid Cores wasn’t a tough task, it became challenging when the quantity was high. Their bellies were always full, especially Cupid’s, which made Arix feel a bit sorry for him.\n\"Cupid, why don’t you take a break?\" Arix walked over and gently patted Cupid’s head, worried about the little one who was noticeably rounder than Vita and Sophia.\n\"Hum?\" Cupid was lying on the table, leisurely gnawing on an Insectoid Core with his little paws. Hearing Arix’s words, he tilted his head in confusion and asked, \"Arix, are we running out of cores? I can eat less if needed.\"\n\"We have plenty of cores, but doesn’t it make you uncomfortable eating so much? Your belly looks really full,\" Arix said with concern.\n\"I don’t feel uncomfortable. The cores are delicious; I can keep eating. But, Arix, do you not like me getting fat?\" Cupid held his core, looking a bit melancholic.\nSeeing the conversation going nowhere, Vita chimed in, exasperated. \"Arix, Insectoid Cores don’t harm us. Cupid mainly consumes the aggressive psychic power within them. Even if he eats a lot, it’s fine. The excess energy turns into things like fat, making him temporarily chubby. Once it’s digested, he’ll slim down again,\" Vita explained expertly.\nArix finally felt reassured and showered Cupid with praise. \"Even if you get chubby, you’ll always be my little cutie, my precious.\"\n\"Okay, then I’ll eat more and get chubby as you like,\" Cupid said, smiling happily.\nKnowing that getting chubby wouldn’t make Arix dislike him, Cupid felt relieved and started eating the cores even faster. He had been holding back before, worried Arix wouldn’t like him if he got too fat. Now, he could eat freely.\nAfter a while, Cupid felt it was enough and went to the special box for storing Arix Crystals. He squatted like a cat and produced thousands of Arix Crystals. Then, he kicked the lid closed and went back to munching on Insectoid Cores.\nNow that Arix was reassured, she left Cupid and the others alone and opened her opticomputer to review her freshman mecha textbooks. The new school term was starting soon, so it was a good time to get familiar with the material.\nTime passed peacefully until a sudden knock on the door startled Arix. In an instant, the person and the two Psychic Incarnations in the room moved as if they had rehearsed it many times.\nCupid and Vita returned to Arix’s psychic world. Arix quickly went over to the cores and pretended to be refining Arix Crystals with psychic power. After making sure there were no flaws around her, Arix called out to the door, \"Come in!\"\nThe door to the lab finally opened, and a researcher responsible for collecting Arix Crystals walked in.\n\"Miss Kering, I’m here to collect the Arix Crystals,\" the researcher said politely.\n\"Alright, they are over there. There are about 300,000 today,\" Arix pointed to the corner of the room where a box full of Arix Crystals was kept.\n\"Thank you for your hard work, Miss Kering,\" the researcher said, looking at the box piled high in the corner. He bowed respectfully, feeling moved by Arix’s dedication.\nThe researcher imagined the immense effort it must take to refine so many crystals. He thought it would require endless hours of painstaking work.\nThe more he thought about it, the more emotional he became, even tearing up a little. Wiping away his tears, the researcher took a deep breath and mentally cheered himself on.\n’If someone as noble as Miss Kering works so hard, I should feel ashamed to slack off.’\nHe resolved that they, too, would stay up all night to work on psychic power healing potions.\nAs the researcher was leaving, he turned back and said to Arix, almost like he was making a vow, \"Miss Kering, your efforts will not be forgotten!!\"\nToday, he would go back and tell his colleagues about Miss Kering. He couldn’t just be the only one who noticed Miss Kering’s silent dedication. He wanted everyone to know how hardworking and kind Miss Kering was.\nArix looked completely puzzled at the researcher, who seemed like he had just been injected with a shot of adrenaline. She felt like he had cast some strange persona onto her.\nBut she didn’t think too much about it. After closing the door, she released Vita and Cupid from her psychic world.\nCupid and Vita immediately got excited and started gnawing on the cores. Arix, too, continued to eagerly read the mecha textbooks for her freshman year.\nTwo days passed like this, and Arix Crystal’s stockpile was temporarily sufficient.\nArix left the pharmacy room. She had initially wanted to help make some healing potions, but the researchers, one after another, insisted that she should rest, acting like she had been working hard for many days.\nTheir looks of admiration made Arix feel like she really had been working hard for many days.\nTaking out a small mirror, Arix looked at her own face, which was glowing with health. Then she looked at the researchers, who had heavy dark circles under their eyes.\nClearly, these researchers were the real hardworking ones.\nArix scratched her head, feeling a bit confused.\nShe then went straight to find Sims and expressed her intention to return to the training base.\n\"That’s good. If you don’t go back to training soon, the training will be over. But go back tomorrow. Tonight, you can use the opticomputer to check out the interstellarnet for some fun,\" Sims supported Arix’s plan to return to the training base. Remembering something, he asked her to stay one more night.\n\"Is there something happening on the interstellarnet tonight?\" Arix asked curiously.\n\"It’s a big deal. The Alliance officials are planning to announce the psychic power healing potion at 19:00 tonight. It would be a shame to miss it,\" Sims explained straightforwardly.\n\"It sounds like it’ll be exciting. I’ll go back tomorrow then. Grandpa, I’m going to have some fun now,\" Arix said goodbye to Sims, planning to visit the Mecha Department before heading back.\n\"Go ahead,\" Sims said, affectionately ruffling Arix’s hair and smiling.\nLuckily, he didn’t know where Arix was going, or else her head would probably get ruffled even more.\nAfter leaving the research institute, Arix headed straight to the Mecha Department.\nAs soon as she arrived at the entrance of the Mecha Department, two soldiers stopped her.\nArix showed the one-time pass Kellan had given her on her opticomputer, and then she was allowed into the Mecha Department.\nBefore coming, Arix had always thought the Mecha Department would be especially chaotic, and that the air would be filled with the smell of industrial heavy metals.\nBut once inside, she found the Mecha Department surprisingly clean and tidy. Everything was orderly and well-organized.\nAt the entrance hall of the Mecha Department building, there were many display cabinets. Each shelf had a transparent energy shield, and inside most of them, there was a Space Button.\nArix guessed that each Space Button must contain a mecha because each slot had a label in front of it. The labels listed the mecha’s name and its owner’s name, along with their rank and unit.\nThere were also helpful signs on the cabinets indicating whether the mecha was \"repaired\" or \"unrepaired.\"\nAt that moment, many Alliance soldiers were in the hall, happily following the numbers on their opticomputers to find their mecha in the cabinets marked as \"repaired.\"\nOnce they found their mecha, they just needed to press a button in front of the transparent energy shield. After the system verified their identity, they could retrieve their Space Button.\nAs soon as the soldiers got their Space Buttons, they left the hall immediately, heading outside the Mecha Department.\nUnfortunately, since the mecha were inside their Space Buttons, Arix couldn’t see them, no matter how much she wanted to.\nWith a sigh of regret, Arix decided to head to the repair department, hoping to get a glimpse of some mecha being repaired.\nShe wandered to the entrance of a repair room and stopped. She peeked inside quietly.\nIn the spacious and tall repair room, there was a damaged mecha in the middle. A mecha repair technician and two assistants were working on it.\nAfter watching for a while, Arix finally understood why everything stayed so clean.\nThe mecha repair technicians kept their tools and parts in Space Buttons, taking them out only when needed.\nArix watched intently for a while, her eyes sparkling with excitement, when suddenly a voice behind her made her jump.\n\"Who are you? What are you doing here?\" a stern voice demanded.\nArix turned around to see an old man holding a vacuum, glaring at her suspiciously!\nHis fierce eyes seemed to say that if she didn’t give a good reason, he would call security.\nArix quickly made a \"shh\" gesture, walked up to him, and showed him the pass Kellan had given her.\nShe explained, \"Sir, hello. I’m a student from the training base. I came to visit the Mecha Department for a day.\"\nThe man, Magen, carefully verified the pass. His expression relaxed, but he still looked at Arix with slight disdain.\n\"If you’re here to visit, just visit. Why are you sneaking around like a thief? If it were someone else, I’d have called security right away.\"\n\"Mm-hmm, thank you, sir. I didn’t want to disturb the masters, so I thought I’d just take a quick look,\" Arix said, scratching her head, feeling a bit embarrassed.\nPerhaps the love for mechas in Arix’s eyes touched Magen. His stern expression gradually softened as he said, \"You’re a silly kid. Come on, I’ll take you to a repair room to have a look.\"\n\"Really?! Thank you, sir! But... will it bother anyone?\" Arix asked, her excitement giving way to a bit of hesitation.\n\"No worries, that repair room is empty, and there’s a Comet-Class mecha in there waiting to be fixed. You can take a close look at it,\" Magen said generously.\n\"Wow!! That’s awesome! Thank you, sir!\" Arix exclaimed in delight.\n\"Alright, follow me,\" Magen said, smiling warmly at Arix’s politeness. He nodded and led the way.\nArix, brimming with excitement, happily followed behind him.",

      "content": "Chapter 76: Errand Girl\nBefore long, Magen brought Arix to a repair room that was clearly larger than the previous one.\nStopping at the entrance, Arix curiously looked inside and saw a 6-meter-tall dark blue mecha in the center of the room. The mecha’s paint was almost completely peeled off, and its body was in terrible condition.\nJust one look made Arix think that this mecha was one step away from being scrapped.\nHowever, even though it looked like junk, it was still a precious treasure for the army.\nArix thought about how she would soon get to work on the mecha up close, and her excitement made her fingers tremble slightly.\nMagen noticed Arix’s excitement and raised an eyebrow. \"I haven’t asked yet, what’s your major? Are you from the Department of Mecha Manufacture?\"\nArix nodded vigorously. \"Yes.\"\n\"Good. I’ll leave this mecha to you. Make sure to clean it thoroughly. Remove the damaged parts and, if you can, try to replace them. There are new parts in this Space Button. I’ll leave it to you. I have other things to do.\" Magen said, tossing a Space Button to Arix before walking away casually.\nArix stood there, thinking,\n’Why do I feel like I’ve been brought here to go on errands?’\nBut such kind of errands was just what she needed. She wouldn’t mind doing it even if there were more.\nMeanwhile, Magen ran into a mecha technician coming out of another repair room.\nSurprisingly, Magen, who looked like a janitor, did not eagerly greet the technician. Instead, the technician placed his right hand over his chest and gave a respectful salute. Magen nodded in return.\n\"Director, is there something wrong with the cleaning again?\" the mecha technician guessed, seeing Magen holding a vacuum.\n\"I’m about to talk to the head of cleaning. They keep adding strange functions to the cleaning robots. I want them to clean, not go out and fight insectoids!\" Magen said, gritting his teeth with anger.\nMagen wasn’t some neat freak, he just couldn’t stand seeing dirty or messy places.\nThe mecha technician almost laughed but held it in. Pretending to agree seriously, he said, \"Right, who thought it was a good idea to put missiles on cleaning robots?\"\n\"Exactly! Don’t they have anything else to do? I’ll give them more work to do, and they’ll lose their monthly break.\" Magen said fiercely.\n\"Why not dock their pay?\" the mecha technician asked curiously.\nMagen rolled his eyes. \"With the salaries we get in the Mecha Department, it’s barely enough to live on. Docking pay would be too cruel.\"\nThe technician nodded in silence.\n\"Alright, alright, I’m off. Oh, by the way, about Bernanke’s repair room. He’s off today, right? When he comes in tomorrow, let him know I found him an assistant, but he should also double-check the mecha himself,\" Magen quickly added, almost forgetting.\n’An assistant?’\nThe mecha technician didn’t quite understand what the director meant but decided not to think too deeply about it. He nodded and said, \"Alright, sir.\"\n\"Good,\" Magen replied, then headed off to find the head of cleaning.\nIn the repair room, Arix stood in front of the battered mecha, carefully examining the various terrifying scars on its body for a long time. Despite its severe damage, the mecha still gave off a cold, powerful, and reassuring feeling.\nArix stared at it with fascination, placing her hand on the mecha’s body, as if she could feel the brutal battles it had endured before being brought here.\nAfter a moment of excitement, Arix finally tore her eyes away from the mecha.\nShe spoke softly to the mecha, regardless of whether it could hear her, \"I will fix you up well. I guarantee you’ll return to the battlefield, strong and brave!\"\nWith that, Arix rolled up her sleeves, grabbed a cloth and a bucket. She decided to start by cleaning the mecha’s dirt and grime.\nBefore beginning, Arix released Cupid and the others from her Space Button. She then instructed the three little ones, \"I’m going to start working. You guys can hang out, but remember not to leave the room.\"\n\"Okay, Arix. Are you going to clean this big guy? We can help you,\" Cupid asked sweetly.\n\"No need, I can do it. Cupid, if you’re bored, you can keep gnawing on the Insectoid Cores,\" Arix said, handing her Space Button to Cupid.\n\"Yay!\" Cupid nodded excitedly.\nCarefully holding the Space Button in its mouth, Cupid hopped onto a nearby table and happily started eating the cores.\n\"Arix, let me help you. It’ll be too slow with just one person,\" Vita insisted.\nSeeing Vita’s determined expression, Arix didn’t argue and instead responded fondly, \"Thank you, Vita.\"\nAs for Sophia, she didn’t return to the psychic world this time but also didn’t seem interested in helping with the cleaning. She had climbed onto the mecha and was walking around, occasionally stopping to use her psychic powers to probe something.\nArix assumed she was just having fun and didn’t say anything. After wetting and wringing out two cloths, she handed one to Vita.\nVita firmly gripped the cloth with her furry paws. Then she jumped onto the mecha and began diligently cleaning the dirt.\nWatching Vita adorably cleaning, Arix felt her heart melt. She secretly opened her opticomputer and took several photos before finally smiling in satisfaction.\nClosing her opticomputer, Arix then focused seriously on cleaning the mecha’s dirt and grime.\nThe mechas were such complex technology, yet the way to clean them was surprisingly raw. Arix, after a busy morning, started to dismantle the damaged parts inside the mecha.\nAfter spending an hour taking it apart, Arix heard Sophia’s calm and steady voice.\n\"The converter is broken too,\" Sophia said.\nArix looked at Sophia in surprise. Then, without questioning, Arix went to the center of the mecha on the lift.\nOpening the outer layer of the mecha, Arix took out the converter. Then Arix used psychic power to scan inside carefully.\nArix saw a small wire was broken inside the converter. Although it was a minor issue, it could make the mecha’s movements less smooth.\n\"Sophia, you’re amazing!\" Arix confirmed, giving Sophia a thumbs up.\n\"Hmph!\" Sophia lifted her head proudly, pretending not to care, but her little tail wagged happily behind her.\n\"The driver is old, though not broken. I suggest replacing it,\" Sophia said.\n\"Alright, take it out,\" Arix agreed immediately.\nThen, Sophia pointed out a few more hidden places, and Arix took them apart one by one.\nWhen Sophia finally stopped talking, Arix breathed a sigh of relief. She hadn’t realized she missed so many places.\nIf Arix scored 90, Sophia added 10 more points.\nThat was impressive.\nNow Arix started to take Sophia’s words seriously. Sophia might not be able to build a mecha, but her understanding of them was no less than Arix’s.\nArix mainly relied on Old Arix’s memories and her own recent studies about mechas.\nBut now it seemed Sophia, who had never actually worked with mechas, was better.\nIt was like Sophia had a natural talent for mechas.\nArix looked at Sophia with increasing excitement, scheming in her mind.\nSophia felt a chill for no reason. Then she noticed Arix watching her. Sophia nervously swallowed and asked, \"Why are you looking at me?\"\nArix quickly changed her eager expression to a harmless smile. \"I just think you’re really amazing, Sophia. There are so many things I don’t understand. Would you mind teach me?\"\nArix put on a scared-to-be-rejected face, looking at Sophia with a pitiful expression. She even blinked her eyes, like a teenager’s rough attempt to hit on a guy in a bar.\nSophia rolled her eyes and cringed a bit. Unable to bear it, she quickly said, \"I’ll teach you, just act normal, or I’ll puke.\"\nWith that, Sophia gagged a bit.\nArix secretly rolled her eyes and huffed, silently accusing Sophia for not recognizing her charm.\nDespite her thoughts, Arix showed a deeply moved expression and sweetly added, \"Sophia, you’re the best! I like you the most, mwah...\"\n\"If you keep talking, I won’t teach you anymore!\" Sophia said fiercely, but her tail was wagging like a happy fan, and even her fluffy face had a shy blush.\nArix raised her eyebrows, understanding but not commenting on it, and obediently replied, \"Okay, I won’t say anymore.\"\n\"Hmph!\" Sophia snorted coldly.\nThen she started carefully guiding Arix on installing the new components on the mecha. For some parts that were missing, Arix even got them from her Space Button and installed them.\nThey worked busily the whole afternoon. When the last part was in place, Arix applied a layer of anti-radiation paint to the mecha. Only then was the repair officially finished.",

      "content": "Chapter 77: Kidnapping\nAfter cleaning up everything, Arix and the three little tiger cubs stood in a line in front of the mecha, their four pairs of eyes simultaneously looking at the newly repaired mecha. They all exclaimed in awe.\n\"Wow! This big guy is so cool!\" Cupid exclaimed excitedly.\n\"It’s just okay,\" Sophia said with a disdainful look, but her eyes showed a hint of satisfaction.\n\"Arix and Sophia are amazing. You both did a great job!\" Vita praised.\nArix and Sophia blushed a little at the compliment, their smiles growing wide.\nAfter a moment, Arix suggested, \"Let’s take a few pictures together. It’s our first repaired mecha, and it would be a shame not to capture this moment.\"\n\"Yes! Happy, happy!\" Cupid was the first to agree, excitedly circling the three of them.\nSophia, for once, didn’t say anything sarcastic and nodded.\n\"I’ll choose the angles. Arix, give me your opticomputer,\" Vita said indulgently, looking at the three of them. He took the opticomputer from Arix and used his psychic power to make it float in the air.\nFollowing Vita’s directions, Arix stood a bit away from the mecha in the middle, holding Vita, Sophia, and Cupid in her arms. They all smiled for the picture.\nThey took photos in various spots: on the mecha’s shoulder, in its palm, in the crook of its arm, and finally inside the mecha’s control cabin, finishing with one last group photo.\nArix took back the opticomputer and opened the gallery, happily looking through the photos with the three little ones.\n\"Cupid, don’t move around so much next time. You made this photo blurry,\" Sophia complained when she saw a slightly blurred Cupid in one picture.\n\"Got it. I won’t move next time,\" Cupid replied, looking a bit sad.\n\"It’s okay, it’s just one photo. The others are great,\" Vita said, lifting his paw to rub Cupid’s little head.\nArix didn’t say anything, just patted Cupid’s head to show comfort.\nArix wouldn’t get involved in the little ones’ affairs. After all, each of them was her precious cub. She loved them all equally and couldn’t bear to favor one over the other.\nFortunately, Vita had the nature of an elder, and he could help Arix take care of Cupid and Sophia. Without Vita, just thinking about handling these sweet troubles made Arix feel overwhelmed.\n’Ah! Love Vita!’\nArix thought, feeling grateful.\nAfter looking at the photos, Arix was ready to leave. She sent Vita and the others back to her psychic world to rest. Alone, Arix walked out of the repair room and closed the door behind her.\nShe wanted to thank the old man again but couldn’t find him anywhere.\nNot long after she stepped out of the gate of the department, a man and a woman grabbed her. One of them covered her mouth, and the other wrapped his arms around her waist and carried her away.\nSuddenly kidnapped, Arix was confused and didn’t react at first. Once she calmed down a bit, she saw that the people who kidnapped her were Cantet and Rhea. A bad feeling rose in Arix’s heart.\n’Are they here for revenge? Should I resist when they start beating her?’\nThe kidnapping process was very short. In less than 30 seconds, Cantet and Rhea brought Arix to a secluded corner.\n\"What do you want?\" Arix asked, looking at them warily. She also prepared Cupid in her psychic world for a fight.\nCantet and Rhea exchanged a glance. Then, they were about to take something out of the Space Button.\nArix grew more and more nervous, thinking they might take out guns or clubs to beat her. The tension was high.\nJust as Cupid was about to come out, Arix saw two hands holding gifts appear in front of her.\n’Gifts?’\nBoth Cupid and Arix were stunned.\nArix looked cautiously at Cantet and Rhea. Cantet was the one she had accidentally hurt, and Rhea was the one she had fought. Both of them ended in the hospital because of her.\nArix checked their faces again. Yes, it was definitely them.\nSo, they couldn’t possibly be here to give her gifts. They were more likely here to finish her off.\n’Damn it, it’s a trap! Run!’\nJust as Arix was about to turn and run, Cantet and Rhea grabbed her shoulders from both sides.\nArix closed her eyes in resignation. Then she turned to them and said, \"What do you want? I won’t resist, okay? Just do what you want quickly. Have some mercy and don’t give me sufferings.\"\nCantet and Rhea looked at Arix in confusion. Rhea frowned and asked, \"I think there are some misunderstandings here. We came to apologize.\"\n\"Apologize?\" Arix almost looked at them with horror, wondering if they were crazy.\n’Am I dreaming, or are these two crazy, or the world has just gone crazy as I expected?’\nShe had both of them end up in the hospital, and they came to apologize to her.\nNo matter how shocked Arix felt inside, she kept a calm expression, quietly watching them.\nPerhaps the awkward silence made Cantet and Rhea feel uneasy. The latter coughed and decided to speak quickly.\n\"I shouldn’t have brought my own selfish motives and invaded your psychic world. Even though your psychic power retaliated against me, I still need to say, I’m sorry.\"\nArix’s expression changed. She asked silently in her mind, \"Vita, is he telling the truth?\"\n\"Yes, he tried to hypnotize you to get information, so I had Cupid teach him a lesson,\" Vita, usually kind-hearted, held a grudge this time.\nArix was shocked to realize she had narrowly avoided a great danger.\nShe wasn’t even from this interstellar world. If Cantet had discovered her true identity, her fate would have been grim.\nShe had thought Cantet’s psychic power backlash was because she forgot to mention her psychic power level. It turned out that he was actually trying to invade her psychic world.\nInfuriating, she said to Vita, \"Next time we meet someone like this, make sure they stay in hospital for at least six months!\"\n\"Got it!\" Vita, sharing the anger, clenched her tiny fists.\nHaving understood the reason, Arix showed no kindness to Cantet but still accepted the gift. She then gave a sarcastic, sweet smile. \"Captain Cantet, do you want to try again next time? The consequence isn’t severe; just another six month in the hospital.\"\nCantet shivered and hid behind his sister, Rhea. He had had enough of hospital food.\nSeeing Cantet scared enough to hide behind Rhea calmed Arix’s anger a bit. She turned her attention to Rhea, thinking what kind of apology she was going to offer.\nRhea, trying to maintain her cool demeanor, nearly lost it under Arix’s gaze. She awkwardly coughed and said, \"Um, Cantet is actually my brother. I thought you were hurting him on purpose, so I was harsh during the assessment. Sorry, here’s my gift. Please forgive me.\"\nArix was speechless.\nThis truth was worse than not knowing. At least then, she wouldn’t feel so frustrated. The guilty was eating away from her, and she almost lost her dinner appetite. Now, she felt like something was stuck in her throat, making it impossible to swallow her anger.\nHowever, Arix naturally had a soft spot for girls like herself. She sighed helplessly and took Rhea’s gift. Then she stared at the two and said, \"Apologies accepted, but I have one finally request.\"\n\"Say it, we’ll definitely do it!\" Cantet and Rhea looked at Arix with determined eyes, eager to show their sincerity.\nArix originally wanted to say, \"Just stay away from me in the future.\" But seeing their eager faces, she couldn’t bring herself to say it. Finally, she sighed and rubbed her forehead.\n\"You two are my brother’s comrades. Just take care of him should anything happens,\" she said.\n\"No problem, that’s easy. Leave it to us,\" Rhea quickly agreed, her voice full of enthusiasm.\nCantet, however, hesitated. In the end, he nodded silently, as if bearing a great burden. Taking care of his ’nemesis’ was a bitter pill to swallow. Just thinking about having to be nice to Kellan made him shudder.\nBut Arix didn’t know any of this. She genuinely believed that Cantet was a good friend of her brother. After all, Kellan had brought soup to Cantet when he was in the hospital. And Cantet had claimed to be friends with her brother.",

      "content": "Chapter 78: A Spy\nIt was getting late.\nArix checked the time on the opticomputer. It was almost 6 PM. Thinking about catching the excitement on the interstellarnet later, Arix said goodbye to Cantet and his sister.\nBack at her temporary residence, Arix released Cupid and the others from her psychic world. Arix took a shower first. Then she lay back on the bed with the three little ones, watching the holographic live stream projected by the opticomputer.\nAt this moment, the Alliance’s official live stream was on, but it hadn’t started yet. In the live stream room, besides the background wall with the Alliance’s national emblem, there was only a simple wooden table with five potions of various colors on it. There were no introductions around the potions.\nThe audience in the live stream could only guess. Then they posted all kinds of strange ideas on the public screen.\nSnooLover42: \"I suspect these are gene upgrade potions. They’ve been researching this for decades, so it’s about time.\"\nCosmicWanderer: \"Even if the gene upgrade potion is out, I wouldn’t use it. Novelists have written about meddling with human genes, causing people to develop mental disorders as adults. Natural babies are the best.\"\nMemeMachine3000: \"You’ve read too many novels. Why not say the potion will turn you into a zombie immediately?\"\nEightBalls: \"Exactly. This is an official account. They wouldn’t dare to show the potions if they weren’t safe.\"\n...\nArix watched the heated discussion on the public screen and posted a message.\nMechaMonster: \"Could it be a Psychic Healer?\"\nAs soon as Arix said this, the public screen went silent for a moment. Then it exploded with messages.\nDeepSpaceNineFan: \"I didn’t want to join the conversation, but you guys are getting too ridiculous. A Psychic Healer? Everyone knows terminal psychic power diseases can’t be cured, at least not by potions.\"\nSnooLover42: \"MechaMonster, I thought I had a wild imagination, but you beat me. Respect.\"\nMemeMachine3000: \"Even my grandfather, who’s close to passing away, asked if a Psychic Healer was available today.\"\nCosmicWanderer: \"It’s never coming out. If it does, I’ll pee standing on my head.\"\nMechaMonster: \"I took a screenshot. Keep your word.\"\nCosmicWanderer: \"The Alliance can never make it!!\"\nArix raised an eyebrow, feeling something was off, and sent another message.\nMechaMonster: \"Galactic beans ground fine and fair—\"\nThis sentence was from a well-known Alliance advertisement. Almost every citizen could finish it with, \"A cosmic espresso fills the air.\"\nAnyone who couldn’t complete the sentence would have a very suspicious identity.\nCosmicWanderer: \"What beans? Are you saying the potion bottles have beans?\"\nThe chat went silent again for a moment. Then the viewers in the live stream became even more excited.\nSnooLover42: \"Caught a little spy. I’ve already notified the police. You’re welcome.\"\nhail_our_Alliance: \"Can’t even finish our Alliance’s slogan. Definitely a spy.\"\nOlivetree: \"So quiet for so long. Feeling guilty?\"\n...\nMeanwhile, the top hacker spy, known as CosmicWanderer, who had been lurking in the Alliance for a long time, was arrested by the police on charges of espionage.\nHe still couldn’t accept the fact that he had been exposed as he struggled and denied, \"You’ve got the wrong person! I’m not a spy!\"\nThe police officer sneered, \"Galactic beans ground fine and fair—\"\n\"What...?\" CosmicWanderer was utterly confused.\n\"You don’t even know this? And you dare claim you’re from the Alliance? Reflect on this in prison.\" Seeing the criminal unable to respond, the interstellar police officer spoke coldly, more convinced of his guilt.\n\"You have no evidence. Why are you arresting me? I’ll sue you,\" CosmicWanderer glared at the police officer, threateningly.\n\"Huh! Do you think we’d arrest you without evidence?\" The interstellar police officer laughed mockingly.\nHe then opened the opticomputer and displayed photos of the secret documents that CosmicWanderer had transmitted outside the Alliance.\nCosmicWanderer’s eyes trembled as he looked at the evidence. Finally, he lowered his head, silent, allowing the police to take him away.\nBack in the live stream room, after the spy was arrested, the police posted an official announcement.\nCosmicWanderer was a spy, and he had been arrested and put in custody.\nThis news left Arix stunned. She had only felt a bit suspicious, never expecting to accidentally catch a real spy.\nAt that moment, Arix’s feelings matched her comment on the screen.\nMechaMonster: \"....\"\nSnooLover42: \"Amazing, we really caught a spy.\"\nfriedinsectoid: \"For some reason, I feel sorry for him\nhail_our_Alliance: \"You sympathize with the spy? I think I have reason to doubt you now. So please complete my sentence: Galactic beans ground fine and fair—?\"\nfriedinsectoid: \"A cosmic espresso fills the air.\"\nhail_our_Alliance: \"Suspicion canceled, confirmed you’re an ally!\"\n...\nArix watched the live stream’s sudden spy-hunting craze, feeling a bit awkward. She seemed to have set the stream’s tone off course.\nFortunately, it was finally 7 PM. In the live stream, two people in white lab coats and five patients in hospital gowns appeared.\nArix recognized the two in white lab coats; they were from the Fifth Legion research base. The older one was called Noland, and the younger one was Hinddle.\n\"Hello everyone, welcome to the official channel of the Alliance. Today, I bring you great news: the Psychic Healer has finally been successfully developed!!\" Noland said excitedly, looking directly at the live stream camera.\nThe live stream audience went wild, expressing disbelief, but since it was an official broadcast, the public chat fell silent.\nSome viewers, once they processed the news, immediately rushed to call their family and friends to watch the live stream together. Others started sobbing uncontrollably, crying for themselves and for their friends and family.\nThere were also spies from other countries among the viewers, who, upon hearing the news, real or not, immediately reported it back to their own countries.\nThe entire Alliance—no, the entire galaxy... All the countries, large and small, now focused all their attention on the Alliance. They were eager to see how the Alliance had addressed the difficult that had been haunting this world for thousands of years.",

Then he stopped keeping everyone in suspense. He looked at the livestream camera with bright eyes, and said, \"I believe everyone is as excited as I am, so I won’t waste any more time. Let me introduce these five potions.\"\nNoland picked up the first potion and displayed it in a hologram in the livestream. While showing it, he said, \"The first potion is for treating psychic power poisoning. To show the effect of the potion, we invited five patients with mental illnesses today. The first one is a patient with psychic power poisoning. This is the patient’s medical report. Everyone can click to view it.\"\nAfter Noland finished speaking, a medical report appeared in the livestream. Arix, curious, also clicked to take a look.\nMilitary Research Institute Medical Report\nPatient Name: Dan Kruse\nTitle: Ensign, the Fifth Legion\nExamination Results\nBody: Fractured lower leg has healed, heart and lungs replaced with cloned organs. Long-term rest recommended.\nBrain: Due to complications, brain nerves and blood vessels are withered and ruptured.\nPsychic Power Examination: Due to insect bio-poison, psychic power is exhausted and polluted, with a possible future rampage. Treatment is advised, and it should be done as soon as possible.\nBefore the livestream, this medical report would have been a death sentence. But now, there is hope for a cure. And it’s officially certified. Thinking of this, the viewers became more and more eager for what was to come, and some impatient viewers started urging in the chat.\nNoland smiled and waited until the time was right before finally speaking, \"Everyone has seen the medical report. Now we will let Ensign Kruse drink the potion and see the effect. Will it be despair or a miracle? Let’s see.\"\nAfter speaking, Noland aimed the scanner at Kruse until the screen showed the same medical data as Kruse’s. Then he handed the potion to the eager Ensign Kruse.\nKruse was not in good shape. Since learning about his psychic power poisoning, he refused to rest properly. Being in despair for a long time made him look as terrible as an addict.\nAt this moment, his eyes were sunken, and his dry, twig-like hands eagerly grabbed the potion. He opened the cap and gulped it down in one go.\nBecause he drank too quickly, he choked, but he was afraid of spitting it out, so he covered his mouth tightly with both hands, his face turning red.\nThe viewers in the livestream didn’t laugh or look down on Kruse, at all.\nThey couldn’t imagine what it was like to experience such despair, and they watched in respectful silence.\nThose who had truly experienced despair could empathize with Kruse. They knew that if they were in his place, they might look even worse.\nEven though the livestream ran at a normal speed, the viewers felt like time was dragging on.\nThe only comfort was that Ensign Kruse was now sitting calmly in his chair, with a hint of contentment on his face, and he finally fell asleep comfortably.\nEveryone silently agreed not to disturb him and kept their eyes on the data on the monitor.\nThe data increased slowly, but it felt like heavy hammers striking their chests, making them blush and breathe heavily with excitement.\nWhen Kruse’s psychic power data finally showed he was healthy, the viewers went wild, their joyful cheers echoing everywhere.\nEven spies from other counties cheered when they saw the results. However, they were soon reminded by their companions, leading to embarrassed coughs and awkward silence. Deep down, they were still happy because they had family and friends who were waiting in despair, too.\nThe livestream didn’t last long, only two hours in total, but it caused a shockwave throughout the Alliance and all the nations across the galaxy, like a nuclear bomb.\nThe Alliance’s Foreign Affairs phone lines were flooded with calls from other countries, and they all wanted to buy the Psychic Healer. The Alliance responded that they would make the formula public, but the potion would only be available for purchase to non-Alliance countries after a month.\nWhen Arix saw this news, she exclaimed, \"Brilliant!\"\nMaking the formula public had pros and cons. The downside was that the Alliance wouldn’t get the biggest profit. However, the upsides were greater: it would bring a good reputation to the Alliance and allow them to escape being a target.\nAs the developer of the potion, Arix would no longer be the focus of attention. After all, if the formula was widely available, there wouldn’t be much interest in targeting her.\nThe key point was that the potion required Arix Crystal as an ingredient, and only Arix had it, which meant she had significant control over the industry.\nAt the moment, Arix was busy negotiating a contract with Quillan, who had suddenly shown up. The agreement was that she would produce the Arix Crystal, and the Alliance would give her 10% of the profits from selling it.\nArix was very tempted by the offer, but she decided to change her share of the profits from 10% to 5%.\n\"You lowered it down? Why?\" Quillan was stunned. He had never seen anyone turn down money like this before.\n\"Sir, I know many people are fighting to protect me, so I want the 5% profit to go to those protecting me and those who have been burdened because of me.\"\nLately, Arix had often seen on the interstellarnet that the Fifth Legion frequently faced insectoid invasions. She couldn’t help but think this was related to her, given her past abduction by the insectoids.\nQuillan looked deeply at the young girl before him and then saluted her, his gaze firm and solemn. \"I will convey your wishes to the president. Also, protecting you is their duty, so please don’t feel burdened.\"\nArix smiled but said nothing. After signing all the contracts, she politely saw the busy Quillan off.\nAs she watched Quillan walk away, Arix yawned sleepily. Remembering that she had to return to the training base early the next day, Arix bid goodnight to Cupid and the others before lying down and going to sleep.",

      "content": "Chapter 80: A Weak Arix\nThe next morning, Arix arrived at the training base very early. She first went to the administrative office to hand in her opticomputer. Then she returned to her dormitory.\nWhen she opened the door and walked in, she found that her roommates were already awake. They all looked surprised when they saw Arix.\n\"Hey! Our missing roommate has finally come back!\" Rei saw Arix and immediately showed a big smile, exclaiming exaggeratedly.\nLeyla and Calista rushed over, happily hugging Arix’s arms on both sides.\n\"Arix, where have you been these past ten days?\" Calista, now bolder after getting to know everyone, hugged Arix’s arm and asked sweetly.\n\"Yeah, I was so jealous of you. You don’t know how hard it has been for us at the training base. Look, my hands have become rough, and my skin has darkened,\" Leyla said, sounding very pitiful.\nShe showed her hands to Arix.\n\"The Fifth Legion needed potions, so I went to help for a while. Oh, and I brought you gifts,\" Arix explained quickly, not knowing what else to say. Then she changed the topic.\n\"Wow, what gifts?\" Rei got excited at the mention of gifts and quickly ran over to Arix, asking curiously.\n\"Don’t worry, everyone gets something.\" Arix took out a bunch of potions from her Space Button.\nShe started distributing the potions and gave detailed instructions. \"Maya, Rei, these are special Star-Class forging potions to repair your body. Leyla, I know you love beauty, so here’s a skin lotion for you to apply before bed. Lilou, I didn’t know what you’d like, so I got you a Star-Class healing potion. And Qingqing, this is a mecha model that someone in my family loves. It’s for you.\"\nArix winked at Calista with a playful smile.\nCalista blushed, but she quickly took the mecha model from Arix’s hand.\nMaya and the others were very touched by Arix’s thoughtful gifts. They each took out their most precious items from their Space Buttons and handed them to Arix.\n\"Arix, I got this by accident. I don’t know what it is, but it’s a material for making mechas. I hope you don’t mind,\" Rei said, handing Arix a box of something that looked like a mix of metal and liquid.\nRei didn’t recognize it, but Arix did. The material was called mithril. It could enhance the flexibility of mecha joints. It wasn’t very expensive but was just what Arix needed. She was so happy about the gift.\n\"Thank you, Rei, I love it,\" Arix said, taking it happily.\n\"Yeah! I love mine too,\" Rei said, smiling as she looked at her potion.\nMaya’s situation was the worst among them. In her Space Button, there was nothing precious, only a few hometown snacks that were decent enough to give as gifts.\nFeeling a bit embarrassed, she said, \"Arix, I don’t have any fancy gifts for you. Just some special snacks my parents prepared. I hope you like them.\"\nArix saw Maya’s embarrassment but genuinely liked the gift. She immediately encouraged her with a bright smile, \"Thank you, Maya. I was just wondering what to bring my parents as a gift, and now I have something. I’ll share these with them and I’m sure they’ll like it.\"\nWarmth filled Maya’s heart, and she smiled back at Arix.\n\"Arix, look at my gift!\" Leyla, finally getting her turn, said with a mischievous grin.\nArix’s eyelid twitched as she took the gift and opened it. Inside was a pink princess dress with a big bow on the chest, almost making Arix lose her composure.\nQuickly closing the lid, Arix forced a smile, trying to hide her amazement, \"Thank you, I really... like it.\"\n\"If you like it, I have many more at home... When school starts, I’ll bring a few more sets for you and the other girls,\" Leyla said. She was excited by Arix’s forced compliment, even wanting to offer dresses for the others too.\nArix and all the other one chuckled.\nFortunately, the gifts from Lilou and Calista were normal mecha materials, giving Arix a sense of relief. She never thought receiving gifts could give her such anxiety.\nThe joyful time was short-lived. Soon, Arix and the others checked the time and left the dormitory, heading to the comprehensive training ground to start their physical power training class.\nThe physical power training was the same as always: wearing weight rings and running ten kilometers.\nWhat surprised Arix was that her classmates and instructors didn’t seem surprised at her sudden return. They seemed quite used to it.\nThe students were genuinely accustomed to it since Arix trained less often than they had weekends. They all thought Arix disappeared occasionally due to health issues.\nThe instructors, knowing the real situation, turned a blind eye.\nTwo days passed, peacefully.\nOn the second day after training ended, the instructor didn’t dismiss the team as usual.\nInstead, he looked at all the students with a serious expression and said, \"The training period is almost over. For the last week, the school and training base have decided to hold a one-week-long wilderness survival competition. Unlike previous competitions, this one could be life-threatening. Participation is voluntary. If anyone does not wish to participate, you can raise your hand now to withdraw. However, withdrawing means you are no longer eligible to enter the military academy. If you want to withdraw, raise your hand now.\"\nOrtiz looked around at the students of the Hecaris Military Academy. Seeing no one raise their hand, he continued, \"Good, you are all very brave. But I also hope you do not push yourselves too hard. If you change your mind before the competition starts tomorrow, you can come to me privately. The competition starts tomorrow at 9 AM. You need to gather at the comprehensive training ground by 8 AM. Any questions?\"\n\"No, sir!\" the students of the Hecaris Military Academy responded loudly.\n\"Alright, you’re dismissed,\" Ortiz said. Then he turned and left with Virtanen and the others, seemingly busy preparing for tomorrow’s competition.",

      "content": "Chapter 81: An Incident Before The Competition\nAt the Mecha Department...\nSince yesterday, when Bernanke saw the mecha that seemed to be repaired by a helper, he had come up with an idea.\nAfter hesitating for two days, Bernanke went to the director’s office to find Magen.\n\"Sir...\" Bernanke hesitated, unsure how to start.\n\"Bernanke, what’s the matter?\" Magen asked, seeing Bernanke’s uncertain expression.\n\"Well, sir, I was looking for an assistant, and I thought the helper you arranged for me the other day was pretty good. I was wondering if they could be my assistant. What do you think?\" Bernanke finally said.\nMagen thought for a moment and then said, \"You mean her? But she’s not one of us. She can’t be your assistant, and she’s still a student.\"\n\"A student?!\" Bernanke said, surprised.\n\"Yes, she’s a student in our Department of Mecha Manufacture,\" Magen added.\n\"Are students this skilled nowadays?\" Bernanke thought of the mecha he saw repaired the other day and was amazed.\nMagen raised an eyebrow, curious. \"Is she really that good? I think she’s just a freshman.\"\nMagen thought the girl had just cleaned the mecha well and thus earned Bernanke’s approval. He liked tidy kids too.\nThinking this, Magen nodded, feeling even better about the girl. He thought he might show her more advanced mechas next time.\n\"A freshman this year? That means she’s only in her teens. She can disassemble and replace broken parts on her own without making any mistakes. That’s really impressive,\" Bernanke praised, still surprised.\nHearing this, Magen suddenly realized something. He stared at Bernanke, almost speechless, \"You mean she repaired a broken mecha by herself?\"\n\"Yes. Didn’t you find the helper for me? Why do you seem to know less than I do?\" Bernanke asked, puzzled.\nMagen kept his mouth shut in silence.\nIn fact, he just randomly grabbed someone to clean the dirty mecha. This was also Bernanke’s fault for not putting the mecha away during his break, leaving it dirty in the repair room.\nIt seemed the Mecha Department needed a new rule: except during repair time, dirty mechas must stay in the Space Button.\nThe more Magen thought about it, the more annoyed he felt with Bernanke. He might be the first to be dealt with under this new rule.\n\"Sir...\" Bernanke felt uneasy under Magen’s gaze. He swallowed nervously, and wondered what he had done wrong.\n\"No problem. Follow me and show me the mecha she repaired,\" Magen said, choosing to skip the topic for now, his tone dismissive.\nHe was very curious if the girl was really as good as Bernanke said. Magen led Bernanke to his own repair room and motioned for Bernanke to bring out the mecha.\nBernanke nodded and took out the Comet-Class mecha. The once battered and broken mecha now looked brand new, looking powerful and intimidating.\nIf Magen hadn’t seen the mecha before, he might not have recognized it. It was clear that Arix had put a lot of effort into the repair. Magen silently nodded in approval.\nThe mecha was clean and looked new—an extra point for that.\nThen Magen thoroughly inspected the mecha inside and out, his admiration growing stronger. If 100 points was the maximum, Magen would give her 99!\nThe only thing he was dissatisfied with was that he found some parts in the mecha that he hadn’t provided. Although Arix had volunteered them, Magen didn’t feel right about taking advantage of a young girl.\nThinking this, Magen sent Bernanke away and used his opticomputer to check the records of visitors to the Mecha Department from the other day.\nWhen he found Arix’s photo, his eyes lit up, and he opened the file.\nVisitor Records of the Mecha Department:\n- Name: Arix Kering\n- Gender: Female\n- Identity: Daughter of Admiral Thaddeus Kering\n- Entry Pass: One-time\n- Sponsor: Kellan Kering\nAfter reading the file, Magen was surprised. He hadn’t expected her to be the granddaughter of an old friend.\nThinking of the sweet and well-behaved girl, Magen started to feel a bit jealous of Matis.\n’How does that old rascal get all the good luck?’\nThe woman he once had a crush on married Matis instead, and even Matis’s children were exceptional. Now, Matis had a lovely granddaughter too.\nFor the first time in his life, the lonely Magen felt a bit empty and cold.\nMagen sighed deeply, then he opened his opticomputer to contact someone he had labeled as \"old hypocrite.\"\n\"Well, well, a rare guest! What brings you here?\" Matis’s smiling face appeared on the 3D virtual screen.\nFrom the moment he saw Matis, Magen’s expression soured, but he forced himself to hold back his dislike. \"Arix, she’s your granddaughter, right?\"\nMatis raised his eyebrows in surprise and replied, \"Yes, my little granddaughter. Why?\"\n\"I want her to study mecha with me. Make it happen,\" Magen said bluntly.\nMatis was speechless.\nThis wasn’t something he could just decide. Ever since Arix developed the Psychic Healer, more and more people had opposed her staying in the Mecha Department.\nRecently, Matis had begun to have doubts himself. So when he heard Magen’s words, his expression finally turned serious. \"Are you sure Arix is suitable for mecha?\"\n\"Hey! Old hypocrite, what do you mean by that? Are you questioning Arix, or are you questioning me, a master of mecha?\" Magen was furious, his eyes blazing as he glared at Matis.\n\"Ahem.. Why do you always come up with these nicknames? Anyway, this isn’t something that can be explained in just a few words. Many people are against Arix staying in the Department of Mecha Manufacture. If you can take Arix as an apprentice, it would actually be a good thing,\" Matis said, exasperated by the ongoing issue.\nLately, Matis had been stressed to the point of losing hair over this matter. Almost everyone who learned that Arix was in the Department of Mecha Manufacture gave him a look of reproach, as if saying,\n’A child doesn’t know any better, but you, an adult, are encouraging this nonsense. A genius in potion-making, and you’re letting her waste time on forging mechas.’",

      "content": "Chapter 82: A Hard Choice\nMatis really felt like he had no way to express his frustration.\nThose stubborn old people from the potion association... when they couldn’t reach Arix, who was in training, they blamed Matis, as he was the head of the Kering family.\nThey bombarded him with texts every ten minutes and video calls every hour for two days straight. He was so annoyed that he wanted to go and bombard the potion association, and with his real guns and cannons!\nMagen didn’t care if Matis was having a hard time. Seeing that Matis didn’t object, Magen’s face softened a bit. He even patiently explained, \"Your granddaughter has a great talent for mecha. If she is trained well, I bet you she’ll achieve a lot.\"\n\"Can she become a master?\" Matis asked casually.\nBut Magen was speechless. ’The girl was just a toddler in this field, yet Matis is already thinking about making her fly. Does he really trust his granddaughter this much, or is he just a fool?’\nIt was like a teacher saying a student had good talent, and the parent immediately asking if the student could get into Harvard.\n\"Do you know what you’re saying?\" Magen said calmly at first, but then he burst out, \"Do you think becoming a master is that easy? It takes more than hopes and expectations, okay?\"\nMatis was scolded harshly. He rubbed his nose, feeling wronged, and said, \"Magen, I didn’t mean that. I meant that if Arix doesn’t have the potential to become a master in mecha, she might not be able to study mecha peacefully in the Department of Mecha Manufacture.\"\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Magen’s frown deepened. He felt like Matis was hinting at something.\n\"Many people are against Arix staying in the Department of Mecha Manufacture. They want her to switch majors and focus on potion studies,\" Matis explained openly.\nAfter all, if Magen became her mecha teacher in the future, he would eventually understand the headache.\n\"So what? Your granddaughter loves mecha. Are you going to stop her from studying it because of what others say?\" Magen looked at Matis with a disgusted expression.\n\"Magen, you don’t realize how serious this is. Do you know the most famous psychic power healing potion recently?\" Matis asked.\n\"Yes, I know. So what does that have to do with your granddaughter? Are you going to tell me that she developed it?\" Magen rolled his eyes sarcastically.\nMatis had expected Magen’s reaction. After all, the truth was so unbelievable that nobody with basic chemistry knowledge would believe it easily.\nWith a helpless sigh, Matis said, \"The Psychic Healer was developed by Arix. So now the potion association might force Arix to switch majors when the school year starts.\"\n\"Really? You’re not lying to me?\" Magen asked in shock and disbelief.\nMatis nodded seriously. He wouldn’t joke about something so serious.\nMagen’s frown deepened. He didn’t expect the information to be so overwhelming that it almost made him feel like his back was giving out.\nHe couldn’t believe that a fifteen-year-old girl had developed the psychic power healing potion. This potion wasn’t just an ordinary one; it was a lifesaver for countless people!\nNow, it wasn’t just the potion association; even he began to wonder if Arix continuing to study mecha was wasting her talent in potion making.\nIf she continued in the Department of Chemistry, she might become the next legendary potion master!\nBut Magen couldn’t bear the thought of forcing a girl who loved mecha so much to study only potions. It felt wrong.\n\"I will take Arix as my apprentice, but if she really has no talent for mecha, I will guide her to focus more on potions,\" Magen said, rubbing his brow and sighing heavily.\nHearing this, Matis breathed a sigh of relief and smiled. \"Thank you. When the school term starts, I’ll have her add you on her opticomputer.\"\n\"Okay. If there’s nothing else, I’ll hang up now.\" Magen ended the call and looked towards the training base next door.\nHe felt uncertain. He didn’t know if he was making the right decision, but he wouldn’t regret it. He wanted to protect the light in that child’s eyes because he knew the pain of wanting to study mecha but being unable to.\nWhen Magen was very young, his parents both died for the Alliance. Without their protection, his relatives took over his family’s property and kicked him out of his home. He ended up on the street as a beggar.\nDuring his time on the streets, he envied mecha makers. On one hand, he loved mecha, on the other hand, those people were so well respected and lived a well-off life.\nMagen swore that he’d try his best to be a mecha maker.\nBut without money to attend a proper school, Magen had to sneak into classes and watch from the corners. Too many time were he caught by security, beaten up, and thrown out like garbage.\nDespite this, Magen never gave up. After many attempts, he succeed—someone either gave orders or the security guards just turned a blind eye to him.\nLater, he found out that the person who helped him was Matis, who also helped him reclaim his inheritance, allowing him to study legitimately.\nThe two became brothers, until both fell in love with Arix’s grandmother, which strained their relationship.\nDespite this, both Matis and Frances were crucial in Magen’s life, so he chose to step aside early, letting Matis and Frances be together.\nAfter recalling the pains of his youth, Magen skillfully took a photo out of the drawer. He looked nostalgically at the young girl with a radiant smile in the photo.\nAs he looked, a bittersweet smile appeared on Magen’s lips. \"Frances, if you had stayed a little longer, you could see your granddaughter now. She’s a remarkable and outstanding child. If you saw her, you would definitely like her.\"\nThe photo couldn’t speak, but the girl’s smile remained as if in agreement.",

      "content": "Chapter 83: Preparations\nThe sun had just risen over the training base, but the comprehensive training ground was already bustling with activity.\nThe place was filled with a large number of military students, and even teachers from various military academies had appeared at the base.\nLeading them was the examiner from the five military academies. The students had already seen them at the entrance exam.\nArix saw Marlone, one of the five examiners, on the podium. They noticed each other and exchanged smiles and waves due to the formal setting.\nAt 8 AM, with everyone gathered, the instructors confirmed the student numbers from each academy and began the pre-competition preparations.\nThe rules for the competition stated that no external items were allowed. The students had to hand over everything except their clothes, digital wristbands, and a knife given by the instructors. Even their Space Buttons were taken away, causing many students to groan in protest.\nThey would be spending a whole week outdoors with no gear, which seemed very harsh. They wondered what good a small knife could do. Could it feed them? Keep them warm at night? Provide any real sense of security?\nIn the age of space travel, military students were used to advanced weapons, and a small knife seemed as useful as a nail clipper to them. Useful, but not much.\nHowever, faced with the threat of losing points, the students had no choice but to comply and stay quiet.\nAfter the preparations, Nyx, the head of the training base, finally spoke from the podium. \"Hello, students! Your month of freshman training is coming to an end. To conclude, we have decided to hold a competition to see how much you’ve improved. So, do you have confidence in yourselves? Answer me loudly.\"\nThe students grumbled internally but still shouted, \"Yes, sir!\"\nNyx nodded with a smile, \"Good. Now, I will announce the rules. This competition requires teamwork. Each team earns one point for every beast they kill. The top ten teams will receive an extra 100 points. Each team consists of five people, based on your wristband numbers. Teams 1-5, 6-10, and so on. Survive in the Sugli Forest for a week, and you pass. Here’s a note for you: if you feel your life is in danger, remove your wristband, and an instructor will locate and retrieve you. Now, get ready to board the warships.\"\nWith that, six massive warships from the Fifth Legion base landed in front of the comprehensive training ground.\nThe instructors led their students from each academy onto separate warships. Once all the students were aboard, the examiners and the training base leaders boarded their own warship.\nThen, the six warships flew south together.\nInside the Hecaris Military Academy warship, students were calling out numbers to find their teammates based on their wristbands. After half an hour, Arix finally met up with her team. Her four teammates were three boys and one girl. To Arix’s surprise, two of them were people she knew.\n\"Arix! I can’t believe we’re teammates!\" Calista said excitedly, linking her arm with Arix.\n\"And my brother is also a teammate,\" Arix said, glancing at Drexel. She looked at Calista and laughed.\nArix had already expected Drexel to be her teammate since he was standing next to her when they received their number plates. Drexel’s number was 70, which was close to hers. The only surprise was that Calista’s number was 66. What a coincidence!\nCalista shyly held Arix’s arm, stealing glances at Drexel.\n’Such a cute little fangirl!’\nArix thought, hugging her own arm and refusing to admit she was a bit jealous of how her friend was so obsessed with Drexel.\n\"Arix, come over here with your friend. Let’s discuss the competition,\" Drexel said. He didn’t notice the little secret between Arix and Calista.\nDrexel and the other two teammates were already discussing the Sugli Forest.\nArix and Calista joined them, and the teammates sized each other up.\n\"We’ll be together for a week, so let’s start with introductions. I’ll go first. I’m Drexel from the Department of Combat. I’m studying command as a second major. My psychic and physical powers are both Supergiant-Class. If we’ll agree, I proposed to be the team leader for this competition,\" Drexel said, his expression serious and reliable.\nAt home, Drexel could laugh and play without restraint, but in front of others, he was the rightful heir of the Kering family and possibly a future admiral.\nEven Arix had to admit that Drexel was very charismatic like this. It was no wonder he had so many admirers at the Hecaris Military Academy.\nArix glanced at Calista, who was looking at Drexel with admiration, and sighed.\nThe other teammates exchanged looks and nodded in agreement with Drexel taking the lead.\n\"Next, it’s my turn. I’m Arix from the Mecha Department and the Department of Chemistry. My psychic power is Supergiant-Class, and my physical power is Star-Class. Nice to meet you all,\" Arix said with a smile.\n\"My name is Calista, from the Department of Chemistry. Both my psychic power and physical power are Star-Class. Nice to see you,\" Calista introduced herself shyly.\n\"My name is Femi, from the Psychic Ware Department. My psychic power is Star-Class, and my physical power is Planet-Class. Good to see you guys,\" Femi said. He had a baby face, and even his personality and eyes were a bit childish.\n\"My name is Dae-jung, from the Department of Combat. My physical power is Subgiant-Class, and my psychic power is Star-Class. Nice to meet you,\" Dae-jung introduced himself. He was a handsome young man, but his personality was a bit cold and distant, giving off a feeling of a cold moonlit night.\n\"Good, now we all know each other,\" Drexel said. \"We need to survive in the Sugli Forest for a week. The key is teamwork. When we encounter beasts, we must stay calm and work together. My plan is to first establish a safe camp. During the day, we’ll search for food and water, and at night, we’ll take turns keeping watch. Does anyone have any questions or suggestions?\"\nThe others shook their heads, agreeing with the plan.\nFollow current novels on freewe(b)novel.c(o)m",

      "content": "Chapter 84: Arriving At Sugli Forest\nAfter everyone introduced themselves, Drexel began to speak. \"Let’s talk about The Sugli Forest. Everyone, share what you know about it. Then, we will summarize and decide our next steps. Arix, you go first.\"\nArix nodded. Then, looking at everyone, he said, \"I don’t know much about The Sugli Forest. I only know it covers more than 500 hectares. There are many strange beasts living there, and in the center, there are Celesterrors, which are basically like monsters. So, unless it’s necessary, I suggest not going to the center.\"\nCelesterrors were different from normal beasts. They had powerful psychic abilities, and were born with Star-Class physical power, which gets stronger as they age. They are so formidable that even insectoids avoid them.\nMost importantly, in the Alliance, Celesterror were protected animals, like rhinos in the past world. People couldn’t kill, sell, or hurt them, unless one wanted to end up in jail or worse.\nHearing Arix’s words, everyone nodded in agreement. Then they all looked at the next person.\nCalista felt nervous with everyone looking at her, especially since Drexel was watching too. She couldn’t speak at all. Seeing this, Arix gently held her hand to encourage her, as if silently saying,\n’Don’t be afraid, I’m here with you!’\nCalista felt warm inside and finally gathered some courage. \"I once went to the edge of The Sugli Forest with my dad. The thing I remember most is that there are many poisonous insects and leeches, so we should prepare before going into the forest.\"\n\"That’s very useful information. Calista, you and Arix will handle the insect repellent, okay?\" Drexel asked, looking at both of them.\nArix nodded calmly, and Calista nodded excitedly, even making little fists with her hands.\nThen it was Femi’s turn. He seemed oddly excited. \"I’ve heard that The Sugli Forest has little pigs. They are a top ingredient in the Alliance’s high-end restaurants. And there are also matsutake mushrooms, hazelnuts, and\"\n\"Stop! That’s enough. You will handle the food,\" Drexel said quickly, cutting him off.\n\"No problem! Leave it to me.\" Femi nodded enthusiastically and agreed readily.\nDrexel breathed a sigh of relief, then looked at Dae-jung. \"What about you, Dae-jung?\"\n\"The most dangerous thing out there isn’t the forest, but the people,\" Dae-jung said seriously. \"The Sugli Forest’s Celesterrors are always targets for poachers, and there are many mercenaries too. Poachers are easy to guard against, but mercenaries are unpredictable. I suggest we keep our distance from them during the competition.\"\nDrexel thought for a moment before replying, \"Dae-jung has a point. But usually, the area is closed off before the student competitions to protect students and prevent cheating. So, we’ll consider your suggestion. Does anyone else have any ideas? If not, I’ll share some thoughts for everyone to consider.\"\nThe four nodded and focused on Drexel, waiting for him to speak.\n\"I’ve only been to The Sugli Forest once. What everyone said is mostly right, but there’s another thing I need to emphasize. With autumn approaching, the beasts are starting to gather food. The herbivores aren’t much of a problem, but the carnivores might see us as food. So, our main concern should be those beasts. We also need to take turns keeping watch at night. This task will be handled by us three guys. Now...\" Drexel continued to discuss possible situations they might encounter during the competition.\nAmidst their discussion, the flight of their spaceship reached its destination. Six large warships landed at the outer edge of the Sugli Forest. Hundreds of people, stopped by a security cordon a hundred meters away, were talking about the closure of the forest.\n\"A military academy, no less. They shut down the entire Sugli Forest for a kids’ competition!\" a disgruntled mercenary complained.\n\"Those ’kids’ could beat you so out of shape that your wife wouldn’t recognize you,\" an older mercenary retorted with a roll of his eyes.\n\"Exactly, and those ’kids’ will protect you, your wife, and your children on the front lines someday. Don’t you feel ashamed saying such things?\" another mercenary added.\nThe complaining mercenary fell silent and walked away.\n\"Hmph!\" The other mercenaries continued to watch the six warships, eager to see the spectacle.\nWhen the students disembarked, the mercenaries exclaimed in surprise, as if a group of baboons had descended from the mountains.\nArix and his friends were drawn by the noise and turned to see the people standing a hundred meters away behind the security cordon.\nThey wore a mix of lightweight, worn-out combat gear, and their weapons ranged from guns to clubs and large machetes. Just by looking at them, it was clear they were mercenaries who lived by hunting.\nThe military students curiously watched the mercenaries, just as the mercenaries, who rarely saw military students, watched them. Both groups observed each other with interest.\nSome particularly outgoing mercenaries started cheering for the military students.\n\"Kids! Go for it! You’re the best!\"\n\"The next Alliance admiral is among you! Go, go, go!\"\n\"You can do it, kids! Ura! Ura!\"\nThe students, feeling the mercenaries’ enthusiasm, responded warmly.\n\"Thank you! But we’re not kids!\"\n\"Haha!\" The mercenaries laughed at the students’ response and teased them even more enthusiastically.\nThe instructors stood by, watching the bickering between the mercenaries and the military students. Instead of stopping them, they raised their eyebrows and smiled, enjoying the show.\nWhen it was almost 9 o’clock, an instructor coughed to get the students’ attention. Then, the instructor said seriously, \"The competition is about to start. Kids, get yourselves ready.\"\n\"Yes, sir!\" the students replied loudly. Some students waved goodbye to the mercenaries.\nAt 9 o’clock, the instructor announced the start of the competition. All the military students rushed into The Sugli Forest like a swarm of migrating mule deer.\nAfter the students left, the sixth spaceship unloaded at least a thousand soldiers. They wore silver-white combat suits that could make them invisible. After disembarking, they disappeared upon receiving a command.\nThe soldiers used tracking bracelets to locate the students they were assigned to follow. They hid around the students, watching carefully to see if they were in any danger. They’ll interven if necessary.\nSoldiers following students from a humble background had it easier, since these students had some knowledge of survival skills.\nThose following the rich kids, on the contrary, had a hard time. Quite a few rich kids didn’t take any precautions and got bitten by poisonous insects, causing them to go into shock or faint from fear.\nOne student got bitten by a leech and just stared at it in terror.\n’Why don’t you pull it off?’\nthe soldier thought as he observed in a distance.\nThe student fainted, convinced he wouldn’t survive the leech bite, and he even carved a farewell message on a tree before passing out.\n’Is he really that fragile... but he just...’\nthe soldier wondered.",

      "content": "Chapter 85: Surviving The Wild\nThe soldier checked the fainted student’s condition. After confirming he was unconscious, the soldier came out of hiding. They removed the bracelet from the student who was in shock from the insect bite and quickly sent them to a waiting Lev.\nFor the student who fainted from the leech, the soldier felt a headache. This student wasn’t in immediate danger but was unconscious and could be at risk.\nThe soldier shook his head as he looked at the message carved on the tree. Then, he decided to stay with the student until he woke up. But he wasn’t going to do anything to wake the student up, so whether he could make it would depend on their luck.\nThe Sugli Forest was vast, and Arix and the others didn’t know what was happening to the other students.\nTheir first task was to find a tree suitable for making ropes. They peeled its bark and started making ropes of various thicknesses.\nOnce everyone had some rope, they used thin ropes to tie around their sleeves and pant legs. This way, they could effectively prevent insects from crawling into their clothes.\nWith basic protection done, Arix and the others began to collect ingredients that could repel insects, snakes, and ants. They also gathered medicinal ingredients when they found them.\nDrexel led the group, focusing on finding a water source. In the wild, drinking water, washing, cooking, and cooling all depend on water, making it a crucial part of survival.\nThey moved forward, observing plant growth and the direction of dense roots. Occasionally, Drexel would put his ear to the ground, listening for the sound of water.\nAfter a while, Drexel finally heard the faint sound of flowing water. It wasn’t loud, but it meant that a water source was nearby. Feeling pleased, Drexel stood up and blew a loud whistle with his fingers.\nThe four teammates who were gathering nearby immediately looked up, alert, and quickly returned to Drexel.\nSoon, the five of them were together. Arix and Calista each carried some bundled medicinal ingredients. Femi had tied up a few rabbits and wild chickens with rope, while Dae-jung had used large leaves to hold a lot of fruit.\n\" Drexel, did you find something?\" Femi asked curiously.\nDrexel nodded, \"I heard the gurgling of water. Let’s stick together for now and not split up.\"\nArix and the others agreed. Not long after, they found a creek.\nWith water secured, they could now start a fire and cook. Each person took on a different task: some carved wooden bowls with knives, some used sticks to make fire, and others cleaned the game by the river.\nArix was making a water filter. She carved several pieces of wood with her knife, drilled a hole in the bottom, and lined the bottom with deodorized hemp rope.\nShe then added layers of charcoal, stones, fine sand, stones, and water plants. She tied the simple filter high up with hemp rope and poured river water into the wood container, letting the clean water collect in the container below.\nEveryone worked with enthusiasm because these tasks were new to them and seemed quite interesting. When it was finally time to eat, each person had a skewer of grilled meat and a portion of boiled filtered water.\nThe meal was simple, but Femi’s cooking skills were good. After tasting the food, almost everyone gave him a thumbs-up.\nTo keep up their strength, Drexel and his team even caught a deer and collected five bowls of blood. Each person pinched their nose to avoid the smell and drank a bowl.\nIn the wild, salt is essential for maintaining strength, and when there’s no salt, drinking animal blood can help replenish it.\nAfter drinking the blood and rinsing their mouths, Arix and the team began eating and discussing their next moves.\nThe competition was not only about surviving in the wilderness but also about hunting fierce beasts to earn points.\n\"After we finish eating and resting for a bit, let’s move deeper into the forest,\" Dae-jung suggested. \"The outer area is safer, but there are fewer beasts, so it’s hard to earn points.\"\n\"Femi and Dae-jung are the strongest fighters among us. If we’re hunting beasts, they can lead the attack. Calista and I can provide support, and Arix can finish off the beasts. How does that sound?\" Drexel suggested, his eyes gleaming with excitement.\nThe others nodded in agreement, thinking it was a good plan.\n\"If we encounter something too tough to handle, we should retreat for now. Don’t push too hard. The forest is still unknown territory. Today, we should focus on exploring and understanding the environment before deciding our next steps,\" Drexel added after some thought.\nThe team agreed, ready to face the challenges ahead in their quest for survival and victory.\nHalf an hour passed, and Arix’s group finished their discussion. They rested for a bit before heading into the inner part of the forest.\nBefore reaching the inner part, Arix and the others could relax a bit. But as soon as they entered the area where strange beasts appeared, they formed an arrow-shape formation and moved forward cautiously.\nDrexel held a dagger and led the way. Arix and Calista, also holding daggers, walked alertly on either side behind Drexel.\nBehind Arix’s group were Femi and Dae-jung. Dae-jung not only watched over Femi but also kept an eye on the rear to prevent any beasts from attacking from behind.\n\"Roar!\"\nThe deafening beast roar made Drexel motion for a pause. Drexel then looked at Arix and nodded.\nArix understood and quickly climbed a tree to look for the source of the sound from a higher vantage point.\nWhile doing this, Arix felt a strange sense of familiarity, as if she had done this before. She shook her head to clear her thoughts and focused on the direction of the roar.\nThere were five beasts, as large as prehistoric creatures, attacking some students from the Hecaris Military Academy. Two of the students were already seriously injured.\nArix swallowed nervously. These beasts in this interstellar era were different from what she had imagined. She thought they would be like the wild animals from her past life.\nIf she wasn’t mistaken, these looked like brown bears, but now they were bigger than elephants.\nMaybe as humans evolved, so did the beasts.\nSeeing the five students in danger, Arix couldn’t think too much and called down to the others, \"There’s a group of our classmates from the Hecaris Military Academy ahead, surrounded by five strange brown bears. Should we help?\"\n\"Go help them!\" Drexel said firmly, out of concern for their classmates.\n\"Yes, get them now!\" Dae-jung agreed, though he was more excited about earning points. Helping others was just a bonus.\n\"Alright!\" Arix jumped down from the tree and quickly led the way towards the northwest.\n\"Arix, is it the northwest? This is too slow. Dae-jung and I will go ahead first,\" Drexel said, frowning.\n\"Yes, it’s the northwest, about 500 meters away. You two go ahead; we’ll catch up soon,\" Arix said seriously.\n\"Okay!\" Drexel nodded decisively. He told Arix to be careful, then he and Dae-jung quickly disappeared from sight.\nArix, left behind, watched the two move like lightning with envy. She gritted her teeth and ran faster in Drexel’s direction.\nLuckily, the incident site wasn’t far. When Arix and the others arrived, Drexel and Dae-jung had already killed one of the bears.\nAt that moment, they were fighting four bears, desperately trying to prevent them from further injuring the five students.\nThe students were either seriously or lightly wounded.\nArix watched worriedly for a while, ensuring that Drexel and Dae-jung were not in immediate danger, and then she breathed a little easier.\nShe quickly turned to Calista and Femi, \"Let’s go check on them.\"\n\"Okay,\" Calista and Femi nodded vigorously. They followed Arix and quickly reached the five injured students, and then they began to check their conditions.\nArix went to the most severely injured student. He was already unconscious, and Arix started examining him.\nThe student had a dislocated left arm, a severe wound that was bleeding heavily, and several minor injuries that were not too serious.\nAfter understanding the basic situation, Arix started treatment right away. She pressed the pressure point on the student’s arm to stop the bleeding.\nThen she carefully tore open the student’s shirt. After taking three hemostatic herbs from her waist, she chewed them, and applied them to the wound.\nThe dislocation was easier to handle. Arix pressed a few times and then set the arm back in place with one strong motion.\nThe other students and Calista were astonished at Arix’s treatment speed.\nIt seemed like her medical skills were as good as a treatment capsule’s.\n’Is she some kind of medical genius?’\nthey wondered.\nBusy with her tasks, Arix didn’t notice her friends’ reactions. She quickly moved to another severely injured and unconscious student.\nShe told Calista, who was treating him, \"Calista, let me handle this one. Please watch over the student beside you. Tell me if anything goes wrong.\"\n\"Okay!\" Calista nodded firmly.\nCalista checked the student Arix had just treated and was amazed that such severe injuries had been handled so easily.\n’How did she managed to heal him without a treatment capsule or medicines? Is it magic?’\nCalista looked at Arix with a mix of shock and admiration. She had thought Drexel was impressive, but Arix was even more so. She felt like she might switch her admiration from Drexel to Arix now.\nTreating injuries was as natural to Arix as breathing. In less than ten minutes, she had also saved the other severely injured student.\nMeanwhile, Calista had already helped the three less seriously injured students.\nAfter ensuring all the injured students were taken care of, Arix breathed a sigh of relief and then turned her attention to the battlefield.\nWhile Arix watched Drexel and Dae-jung fight, on the Sixth Warship’s meeting room...\nFive examiners and five chief training instructors, along with the head of the training base, Nyx, were discussing Arix.\n\"A master-level doctor wouldn’t be better than this!\" Mendez commented, adjusting his glasses while watching Arix on the live feed.\n\"Arix has always been excellent,\" Ortiz added, praising her. After all, having such an outstanding student made him proud as her instructor.\n\"Well well... This little one always brings us so many surprises. I suddenly want to knock her down and take her home secretly,\" Laiden joked with a chuckle.\n\"Hmph!\" Marlone snorted proudly, feeling too good to even bother arguing with him.\nThe only person feeling uneasy was Solis from the Koros Military Academy. Arix had once been their student, and now they had lost her to the Hecaris Military Academy.\nThinking about this, Solis’s mood soured even more. Only someone who had lost a billion-dollar lottery could understand his current feeling.\nThe more Solis thought about it, the more he slumped in his chair, feeling completely dejected.",

      "content": "Chapter 86: Two \"Monsters\"\nIn the Sugli Forest...\nAn angry brown bear roared at Drexel and Dae-jung. His sharp claws and scary teeth kept attacking the two people.\nSometimes, the bear even lifted his huge paw, like a small mountain, and stomped where they stood. The power of his stomp left deep holes in the ground.\nDespite this scary attack, Drexel and Dae-jung did not panic. Instead, they worked well together.\nDrexel faced the bear and attacked him directly, while Dae-jung, like a sneaky assassin, kept bothering the bear. Sometimes, when he saw a chance, he would stab his knife into the bear’s eyes or the soft skin on his neck.\nThe rest of the bear’s body was as tough as iron, and they couldn’t hurt him at all.\nOutside the battle, Arix noticed what was happening and felt very frustrated.\nArix had thought that the beasts from the interstellar era would be like the ones she had seen in her last life. So, she thought a knife would be enough.\nBut when she saw these beasts, she realized how hard the training base was on them.\nIt was like giving the students forks and knives to fight lions and elephants.\nIt was clear that the training base didn’t care about their lives, or at least Arix thought so.\nArix rubbed her forehead, sighed, and then said to Calista and Femi, \"I’ll go help. You two stay here and take care of the injured ones.\"\nCalista and Femi, a chemist and a Psychic Ware user, couldn’t help much in this fight. If they went there, they would just be food for the beast.\nCalista knew this too, so she helplessly said to Arix, \"Arix, be careful.\"\nArix nodded. Then she took out her knife and rushed to the battlefield.\nShe couldn’t fight the bear head-on, so she, like Dae-jung, kept bothering him.\n\"Arix, why are you here too?\" Drexel didn’t want Arix to help.\nArix gave Drexel an annoyed look and said, \"What? You think I’ll slow you down? Want to bet who can kill more?\"\n\"Sure, if I win, you have to call me ’respected brother’ every day during the competition,\" Drexel said as he jumped left and turned to avoid the bear’s claws. He teased Arix while doing so.\nArix raised an eyebrow and, even more annoyed, said, \"Fine, if I win, you have to call me ’big sis’ during this whole competition!\"\n\"No problem, deal!\" Drexel confidently smiled. Then his strong psychic power flowed out from his body.\nThat scary psychic power gradually turned into an ice-blue spear in Drexel’s hand.\nPsychic power materialization is a very magical skill. It can turn imagined things into reality, sometimes even stronger than the real thing.\nBut to achieve this, one must have complete control over their psychic power, and it must be at least Star-Class level.\nThey also need to practice for many years to use materialized weapons smoothly. Otherwise, the materialized objects would shatter like fireworks on contact, having no attack effect at all.\nWith the materialized icy spear, Drexel stopped avoiding the bear and charged at him.\nWhen he got close, he leaped up, grabbed the spear with both hands, and thrust it down hard.\nThe fierce bear didn’t even know what happened before the spear pierced his head, freezing him in place.\nDrexel grinned, withdrew the spear, and jumped off the bear’s head.\nWhen he landed, the bear fell too, kicking up a cloud of dust.\nDrexel’s first kill in this competition was complete, and other people almost wanted to applaud for his amazing show.\nArix couldn’t materialize psychic power yet, but her psychic power was already the strongest weapon. This was something even Drexel couldn’t match.\nA powerful wave of psychic power surged from Arix’s body. Then she, like a drill, pierced another bear’s head. The bear let out a miserable cry, then mysteriously fell to the ground, bleeding from his eyes, nose, ears, and mouth, dead.\nPsychic power piercing was a direct attack using psychic power. If someone was hit by it, at best, they became an idiot; at worst, like the bear in front of them, they’d suffer brain death.\nThe only drawback of psychic power piercing was that it consumed a lot of psychic power, unlike materialized weapons, which saved more energy.\nDrexel looked at the bear who died miserably and swallowed hard. He thought, \"How did my sister’s psychic power become so scary?\"\nThe remaining two bears, seeing their companion’s tragic death, were scared and tried to run back into the forest.\nBut Arix and Drexel wouldn’t let them escape. They both chased after them.\nArix’s psychic power, like a drill, pierced one bear’s head.\nDrexel used all his strength to throw the materialized spear like a javelin. The spear shoot across the trees like a falling star, and at last, it pierced the other bear right on his head..\nFinally, they heard two miserable cries, and the two poor bears fell to the ground, lifeless.\n\"It’s a tie. Looks like we won’t hear Arix call me ’respected brother,’ too bad,\" Drexel said regretfully.\nArix rolled her eyes and snorted.\nAnd Dae-jung, who had watched the entire process from the side, looked at the siblings like they were monsters.\n’These two really deserve to be siblings, each more terrifying than the other’!\nDae-jung had some mental preparation for Drexel’s ferocity. After all, Drexel was the heir of the Kering family, so he was definitely not weak.\nBut Arix truly surprised him. He had thought Arix was a gentle and obedient girl. However, she only looked gentle and obedient. When she got fierce, she was as terrifying as a wild beast.\nDae-jung looked at the siblings with complicated feelings. Then he turned and walked towards Femi and the others.\nAfter spending time with such monsters, he now preferred to stay with normal people.\nHowever, this unexpected shock gave Dae-jung a mental shadow. He decided that he would never trust people who looked gentle and obedient again, as they might suddenly turn into someone like Arix.\nAfter cleaning up the whole place and collecting the furs, Arix and the others helped their injured classmates find a safe cave.\nThen they left them there and headed to the place they were going to.\nWith their classmates watching sadly, Arix and the others waved. Then, they turned and headed deeper into the forest.\nIn the afternoon, Arix and the group hunted and killed a few more wild beasts.\nWhen the sky turned red with the sunset, Arix reminded them, \"It’s getting late. Let’s continue tomorrow.\"\nDrexel looked at the sky and agreed, \"Okay, let’s find a place by the river to rest.\"\nSoon, they found a suitable cave. They set up camp there.\nAfter securing a place to stay, it was time to think about dinner. As for the chef tonight...\nEveryone looked at Femi. He was the only one in the group who could cook decent food.\nDrexel and Dae-jung were rough guys who would rather eat raw food than cook, because their dishes tasted worse than raw food.\nArix’s food tasted good, but it seemed cursed. Out of three meals, two would definitely cause stomach problems.\nThe memory of sending Cassian to the hospital was still fresh, so she dared not cook anymore. Even if she did, she wouldn’t let her teammates eat it, for fear they might be eliminated not by beasts, but by her cooking. That would make her famous again in the five military academies.\nCalista liked to cook, but her food was so bad that even a captured rabbit refused to eat it and starved to death. The rabbit proved with its life how terrible Calista’s cooking was.\nThe more they thought about it, the more grateful they were to have Femi. Without him, the next seven days would be unbearable.\nAfter helping prepare the ingredients and setting out the plates, fruits, and water, they all sat neatly on the ground, waiting for Femi to serve them.\nSoon, Femi came into the cave with five leaf-wrapped packages. He gave the two smaller ones to Arix and Calista. The remaining three, he shared among the boys.\nArix thanked him and eagerly opened her leaf package. Inside were evenly cut pieces of roasted meat, smelling delicious.\nThe boys didn’t have it as good. Their leaf packages also had roasted meat, but not cut, so they had to use their knives to cut it themselves.\nArix looked at the delicious roasted meat and swallowed. Then, Arix picked up a piece with chopsticks and happily chewed it.\n\"Wow! This is delicious! Femi, you’re amazing.\" Arix was impressed after the first bite and gave Femi a thumbs up.\n\"Yes, it’s so good!\" Calista also gave a thumbs up.\n\"It’s really good!\" Drexel, too, gave a thumbs up.\nDae-jung didn’t say anything, but he nodded to show his approval.\n\"It even tastes salty. Femi, where did you find salt?\" Calista asked, puzzled. In a forest, there shouldn’t be any salt.\nFemi blushed from the compliments and smiled shyly. Then he answered, \"In the afternoon, I found a saltbush. Its fruits have a salty coating that can replace salt for now.\"\n\"Oh, it’s a saltbush!\" Calista realized.\n\"Yes, that’s it,\" Femi smiled.\n\"Femi is amazing,\" the four of them looked admiringly at the person who would be their provider for the next seven days.\nAfter dinner, everyone planned to rest early. Arix and Calista slept together in a cave. The three boys took turns keeping watch by the fire.",

      "content": "Chapter 87: Psychic Weapons\nThe next day, before dawn, Arix woke up, stretched, and walked out of the cave.\n\"Arix, it’s still early. Do you want to sleep a bit more?\" Drexel was on the last watch and showed concern for his sister waking up so early.\nArix shook her head and sat next to Drexel, \"You go sleep. I’ll keep watch.\"\nDrexel was touched and looked at his sister with pride, \"Surprise, surprise. The heartless Arix has grown up and started to care about me.\"\nArix felt annoyed and a vein popped on her forehead. She glared at Drexel and said, \"Now choose: go to hell, or go to sleep?\"\n\"Sleep!\" Drexel jumped up and quickly moved away from Arix. As he entered the cave, he added, \"Arix, with a temper like that, you’ll never get a boyfriend.\"\nArix didn’t want to respond and threw a small stick at him.\nDrexel caught the stick, smiling. He didn’t want to throw it away and took it into the cave with him.\nWhen it got quiet, Arix poked the fire with a stick, watching the flames grow.\nYesterday’s bear attack still affected her. Even though she had been in this era for almost two months, her mind was still in the past, thinking like she was still on Earth.\nFor example, many species here were different from those on Earth, but Arix instinctively compared them to Earth creatures in her imagination. In the end, it was because she hadn’t fully accepted that she could never return to Earth.\nAfter all, she still had her parents who raised her, the elders who always criticized but also protected her, and her childhood friend who joked about wanting her to take care of him but ended up taking care of her. These bonds were the deepest for Arix and were impossible to forget.\nThe more she thought about it, the more it hurt. Arix sighed heavily and looked dejectedly at the fire burning in the pit. The warm firelight only highlighted the loneliness and sadness on her face.\n\"Arix, a penny for you thought?\"\nCupid was very sensitive to emotions. He suddenly felt Arix was unhappy in the psychic world, so he quickly left the psychic world. Then he jumped into Arix’s arms and asked in a cute voice.\nSeeing Cupid acting cute, Arix finally smiled and gently petted Cupid’s head. Then, Arix spoke with some emotion, \"I was thinking about what happened yesterday. I didn’t expect the beasts of this world to be so big. When I saw them yesterday, I was really surprised.\"\n\"Arix, don’t be afraid. I will protect you,\" Cupid said, thinking Arix was still scared. He rubbed its small head against Arix’s hand to comfort her.\n\"We will protect you too,\" said Sophia and Vita, who had also come out of the psychic world. The two little ones sat on the ground, one with a warm expression and the other with a cold one, looking at Arix.\nEspecially since Sophia, who was usually so indifferent, said this, Arix felt even more touched.\n\"Thank you, Cupid, Sophia, Vita. I understand now. With you here, I won’t be afraid anymore.\" Seeing these adorable little ones, Arix’s heart felt warm.\nFeeling touched, Arix hugged the three little ones and rubbed her face against their fluffy cheeks.\nYes, she understood now. Since the past can’t be changed, she should cherish the present.\nMatis, Thaddeus, Fleur, Sister Gwen, Kellan, Cirilla... and Cupid and the others were her future. What more could she ask for?\nIf she let the past affect the future, Arix felt she would be letting someone down.\n’Hmm? Who is that SOMEONE?’\nArix suddenly felt like she had forgotten that \"someone,\" the one who seemed very important to her.\nBut no matter how hard she tried to remember, she could only think of an old man with a kind smile and lots of white beard.\nAlthough she couldn’t see his face clearly, she could tell he cared a lot about her.\n’Is it sims? He’s the only elder with a white beard I know.’\nBut, that couldn’t be right. She had only met Sims recently, yet this old man felt like someone she had known for a very long time, even longer than her parents from her past life.\n’How can I forget someone so important?’\nSince she couldn’t figure it out, Arix decided not to think about it. Maybe it was just her imagination.\nThe morning sun finally rose. As soon as she let Cupid and the others go back to her psychic world, her teammates came out of the cave, yawning.\nAfter washing up, everyone sat together with a bowl of soup, discussing their plans for the day.\n\"As long as we get points, I don’t care where we go,\" Dae-jung said, not minding.\n\"Anything is fine with me,\" Arix replied, being very easy-going about such things.\n\"We’ll follow the leaders,\" Calista and Femi agreed, having no opinions of their own.\nDrexel thought this team was too easy to lead, which made him feel a bit strangely disappointed. He finally spoke in a laid-back manner, \"Then let’s keep moving towards the inner area.\"\n\"Okay!\" Arix and the others agreed.\nAfter finishing breakfast, they saw it was still early, so they decided to wait a bit before setting out.\nTaking advantage of the free time, Arix asked Drexel about his psychic weapon from yesterday.\n\"I want to learn about how to materialize psychic weapons. Can you teach me how to do that?\" Arix had been interested in psychic weapons since yesterday and now remembered to ask.\n\"Call me ’respected brother,’ and I’ll teach you, and I’ll make sure you learn it well. How about that?\" Drexel put his arm around Arix’s shoulder and smiled mischievously.\nArix gave a cold laugh, took out a dagger, and with a sinister smile, asked, \"Will you teach me willingly now, or...?\"\n\"I was just joking to lighten the mood. Daggers are dangerous; you shouldn’t play with them. Be good and put it away, otherwise, it will get in the way when I teach you,\" Drexel’s mischievous smile froze, and he quickly tried to appease her.\n\"Hmph!\" Arix snorted coldly and put away the dagger.\nThen she gave Drexel a burning glare, her eyes seeming to say,\n’Why aren’t you starting already? What are you waiting for?’\nDae-jung and the others were also bored, so they decided to try learning too.\n\"Ahem, psychic weapons, as the name suggests, are weapons constructed from your psychic power. First, imagine what kind of weapon you want to have,\" Drexel explained gently and patiently.\n’A weapon I want?’\nArix thought for a moment and imagined the weapon she felt most comfortable using.\nSeeing his sister’s relaxed expression, Drexel guessed she had an idea and smiled, \"Now, open your palms and imagine it appearing there.\"\nArix nodded, focusing her psychic power on her palm. A sharp, cold weapon appeared in her hand.\nWhen Drexel saw Arix’s weapon, he laughed but quickly stopped himself. He tried to suppress his laughter, his face turning red.\nThe others also materialized their weapons: Calista had a bow and arrow, Femi had a chef’s knife slightly longer than a dagger, and Dae-jung had a heavy sword. But instead of focusing on their weapons, they all stared at Arix’s psychic weapon in surprise.\nArix’s hand held a delicate, small scalpel, making even a dagger look large and robust next to it.\n\"Pfft! Hahaha!!\" Drexel couldn’t hold back his laughter. He pointed at Arix, trying to say something, but he was laughing too hard to speak.\n\"Arix, it’s okay. Next time, we’ll make better weapons,\" Calista said, trying to comfort her friend.\n\"Yeah, yeah. It’s normal for the first time not to be perfect,\" Femi added, also trying to reassure her.\nDae-jung didn’t say anything, but he nodded along with Calista and Femi to show his support.\nArix remained calm. She held the scalpel and made a few slicing motions, her voice showing a hint of pleasure, \"Thanks, actually, it’s pretty good.\"\nIt could save lives and also take someone by surprise. For her, it was the perfect, versatile tool.",

      "content": "Chapter 88: A Dangerous Territory\nFor Arix, the scalpel was not only easy to use; also, it seemed it didn’t need to be sterilized for surgeries like the normal ones. It was a really great tool.\nArix thought she could try to create other surgical tools with her psychic powers someday.\nArix skillfully twirled the scalpel between her fingers, feeling more and more satisfied.\nCalista and the others saw Arix was happy with her creation and felt relieved. Then, they turned their attention to their own psychic weapons and began to play with them curiously.\nCalista studied her manifested bow for a while. She then created a long arrow and tried to shoot it. However, the arrow disappeared into thin air before it flew even half a meter.\nCalista wasn’t upset; instead, she repeated the process with excitement.\nAfter shooting about a dozen arrows, however, her head started to hurt, as if a rubber band was tied around it. This was a sign of her psychic power running out, so she stopped quickly to rest.\nFemi wanted to try chopping meat with his psychic weapon. But even though it looked sharp, it disappeared before touching the meat.\nAfter several tries, Femi began to doubt himself. Looking at the untouched meat, he could only keep trying with a frustrated expression.\nDae-jung was the strongest among the three. His heavy sword was not only large but also powerful, already able to leave deep cuts in the trees.\nThey all practiced for a long time until Drexel noticed it was getting late and called out, \"Time to move on!\"\nThe four of them nodded and then cleaned up their temporary camp.\nLater, they headed deeper into the forest in the formation they used yesterday. It seemed the beasts were still sleeping at this time, so they didn’t encounter any danger along the way.\nThey smoothly reached the border between the central and inner parts of the forest. There was a stone tablet blocking the path, with eight big letters on it: \"Celesterror Territory, No Entry.\"\nSeeing the sign only made Arix more curious about what was inside. The five of them exchanged glances, all understanding each other without a word.\n\"How about we go in and take a look?\" Arix suggested, her eyes sparkling. She had never seen a Celesterror before but heard they were very beautiful, which attracted many poachers.\nIn the Alliance, Celesterrors were protected animals, but in the Empire, they were incredibly rare and highly sought after at auctions. It was said that their prices could go over one billion astracredits for each.\n\"I think we should head in there. Our instructor never said we can’t enter Celesterror territory, so that’s basically allowed,\" Femi said with a sly grin.\n\"We’ll just take a quick look and come back. It should be fine,\" Calista added. She had only seen Celesterrors on the interstellarnet, so she was excited about the chance to see a real one.\nAs for Drexel and Dae-jung, they looked at each other, then shrugged. Seeing other people’s determination, he knew he had no choice now.\nOnce they made up their minds, the five of them crossed the stone tablet and entered the central area of The Sugli Forest, where the Celesterrors lived.\nAt the same time, in the meeting Room of the Sixth Warship...\nOrtiz held his forehead in frustration. He had been so proud moments ago, and now he felt utterly embarrassed. Disobedient students were common, but...\n’Do they really have to drag their instructor into their antics?’\n\"This is just great,\" Ortiz muttered.\nLaiden chuckled and looked at Marlone. \"Your niece is quite the troublemaker.\"\n\"Hmph! Not as much as yours!\" Marlone replied sarcastically, watching the footage from the nanobots. Poor Elio was being chased by a group of wild beasts, his fat jiggling with every step. Even Marlone felt exhausted just watching him.\nLaiden was instantly annoyed. Elio was his brother’s only son, and he wouldn’t tolerate anyone mocking him. Marlone felt the same way about Arix, the only daughter of the Kering family, cherished and protected.\nThe tension between Laiden and Marlone was palpable, an invisible battlefield filled with hostile glares and a tense atmosphere.\n\"Stop it. Something’s not right,\" Solis said suddenly, his eyes sharp as he watched the video. His tone was cold and serious.\nLaiden and Marlone were startled and immediately stopped bickering, looking at the video with concern.\n\"What do you mean, Solis?\" Marlone asked seriously.\nEveryone in the meeting room turned their attention to Solis, waiting anxiously for an explanation.\nThis test involved the heirs of five noble families and the students from the five military academies, so the exam had to be absolutely safe. Any mishap could have severe consequences, ones the Alliance couldn’t afford.\n\"Just now, our heirs, whether by accident or on purpose, all entered Celesterror territory. This can’t be a coincidence,\" Solis said, his voice filled with cold fury.\n\"Celesterrors would never let them enter like this. Normally, they would have been attacked by now. So, there can only be one explanation: the Celesterrors are facing a bigger problem!\" Marlone’s voice was cold as ice. He immediately used his opticomputer to contact the soldiers near the Celesterror territory to check the situation.\nThe soldiers received the orders and rushed towards the Celesterror territory without delay. However, before they could enter, an invisible barrier threw them back. Ignoring their injuries, they quickly reported this to Marlone and the others.\n\"Bang!\" Marlone slammed his fist on the table, his eyes filled with cold fury. \"This is a grand scheme!\"\nBefore the soldiers were thrown back, Marlone and the others saw what the barrier was. It was a massive psychic power shield, created by dozens of Supergiant-Class insectoids combining their psychic powers.\nEven more alarming was that these were just the insectoids on the surface. The situation inside the Celesterror territory was likely even more severe.\nThe examiners from the military academies didn’t waste a moment. They immediately sent a distress call to the Fifth Legion for assistance.\nAt this moment, in the Celesterror territory...\n\"Arix,\" Cupid’s voice sounded worried in Arix’s mind.\nArix was walking at that time. She stopped and quickly asked in her mind, \"Cupid, what’s wrong?\"\n\"Arix, do we have to stay in the forest? I feel something uncomfortable here,\" Cupid said anxiously.\n\"What makes you feel uncomfortable?\" Arix asked nervously.\n\"Bugs, a lot of bugs,\" Cupid, usually fearless, said with rare trembling and panic in his voice.\n\"Insects? Insectoids!\" Arix’s pupils contracted as she finally understood.\n\"Yes, it’s them,\" Cupid nodded frantically.\n\"Okay, I understand.\" Arix’s gaze turned sharp and cold.\nThen Arix directly tore off her digital bracelet, which immediately shocked Drexel and the others!\n\"Arix? What’s wrong?\" Calista was the first to express her confusion, not understanding why Arix suddenly chose to quit.\n\"Arix, you know that taking off the bracelet means quitting,\" Drexel didn’t ask why because he trusted his sister wouldn’t do something like this for no reason.\n\"Why hasn’t the instructors shown up since I took off the bracelet?\" Arix asked seriously.\nDrexel and the others finally realized what she was doing. They took off their bracelets, but after waiting for a long time, there was no sign of the instructor or anything at all.\n\"Did something happen to the instructors?\" Femi asked with wide, frightened eyes.\n\"I think something has happened to us. There might be a problem in this Celesterror territory,\" Drexel said with a serious expression, furrowing his brows.\n\"What should we do? Should we try to leave now?\" Calista asked, looking worriedly at everyone.\n\"If we could leave, the instructors would be able to come in. I’m afraid we are already trapped. We need to contact the outside world and find out what’s going on,\" Drexel said coldly.\n\"Is there any way to contact them?\" Arix asked Drexel, confused.\nThey didn’t have an opticomputer and couldn’t leave, so how could they contact anyone?\n\"There is a way,\" Drexel said. Then he took off his high boots and pulled out an opticomputer from his pants.\nArix’s eyes widened in surprise.\nDae-jung and the others were almost stunned.\n\"Pfft!\" Arix couldn’t help but laugh despite the serious teammates.\n\"Drexel, you smuggled an opticomputer into the competition? If the instructors find out, they might take you out and skin you alive in fury,\" Femi said, eyes wide with surprise.\nFemi silently prayed in his heart, hoping the instructors would go easy on Drexel after this was over.\nCalista looked at the opticomputer, then at Drexel, repeating this a few times before finally accepting the reality that, the honorable and upright Drexel might actually be a troublemaker.\n\"Let’s not worry about how the opticomputer got here. Look, it’s coming in handy now,\" Drexel said, coughing awkwardly to justify bringing the opticomputer.\n\"Enough talk, just use it already,\" Arix couldn’t listen any longer and interrupted Drexel’s awkward conversation.\nDrexel nodded, turned on the opticomputer, and called Marlone.",

      "content": "Chapter 89: Protecting An Egg\nThe next moment, Marlone’s anxious face appeared on the 3D virtual screen.\n\"Drexel! Arix! How are you? Are you safe?\" Marlone was surprised and worried to see his nephew calling.\n\"We’re fine for now,\" Arix’s image also appeared on the screen.\n\"We’re safe, but what’s going on? We seem to be trapped,\" Drexel asked, looking confused.\n\"The insectoids have surrounded the Celesterror territory. The Fifth Legion’s mecha team is on their way. Drexel, you must protect your sister and wait for rescue,\" Marlone instructed urgently.\n\"Okay. Also, please grant me access to the bracelet locations. I need to gather the students and protect them,\" Drexel said, revealing his other purpose.\n\"Alright, keep in touch,\" Marlone said before hanging up and sharing his instructor permissions with Drexel’s opticomputer.\nAs soon as Drexel received the permissions, he opened the digital bracelet location map. His face turned even grimmer.\nHe found out that the heirs of the five major families were all in Celesterror territory. The only good news was that there weren’t many other students.\n\"Arix, Dae-jung, Femi, Calista, I’ll go bring them here. You wait for me,\" Drexel said, considering everyone’s physical strength.\n\"Okay, be careful,\" Arix said, knowing her physical limitations, so she didn’t object.\nCalista and the others understood and nodded in agreement.\nAfter giving his instructions, Drexel disappeared without another word.\n\"Arix, will we be okay?\" Calista asked fearfully, holding onto Arix’s arm.\n\"Don’t worry, I’ll protect you,\" Arix reassured her, holding her arm.\nCalista’s eyes sparkled, her cheeks flushed, and she responded with a soft \"Mm-hmm.\"\n\"Arix, don’t forget about me! Please protect me too!\" Femi said tearfully.\nArix smiled and nodded, \"You’re my teammates, so of course I’ll protect you.\"\nDae-jung, confident in his abilities, didn’t panic like the others. He kept a cool face and watched the surroundings warily.\nBut Arix suddenly realized she had forgotten someone. She quickly turned to Dae-jung and said, \"Dae-jung, if you need it, I’ll protect you too.\"\nThen she turned back, still worriedly watching the spot where Drexel had left.\nDae-jung hadn’t understood at first, but when he did, he felt a warmth in his heart.\nThe feeling of being protected by a companion seemed quite nice.\nOn the other side, after Drexel left, the first person he encountered was Elio, who was being chased by a wild beast.\nElio looked miserable. His clothes were torn by branches, and he had many cuts on his face and body.\nThe worst part was that he had to run for his life. The beast chasing him was only half a meter away. If he slowed down even a little, he would be caught and killed.\nSo, when Elio saw Drexel, he shouted excitedly, \"Oh my god! Drexel! Help me!\"\nDrexel laughed at Elio’s pitiful appearance. Then he looked at the beast. He used his psychic power to create a long spear.\nDrexel pushed off with his toes and leaped towards the beast, which was about to bite Elio.\nAt the critical moment, Drexel used the spear to knock the beast away. Then he jumped up, held the spear with both hands, and came down like a meteor, piercing the beast’s skull.\nElio, who was sitting on the ground and panting heavily, raised his hand to give a thumbs up and said, \"Awesome, Drexel! That was cool!\"\nDrexel pulled the spear out of the beast and walked to Elio, helping him up. \"Why are you in Celesterror’s territory? Don’t tell me you were chased in by this bear.\"\n\"This is Celesterror territory?? I didn’t mean to come here. This damn bear chased me, and I don’t even know where I am.\" Elio kicked the bear’s corpse, feeling a bit relieved.\n’This unlucky guy, he always seemed to end up in trouble. Did he use up all his luck at birth?’\nDrexel sighed silently.\nThen he said, \"I still have things to do. I can’t explain much. In short, we are surrounded by insectoids and can’t leave the Celesterror territory. Go straight this way for 1 kilometer; Arix is there. Wait for me there. I need to find Cirilla, Varden, and others. I’m leaving now.\"\nAfter speaking, Drexel turned and left.\n\"Hey, wait! What do you mean we are surrounded by insectoids? Don’t joke about something so scary, okay?\" Elio was almost going crazy. He didn’t want to believe it was true.\nHe had just escaped from a beast, and now there were insectoids.\n’What was going on?’\nElio watched Drexel walk away, speechless.\nIn the end, he had to accept it and quickly ran in the direction Drexel had mentioned.\nMeanwhile, Arix and the others were not having an easy time either. After Drexel left, they encountered several waves of insectoids. Just after dealing with one wave, they heard more noises coming from the bushes.\nArix and Dae-jung exchanged a glance. Then they all looked cautiously at the bushes.\n\"Don’t be scared, it’s me!\" Elio said as he emerged from the bushes and saw them on high alert.\n\"Elio? Did you see Drexel?\" Arix asked worriedly.\n\"He went to find Varden and the others. He told me to come find you. Don’t worry, Drexel is strong; he’ll be fine,\" Elio reassured.\n\"Thanks,\" Arix said, though his eyes still looked worriedly in the direction Drexel had gone.\nAt that moment, Drexel found the last three people he was looking for.\n\"Cirilla, Zephyr, Varden, are you okay?\" Drexel asked, shocked at their miserable appearance.\nVarden and the others were covered in blood, looking like soldiers who had fought for days and nights, and barely won.\n\"Don’t look at us like you’re ready to bury us. This blood isn’t ours. And why are you here?\" Cirilla asked, holding a bright red egg.\n\"I came to find you. Let’s talk while we walk back; Arix is waiting for us,\" Drexel said, leading the way.\nWithout hesitation, Cirilla and the others followed Drexel back. On the way, Drexel briefly explained their situation.\nSeeing Cirilla carefully holding the egg, Drexel raised an eyebrow and joked, \"Cirilla, why are you carrying an egg? Are we having it for lunch?\"\nAs expected, Cirilla rolled her eyes at Drexel. \"This egg is the next Celesterror Lord. You can try eating it and see what happens.\"\n\"You mean this egg is the Celesterror King? How can it be so simple? An egg can become a Celesterror King?\" Drexel’s eyes widened in shock.\nHe knew the egg Cirilla was holding was special but didn’t expect it to be a Celesterror Lord’s egg!\n\"The Celesterror Lord’s mate entrusted it to us. Do you think it’s a joke?\" Cirilla said disdainfully.\n\"The Celesterror Lord’s mate entrusted it to you? What about the current Celesterror Lord? What happened to him and his family?\" Drexel asked, frowning in confusion.\n\"Sigh, it’s probably because of this egg. I heard it has a problem with its innate psychic power, so the Celesterror Lord went out with some Celesterrors to find medicine, giving the insectoids a chance to attack,\" Cirilla said, feeling sad as she held the egg more tightly.\n\"Sigh,\" Drexel said, feeling much more down after hearing this. He stopped talking and focused on hurrying towards Arix’s location.\nHe knew his sister was also in danger. Thinking about this made Drexel’s heart race even faster, and his eyes turned red with worry.\n’Arix! Wait for me!’\nhe thought, pushing himself to move even quicker.",

      "content": "Chapter 90: Meeting Quispe\nArix saw many students that Drexel had saved came to her.\nLuckily, the students seemed okay. They were not as scared as Arix had thought. Instead, they seemed like they were ready to face death.\n\"Arix, can we make it back home?\" asked the most seriously injured student. He looked at Arix weakly and spoke in a hopeless voice.\nThe student’s hopeless eyes felt like a sharp, cold knife stabbing into Arix’s tender heart.\nArix pushed down his sadness. He patted the student’s head and said, \"We will be out soon. The Fifth Legion has sent a mecha team to rescue us, so you must hold on, okay?\"\n\"Okay, I will hold on, I will...\" the student said. Then he closed his eyes and passed out.\nArix’s relaxed face turned serious after the student fainted. If the rescue didn’t come soon, this student wouldn’t make it. With severe internal bleeding and no medicine or special tools, even Arix couldn’t keep him alive much longer.\n’What should we do now?’\nArix frowned, feeling unsure for the first time.\n’What’s taken Drexel so long?’\nBefore she could check if Drexel had returned, Arix heard the students’ frightened screams.\n\"So many insectoids! Are we done for?\" The students, though prepared to perish here, felt scared seeing so many huge insectoids.\nThis time, the insectoids didn’t attack immediately. Instead, they seemed organized. This didn’t make Arix feel better; it made her eyes widen in fear. This meant a stronger insectoid had appeared.\nOrganized insectoids were much harder to deal with than those they had met before.\n\"Look! Why is there a person on the insectoid’s head?\" a student shouted, noticing something unusual.\nThe student’s voice made everyone curious. They all looked at the person.\n’Is that really a person?’\nA young man with blond hair and red eyes sat leisurely on the insectoid’s head. He looked incredibly handsome, with sharp features like a sculpture. His dark eyebrows and long, charming eyes were like a whirlpool, drawing everyone’s gaze inside. His high nose and perfectly shaped lips were now curved into a dazzling smile.\n\"I finally found my little lambs,\" the guy said with a strange, affectionate smile.\nWith his words, the air around became tense. Some knowledgeable students recognized the man immediately.\n\"Everyone, be careful! Don’t go near him, he’s an insectoid!\" A student who recognized his identity shouted in terror.\n\"But he looks human,\" another student said, confused.\n\"He is the insectoid crown prince. Only insectoid royalty can turn into humans. This means his psychic power and physical power are at least Supergiant+,\" the warning student explained as her voice trembled more and more, filled with despair.\n\"We’re doomed. We’ll never make it to the rescue.\"\n\"The insectoid crown prince is here. Do we even have a chance to survive?\"\n\"I haven’t even said goodbye to my family yet.\"\nListening to the students’ desperate words, Arix silently moved to the front. If they were going to die, she would protect these kids as long as possible.\nPrince Quispe looked at the student who had identified him, propping his chin up with his hand and giving an encouraging smile. \"I didn’t expect humans to be so smart. I even admire you a bit. As a reward, I grant you the honor of being food for my mount.\"\nThe student’s eyes filled with more fear, but remembering who she was now, she tried to stand calmly. She realized she was a military students, born to die with honor on the battlefield. Even if scared, she shouldn’t show weakness because she was the Alliance’s future soldier.\nTheir shaking legs wasn’t all fear; it was just a natural reaction.\n\"Boring. My people are hungry, so go to hell now,\" Quispe said, his voice devoid of any warmth. Then he waved his hand at the students. The insectoids, as if receiving a command, swarmed towards them.\nSeeing this, Arix quickly raised a psychic barrier, protecting all the students underneath it.\n\"Look, it’s Arix! She’s the first to stand up when there’s danger. It’s so inspiring.\"\n\"Yeah, she treated all the injured ones just now, and now she is fighting to protect us. Let’s not give up! Come on!\"\n\"Yes! Even if we die, we should take an insectoid down with us!\"\nQuispe watched the resisting students for a moment with interest. Then, he turned his gaze to the source of it all—a young woman, with sheer psychic power, held up a strong psychic barrier, resisting the entire insectoid attack.\nThe young woman was about the same age as him. Her skin was as smooth as silk, and her eyes were pure and endless, like the color of the clearest sky. Her cheekbones were so cute, and her black hair had natural waves and curves that made Quispe imagine the feel of it under his fingers.\nQuispe’s eyes lit up as if he had found a toy he liked, his smile charming but twisted. He jumped down from his mount and walked elegantly toward Arix.\nHis blood-red eyes, slightly aggressive, stared at her for a moment. And then, his smile grew more satisfied, yet more dangerous too.\n\"You are powerful, and I respect strength. So I will make you my mate. This is my gift to a worthy opponent,\" Quispe said, looking at Arix like a noble god, both caring and disdainful.\nArix thought to herself,\n’Who let this lunatic out? Someone please take him back immediately!’\n\"Woman, your look displeases me. You’ll be punished,\" Quispe said. Then, with a snap of his fingers, he shattered Arix’s mental barrier.\n’What the heck?’\nArix’s pupils tightened. She looked at her hands in disbelief.\nHer Supergiant+ psychic power had never been so thoroughly crushed before.\n’So, just how terrifying is the power of this young man in front of me?’\n\"Your look finally pleases me,\" Quispe said with a contemptuous smile. He continued, \"Although your psychic power is impressive, your physical power holds it back. If you agree to be my mate, I’ll help you raise your physical power to Supergiant. How about that?\"\n\"Sorry, not interested. I don’t like bugs,\" Arix said, looking at Quispe with disgust.\nEven though he was good-looking, it didn’t change the fact that he was a bug under a human shell.\nArix’s words and look completely angered Quispe. His red eyes narrowed, and he said coldly, \"If you don’t want to be my mate willingly, then I’ll have to erase your memory and make you a puppet.\"\nArix felt completely at loss. She wanted to question God in face, asking why He sent such an overdramatic young man, trying to kill her with cringe.\nArix rubbed the goosebumps on her arms and glanced at her friends.\nShe saw them defending and attacking, not panicking even though the psychic barrier had disappeared.\nThe weight in Arix’s heart finally lifted. She breathed a sigh of relief and stared hard at Quispe. Then she clenched her fists, ready to move.\nQuispe looked at the young woman’s angry eyes. This time, instead of getting angry, he became more interested in her.\nSure enough, having her lively like this was more to his liking than making her a puppet.\nArix didn’t waste any more words. She grabbed a dagger and rushed at Quispe. She attacked him several times but never touched him.\nSupergiant physical power wasn’t just a number; his speed, strength, and endurance were far beyond Arix’s.",

Her main goal was to buy time and wait for help.\nIf the young man in front of her got serious, Arix felt she had no chance of winning.\nIt wasn’t that Arix was too weak; it was that this young man was too strong—not just in physical power, but in psychic power too. Arix had no confidence in defeating him!\nQuispe also saw through Arix’s plan, but he wasn’t in a hurry. It was like a cat playing with a mouse before eating it, watching it struggle in despair before slowly devouring it.\nPrey tasted better that way.\nJust as Quispe was having fun, another young man appeared next to him.\n\"Quispe, what are you doing? If you don’t kill them quickly, the Alliance’s army will arrive,\" a young man said angrily. He had the same eyes as Quispe’s, yet his hair was blue.\n\"I don’t need you to tell me what to do, Hardy,\" Quispe said, clearly annoyed. He despised Hardy even more than these prey he wanted to kill.\n\"Hmph!\" Hardy, just an ordinary insectoid prince, didn’t dare to argue with Quispe, the crown prince. Instead, he directed his anger at Arix.\nQuispe didn’t stop him but watched with interest.\nHardy attacked Arix directly. Using his psychic power, he slammed her to the ground. Then, his hands turned into sharp spikes, aiming to stab Arix.\nArix rolled away awkwardly, dodging the spikes. Before she could catch her breath, Hardy attacked again.\n\"Arix, let’s help you,\" Cupid said in the psychic world, feeling worried.\n\"No, wait. It’s not time yet,\" Arix refused. This young man, though tough, wasn’t as terrifying as Quispe.\nFrom the very start, Arix was only wary of Quispe. He was incredibly strong and unpredictable, like a mad dog ready to attack at any moment.\nRight now, Quispe was playing with her, treating her like a toy. If Cupid and the others revealed themselves, Quispe would likely kill them instantly, and Arix couldn’t stop him.\nSo, unless it was absolutely necessary, Arix couldn’t reveal Cupid and the others.\n\"Hardy, don’t kill her. She’s my new toy,\" Quispe warned casually.\nHardy laughed coldly and hit even harder. Soon, Arix was covered in wounds. She ended up lying on the ground, spitting blood.\nThe students watching wanted to help Arix, but the other insectoids stopped them.\n\"Arix, don’t worry about us. Just go,\" the helpless students cried.\nThey knew Arix could escape alone. She stayed to buy them time. But watching her get hurt was worse than getting physically tortured for them.\n\"Arix, leave! We don’t need you to save us,\" the students shouted.\n\"Arix, save yourself. Go!\" Calista cried the loudest.\nElio cried and fought the insectoids, cursing them with every bad word he knew.\nDae-jung didn’t shout, but his hands were bloody from gripping his dagger too tightly, eyes filled with anger at the scene.\nHardy, hearing the desperate cries, became even more vicious, like he was fueled by their misery.\nAfter Arix was kicked away again, Quispe finally said coldly, \"Enough. If she dies, so do you.\"\nHardy reluctantly stopped, giving a final angry huff before standing still.\nQuispe saw that Hardy had calmed down, so he took back his murderous glare. Then he looked at Arix, who was lying on the ground and unable to move.\nQuispe walked over to Arix. He squatted down and grabbed her bruised and bleeding cheek. He asked again, \"Will you be my mate now? If you agree, I can do something for you, like kill the person who just abused you.\"\nArix forced a smile, looking at Quispe with a cold expression. \"No way!\"\nQuispe laughed angrily, his red eyes both charming and dangerous. He smirked and said, \"Whether it’s possible or not is not up to you. You should at least accept the opportunity and have a try, how do you know you won’t like it without having a taste?\"\nArix felt disgusted and turned her head, not wanting to see him anymore.\nQuispe thought her silence meant she had accepted her fate, so he stood up, satisfied.\nHe snapped his fingers.\nA transparent, spherical psychic power barrier surrounded Arix on the ground. Then, she floated beside Quispe.\nArix didn’t resist. Sitting quietly in the barrier, she wiped the blood from her mouth.\nSeeing Arix so obedient pleased Quispe even more. He took out a Star-Class healing potion from his Space Button and threw it to her.\n\"Take care of your injuries first. After I kill these weaklings, I’ll take you back to our insectoid Empire,\" Quispe said softly, but his words were cruel.\nArix clenched her fists, suppressing her anger. She took the potion, opened it, checked it, and then gulped it down.\nNow was not the time to be picky. Drinking the potion might give her a better chance to fight back.\n\"Cupid, Vita, Sophia, are you ready?\" Arix silently asked.\n\"Yes!\" The three little ones nodded seriously, concentrating.\nWith their combined psychic power, Arix finally manifested a real psychic weapon in her hand.\nShe shattered the psychic power barrier trapping her and, before Quispe could react, used all her strength to stab a scalpel into his heart.\nBut Quispe, who should have died, showed no sign of injury. Instead, he used his psychic power to throw Arix forcefully away.\n’Impossible. How could this happen?’\nArix spat out blood, looking at Quispe in shock. She couldn’t understand why he wasn’t dead.\nQuispe sneered and used his psychic power to bind Arix, lifting her into the air in front of him.\n\"Are you curious why I didn’t die?\" Quispe drank a healing potion slowly, without any anger in his voice.\nIt was like a human being scratched by a cat or dog—would they get angry at the pet? Pets are so cute, of course they would forgive them. Quispe felt the same way, or maybe he was just a pervert. The more his \"pet\" resisted, the more excited he became.\nArix watched in horror as the wound she had inflicted with all her strength healed right before her eyes. She finally broke down a bit, glaring at Quispe and asking for the first time, \"So, why aren’t you dead?\"\nQuispe laughed loudly.\nWhen he finally stopped, he touched Arix’s cheek gently and said with pity in his voice, \"Woman, your name is Arix, right? You are adorably foolish. With our level of psychic power, unless you can completely destroy all of it at once, you can’t kill us physically. If there is a real weak spot, it should be here.\"\nQuispe pointed to his head with his slender finger.\nArix was speechless. Now she understood. Unless she killed him in one blow, he could heal from any injury quickly. But to kill him in one blow, she would have to destroy his psychic power. That seemed impossible.\nArix also had Supergiant+ psychic power, but her Star-Class physical body limited her strength. If she used her full psychic power, her body would be the first to break down.\nSo, she destroying Quispe’s psychic power was nearly impossible. She realized that if she had aimed for his head earlier, she might have at least severely injured him, even if he didn’t die.\nThinking about the missed opportunity, Arix felt a pang of regret. \"How about I try again? This time, I promise to aim for your head?\" she asked, trying to negotiate. Maybe this crazy insectoid man would foolishly agree.\nQuispe laughed even harder, clutching his forehead.\n\"Arix, you are too adorable. I’m finding it harder and harder to want to kill you,\" Quispe said tenderly, touching the corner of Arix’s eye. His eyes were full of mad obsession.\nArix’s mouth twitched, and she was about to retort when she heard an enraged shout.\n\"Bastard, let go of my sister!\" Drexel yelled, his heart breaking at the sight of his injured and tormented sister.\nAt that moment, Drexel lost all reason. He charged at Quispe like a madman, gripping his spear.\nQuispe snorted and snapped his fingers, creating a psychic power shield that blocked Drexel’s attack. But to his surprise, the shield shattered the next moment.\nEven Quispe looked at Drexel with a puzzled expression. \"Another Supergiant+? No, you’re not. Then how did you break my psychic power shield?\"\n\"Shut up! You dare to mistreat my sister? I’ll crush you!\" Drexel roared in fury.\nSeeing Arix’s terrible condition had pushed his anger to its limit. Each strike he aimed at Quispe carried terrifying power, as if a god of war had descended.",

      "content": "Chapter 92: Black Hole\nUnder Drexel’s relentless assault, even Quispe began to falter. With Arix by his side, he couldn’t unleash his full strength. Reluctantly, Quispe tossed Arix toward Hardy and ordered, \"Take care of her.\"\nFreed from worry, Quispe dove back into the intense battle with Drexel.\nHardy caught Arix, a sinister smile curling on his lips. Glancing at Quispe, who was locked in combat, he murmured, \"Alright, my dear CROWN prince.\"\nArix noticed Hardy’s scheming look and felt a wave of dread.\n\"You’re Arix, right?\" Hardy sneered.\n\"No, I’m not,\" Arix denied, shaking her head. \"I’m Alexandra. Call me Alex.\"\n\"Ha! So many people just called you Arix. Do you think I’m deaf? It doesn’t matter if you are or not; today, you’re going to die anyway. This is a death order from the insectoid queen. You should feel honored.\" Hardy pulled out a strange crystal and threw it on the ground, creating a terrifying vortex instantly.\n’A black hole? A real black hole that will reduce someone to nothing?’\nArix’s eyes widened in fear. She wanted to call for help, but before she could, Hardy clamped his hand over her mouth.\nShe struggled, yet her muffled cries going unnoticed.\nDae-jung, who had been trying to rescue Arix, was the first to notice something was wrong. He shouted, \"Arix is in danger! Save her, quick!\"\nBoth fighters halted, their eyes darting toward Arix.\n\"You damn bug! Let go of my sister!\" Drexel was furious, itching to tear Hardy apart. But with Arix in Hardy’s grip, he dared not act recklessly.\n\"Hardy! Stop! I’ll crush you if you hurt her a bit!\" Quispe saw the black hole and immediately understood Hardy’s plan.\nBlack holes were different from wormholes. Wormholes, though a kind of black holes, had established space passages built by the insectoids, making them safer. A black hole, however, was an undeveloped wormhole. Falling into it meant getting lost in the universe, and the space storms inside could shred a person to pieces, turning them into cosmic debris.\n\"Quispe, this is our mission! Don’t forget HER orders: extinguish the Alliance’s last hope. This woman is Arix Kering! Are you going to stop me now?\" Hardy frowned, displeased, glaring at Quispe.\nThinking of the terrifying queen, Quispe’s eyes narrowed. But seeing Arix struggle, he couldn’t bear it. \"Hand her over to me. I’ll take care of it myself.\"\nHardy hesitated, annoyed.\n’Why haven’t I realized Quispe is such a lovesick fool before? If I had known, he wouldn’t have teamed up with him.’\nQuispe was turning out to be a real liability.\nHardy, disgusted, stopped wasting time and prepared to shove Arix directly into the black hole.\nLuckily, Cupid, Vita, and Sophia arrived just in time, knocking Hardy away in unison.\nArix, still bound, barely had time to breathe a sigh of relief before another insectoid appeared out of nowhere and crashed into her, sending her into the black hole.\nArix got desperate.\n’So, dying today seems inevitable, huh?’\nAs Arix lost her balance, she managed a bitter smile. Just before being swallowed by the black hole, she thought she saw Cassian arriving with the Alliance forces. Yet, before she could be sure, the black hole engulfed her completely.\n\"Arix!!!\" The three little ones screamed in terror, then, without hesitation, they jumped in after her.\n\"Arix!!!\"\n\"Arix!!!\"\nTheir heart-wrenching cries echoed through The Sugli Forest. Drexel, Dae-jung, Calista, Cirilla, Elio, and countless other students frantically lunged toward the black hole, trying to pull Arix back.\nBut the black hole closed the instant Arix fell in, as if it had completed its mission. No matter how quickly they moved, there was no chance to retrieve her once she was inside.\n\"Argh—\" Drexel roared in agony, unable to believe this was happening. A black hole! There was no hope of surviving that!\nHis sister, who had just returned home...\n’How am I losing her again? And this time, the odds of her surviving are so slim. Can I ever get her back?’\nDriven mad, Drexel began furiously digging at the spot where the black hole had been, desperate to find it and follow Arix inside. He couldn’t bear thinking his gentle, kind sister alone in that dark, cold void.\nCassian, who had just arrived, stared in disbelief at the scene, his fury breaking through his rationality. He transformed instantly into a massive white werewolf, baring his fangs at the two insectoids. His huge golden eyes, once calm, now blazed with a murderous rage, fixed on Hardy.\nCassian raised his wolf head and let out an enraged howl. His enormous body did nothing to hinder his speed; instead, he moved like lightning toward Hardy.\nTerrified, Hardy hastily put up a psychic power barrier, but no barrier, no matter how strong, could withstand absolute power. It shattered like glass under Cassian’s attack.\n\"Quispe! What are you standing there for? Save me!\" Hardy, overwhelmed by Cassian’s terrifying presence, called out to his teammate for help.\nQuispe, watching coldly from the side, also wanted to kill Hardy. But as an insectoid prince, Hardy’s death wasn’t something he could decide, no matter how much he deserved it.\nQuispe raised a Supergiant+ psychic barrier to withstand Cassian’s attack. He then turned to Hardy, expressing his disgust. \"Open a space portal and get us out of here now, do you really want to die here?\"\n\"Fine.\" Hardy quickly took out a special crystal and crushed it. Instantly, a vortex resembling a black hole appeared beside them.\n\"Go!\" Quispe commanded, grabbing Hardy and stepping into the vortex, disappearing from sight.\nCassian could only watch helplessly as the two insectoids responsible for Arix’s demise vanished. Overwhelmed with fury, he spat out a mouthful of blood and instantly reverted to his small white wolf form, plummeting from the air.\nDuke Glendale arrived just a bit too late. Catching Cassian with urgency, he let out a helpless sigh and said, \"Oh boy, Your Highness! You’re not even healed yet, and here you are in another fight. How am I going to explain this to His Majesty when you return half-dead?\"\n\"Save her...\" Cassian managed to whisper before slipping into unconsciousness.\n\"Alright, alright, save her. Got it. You just rest now. Finding someone who fell into a wormhole? That’s right up my alley,\" Duke Glendale replied, rolling his eyes as he thought of something.\nCassian wanted to say more, but his severe injuries rendered him completely unconscious. The wounds from his last wormhole incident had never fully healed, and using his psychic powers twice in the past month had worsened his condition greatly.\nHolding the small wolf cub, Duke Glendale sighed and remarked, \"They say deep love shortens one’s life. You lovers sure know how to wear yourselves out.\"\n\"Your Grace, we’ve wrapped things up with the Alliance. Should we head back to the Empire now?\" Kasem, the butler, asked respectfully.\n\"Back to the Empire? Not a chance! Kasem, look at this little wolf cub. He risked his life twice for the Alliance. We can’t return empty-handed; that would be a huge loss,\" Duke Glendale said, looking at Kasem like he was a fool.\nKasem, caught off guard by the Duke’s shamelessness, quickly shifted to an expression of admiration. \"As expected, Your Grace, always so wise.\"\nWith a satisfied smirk, Duke Glendale, carrying the wolf cub, started walking towards the edge of the forest, muttering, \"I’ve heard the Alliance recently developed a psychic power healing potion. We can’t miss out on that. Let’s go check it out.\"\n\"Yes, Your Grace,\" Kasem replied.\nThe joint training competition of the five military academies was cut short due to an insectoid invasion. This incident left one student missing and dozens severely injured. Fortunately, the advanced medical technology of the interstellar era saved the injured students.\nDespite these efforts, there was no joy among the students or instructors. The missing student, Arix, was still unaccounted for, and hopes of finding them alive were slim.\nThe second greatest victim in this ordeal was probably Arix’s brother, Drexel, who had to return home for mandatory rest due to his mental state. He’d be home until the Hecaris Military Academy reopened.",

      "content": "Chapter 93: Two Arixes\nThe training base was shrouded in gloom.\nAt the emergency meeting called by the Alliance President, the expressions of the five Admirals were grim.\n\"As is customary, whenever a hero of the Alliance sacrifices their life, the Memorial Hall will officially publish their life experiences and achievements. We are holding this meeting to ask everyone whether we should announce Arix’s story,\" Zeta asked, breaking the heavy silence as he looked at the five somber admirals.\n\"It doesn’t matter to me,\" Matis responded. His usual vigor was gone, his silver hair more pronounced. Since learning his granddaughter had fallen into the black hole, Matis seemed to have aged years overnight.\n\"Announce it. There are a lot of rumors on the interstellarnet. It’s time to clear Arix’s name,\" Mael, holding traditional views, emphasized the importance of reputation.\n\"Those who spread rumors should be sentenced or at least, fined. Charge them with insulting a military martyr,\" Fane said coldly. Slandering military martyrs is a severe crime in the Alliance. That suggestion showed how much Fane cherished Arix.\n\"I also suggest that the military file lawsuits against these people to hold them legally accountable. These individuals enjoy the peace brought by others’ sacrifices yet fail to appreciate it. Many of them hide in dark corners, judging others with the darkest of worldviews,\" Sykes added, clearly displeased.\n\"Huh, they think they can escape by hiding in dark corners. I’ve already gathered their information. Zeta, it’s up to you now,\" Virek said, handing over a thick stack of documents to Zeta.\nZeta skimmed through the documents, his eyes sharp. \"I’ll discuss with the judicial department on how to deal with these irresponsible people,\" he declared. The five admirals trusted Zeta; with him taking action, these rumor-mongers would at least face severe consequences.\nAfter the meeting, the Alliance released three headlines on the interstellar net.\nThe first headline announced that any future comments insulting martyrs or soldiers could be subject to legal action. This was well-received by the people of the Alliance.\nSome accounts continued to make jokes about Arix’s sacrifice, but investigations revealed that these account holders were not from the Alliance. Most people simply laughed it off and moved on.\nThe second headline detailed Arix’s life and contributions to the Alliance. It was then that people discovered that Drexel and Arix, whom they had shipped as a couple, were actually siblings. This revelation shocked many fans who had supported the pair, leaving them in disbelief.\nSoon, sharp-eyed netizens noticed that Arix was also the researcher behind the psychic power healing potion.\nHowever, before everyone could fully celebrate the revelation of Arix as a potion genius, the third interstellarnet headline dropped: \"Yesterday, in the Sugli Forest, Arix sacrificed herself to save numerous classmates from an insectoid massacre. She delayed the attackers long enough for others to escape but ultimately fell into a black hole and are now tragically missing.\"\nFalling into a black hole was effectively a death sentence.\nIn the entire history of the Alliance, no one who had fallen into a black hole had ever returned alive.\nRealizing this, those people, who had been following the story, felt as if they had been struck by a thunderbolt.\nUpon seeing the final headline, many people couldn’t hold back their tears. After almost crying their eyes out, a large number of Alliance citizens spontaneously went to the guarded outskirts of the Sugli Forest to lay flowers for Arix.\nThe compassionate people of the Alliance used these flowers to express their tribute and sorrow for the martyr Arix.\nChapter 105 Two Arixes\nWhile the world outside mourned the loss of Arix, inside the black hole, a young woman was busy giving Arix a piece of her mind.\n\"Hey, Raya! How long are you going to sleep? I don’t have much time left!\" an irate female voice echoed.\nArix groggily opened her eyes to see her past life’s face, clearly upset. Still dazed, Arix stared blankly for a few seconds before letting out a piercing scream that echoed through the black hole.\n\"What the hell? Where am I? Help!\" Arix shouted, trying to run but finding herself unable to move. She was trapped in a transparent spherical barrier, forced to watch her past self slowly approach.\nCupid, equally confused, joined in the screaming and attempted to flee, while Vita and Sophia remained calmly squatting in place.\n\"Don’t come any closer! I’m warning you, come any closer and I’ll fight back!\" Arix yelled, on the verge of a breakdown.\n\"Raya, are you out of your mind? You’ve been in my body for so many years, and you’re still this scared of me?\" \"Arix\" looked at her with disdain, her tone full of irritation.\n\"What are you talking about? When was I in your body for ten years?\" Arix’s eyes widened with fear, tears welling up as she hugged Cupid. Both human and tiger looked pathetically innocent, as if the young woman before them was some kind of villain, and they were her persecuted victims.\n\"Hah!\" \"Arix\" scoffed, pointing to her own face. \"I’m Arix, got it?\"\n\"Got it!\" Arix and Cupid nodded fearfully, but Arix quickly realized something was off and shook her head. \"Wait, no, I’m the real Arix. Have I missed my past life so much that I’ve developed a split personality?\"\n\"Arix\" closed her eyes in exasperation and took a deep breath. Then, she delivered a swift blow to Arix’s head, shouting, \"You are Raya Kering, and I am Arix Vetti! Got it now? If not, I’ll fix that for you.\"\n\"Ouch, ouch, ouch!!\" Arix cried, clutching her head where a lump had formed. She squatted down, looking pitifully at \"Arix\". But seeing her angry eyes, Arix quickly nodded, still tearful. \"Got it, I got it. But why have we switched places? And how are we seeing each other now?\"\nArix’s question actually stumped \"Arix\", who wasn’t quite sure either. Seeing \"Arix\" momentarily quieted down, Arix sighed in relief. She quickly scooped up Vita and Sophia, asking with concern, \"Vita, Sophia, are you two okay?\"\n\"We’re fine,\" Vita and Sophia reassured her, shaking their heads adorably as they nestled in Arix’s arms. Then, glancing at the other \"Arix\", they whispered, \"Arix, she doesn’t seem like a bad person. It looks like she means no harm to you. And, we might have been saved because of her.\"\nArix looked curiously at the young woman before her and then finally took in her surroundings. They were still inside the black hole, but the spherical barrier seemed to be keeping them safe. This odd barrier could only have been created by the other \"Arix\".\nFeeling a bit embarrassed, Arix cleared her throat. It felt awkward saying her own name out loud like that. Meanwhile, the other \"Arix\", having gathered her thoughts, asked seriously, \"Did you receive incomplete memories? How could you forget that you are Raya?\"\nArix was taken aback. She indeed had no memories from before she was five. She had always assumed it was a normal part of growing up. But now that the other \"Arix\" mentioned it, something seemed off.\n’If I was really Raya and had changed my name, how could I not remember something so big?’\nMoreover, what the other \"Arix\" said couldn’t be a lie. The girl standing before her was in her psychic incarnation form, and she looked exactly like her past self, which means she was the original owner of the Arix Vetti body.\nPsychic Incarnations reflected one’s soul, and while physical appearances could be faked, the soul’s appearance could not.\nDespite the strangeness of the situation, Arix found it oddly natural. Then, another question arose: If she really was the interstellar Raya, why had she traveled to the modern world and lost these memories?\n\"I really don’t have any memories from before I was five. So, I’ve always thought I WAS Arix Vetti. Do you remember how you ended up in the interstellar era?\" Arix asked, her curiosity piqued.\nThe other Arix’s expression grew serious as she pinched her chin, thinking for a moment before replying, \"I don’t know why it happened. One day, I suddenly found myself in the interstellar era, waking up in your body, a girl that was younger than me. I was afraid your family would notice something was off. Also, there was a maid who tried to kidnap me, so I let her take me. Once I was out of the Kering family, I knocked her out and hid in a garbage transport ship to escape.\"\n\"Wait, wait, hold on. You let her kidnap you on purpose?\" Arix was stunned. She hadn’t expected such a bold move from the other \"Arix\". A normal person’s reaction would be just to pretend to have amnesia or lay low for a while.\nThe other \"Arix\" gave Arix a stare. After getting back to the modern world and absorbing Arix’s memories of the time when she was absent, she couldn’t help comparing their lives. Seeing Arix’s life, surrounded by love, and then looking at her own, where she had to scavenge through garbage to survive, \"Arix\" did feel some regret, and jealousy.\nHowever, the interstellar era was different from the modern age, especially with the added complication of psychic powers. Arix’s own psychic power was so low it was embarrassing. If she were to have her psychic power tested, it would be game over. So, leaving the Kering family might not have been the worst thing.\nWith this in mind, \"Arix\" found peace with her situation. Despite scavenging on Planet Waste for ten years, she had ultimately gained something valuable. She hated studying chemistry, but after the switch, she not only had all of Arix’s chemistry knowledge but also a natural aptitude for it.\nIt was like suddenly acquiring a magical medical cheat code—an undeniably thrilling advantage.",

      "content": "Chapter 94: Gene Lock\nDuring the ten more years she had stayed in the interstellar era, \"Arix\" has gained a lot of knowledge about mecha technology. After returning, she wasted no time in setting up her own arms company.\nToday, she’s a renowned mecha expert in the 21st-century world. When she steps out, she’s always flanked by more than a dozen guards for protection.\nWith her ambition, building a spaceship and migrating to other planets might soon be within reach. It’s possible that the next leap in interstellar travel could be driven by her innovations.\n...\nRealizing her time here was limited, \"Arix\" quickly moved to the main task.\n\"Raya, I don’t have much time. This time, I’m here on an old man’s orders,\" \"Arix\" began, cutting Raya off before she could ask, \"I don’t know who he is, so don’t ask.\"\nRaya felt a strange sense of familiarity, as if \"Arix\" could read her mind. She hadn’t even asked yet, but the answer was already given.\n\"Alright, then at least tell me what he sent you here to do,\" Raya said, resigned and curious.\n\"To unlock your gene lock,\" \"Arix\" replied with a serious tone.\n\"Gene lock? Isn’t that for treating genetic diseases? I haven’t noticed any gene lock in me,\" Raya said, completely baffled. She even used her psychic power to scan herself again but found nothing.\nGene locks are typically used to manage DNA fusion issues arising from hereditary problems or other reasons. Usually, only those with close-relative marriages or problematic parental combinations, like ligers, would have their genes specifically locked.\nIf an ordinary person locked their genes for no reason, at best, they might not grow tall, go bald, have a flat chest, or be short. At worst, they’d be prone to cancer and hereditary diseases.\nEven in the 21st century, modifying a baby’s genes is strictly prohibited, let alone in the interstellar era.\nRaya shook her head in confusion, sayhing, \"Why don’t we just try unlocking it first? Maybe something will come to you.\"\n\"Alright,\" \"Arix\" agreed, though reluctantly.\n\"And Cupid, Vita, Sophia, you should return to my psychic world for now. We’re about to start,\" Raya said, her expression softening as she addressed the three little ones in her arms.\n\"Okay,\" they replied in unison. Then they transformed into streams of psychic power and returned to Raya’s psychic world.\nOnce everything was set, \"Arix\" gently cupped Raya’s face and pressed their foreheads together.\n\"Isn’t this a bit unscientific? Gene locks aren’t supposed to be opened like this,\" Arix mumbled, feeling the warmth on her forehead and suddenly feeling awkward.\n\"Shut up! You’ve already time-traveled, and you’re still talking to me about science?\" \"Arix\" snapped, a symbol of irritation flashing on her forehead.\nFeeling helpless, Raya closed her mouth, then her eyes, and waited quietly.\nAfter a short while, a blinding white light suddenly burst forth from between the foreheads of the two young women.\nArix felt as if her entire body was ablaze, something within her breaking free from a cage. She opened her eyes in agony and saw that \"Arix\" was gradually becoming transparent.\n\"What’s happening to you?\" Arix asked, her concern cutting through the pain.\n\"It’s nothing, just my time running out. It’s time to say goodbye,\" \"Arix\" said with a calm smile, as if she had anticipated this moment.\nWhile \"Arix\" seemed serene, Arix was filled with reluctance. The pain in her body intensified, making her throat so raw that she couldn’t even speak. She could only reach out weakly, trying to grasp \"Arix.\"\n\"Arix\" spoke in a proud yet slightly playful tone, \"Raya, I always thought my time-traveling was just an accident. But on the night I died, a mysterious elder appeared next to my corpse—or rather, your corpse. I couldn’t see his face clearly, but he seemed to be praying for a long time. Then, your soul returned to this body. After that, I don’t know what happened. He only instructed me to unlock the gene lock in your body if I ever returned to the interstellar era. After that, he sent me back to the present. Although that old man was a bit aloof, I’m still grateful to him.\"\nHearing this, Arix felt a mix of emotions. But at that moment, she didn’t care about any old man. She only knew that this newfound friend was about to leave before they had even gotten to know each other well.\n\"Arix\" reached out, wanting to ruffle Arix’s hair one last time, but her hand couldn’t make it. \"And thank you for taking care of Sister Gwen and the others. Although we just met and now have to say goodbye, I want to say, Arix, it’s been a pleasure meeting you.\"\n\"Arix\" then disintegrated into fragments, like data being deleted, and vanished completely.\nTears streamed down Arix’s face, the pain and sadness indistinguishable. With a hoarse voice, she whispered to the empty space where \"Arix\" had been, \"It was a pleasure meeting you too.\"\nArix then could no longer withstand the excruciating pain and fainted. In the end, within the dark and perilous void, only a transparent light sphere enveloped Arix, directionless and uncertain of where it would go next.\nAt this moment, within the Empire...\nInside the grand and sacred Moon Goddess Temple, an elderly man, dressed in the Pontifex’s attire—a white robe trimmed with gold—sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion. He was deep in prayer before the massive statue of the Moon Goddess.\nPerhaps because he had devoted his entire life to faith, the old man seemed to emanate a divine aura. His appearance was kind and wise, yet his eyes betrayed a cold indifference toward the world.\nHowever, the moment Raya’s gene lock was unlocked, the Pontifex’s prayer abruptly halted. He slowly opened his eyes, and a hint of emotion finally appeared in his gaze.\n\"Moon Goddess, should I intervene?\" Vezgor murmured, his expression complex.\nYears ago, for the sake of his granddaughter—his daughter’s daughter—he had broken his own rules and altered her fate of certain death. Now, his granddaughter was once again in peril, trapped in a dangerous black hole. His rational mind told him to remain uninvolved.\nBut the anxious beating of his heart mocked his self-deception.\nFor the first time, the Pontifex, who usually felt at peace, was unsettled. He closed his eyes and prayed again. It seemed as though he received some sort of message, and his expression relaxed.\n\"Thank you, Moon Goddess. I understand.\" The Pontifex closed his eyes once more and resumed his prayer, now with a heart free of distractions.\nIn a hidden forest of the Empire, a beautiful meteor streaked across the early morning sky.\nMama Tiger, who was crouched down to drink water, lifted her head. Her eyes sparkled with curiosity as she watched the meteor glide by.\nAfter the meteor had vanished, Mama Tiger drank her fill. Then she picked up the wild rabbit she had caught earlier and started heading back to her den.\nShe wondered if her cubs were hungry since she had been out hunting longer than usual.\nUpon returning to the cave, Mama Tiger checked the entrance, covered with grass and stones. She felt relieved seeing that neither humans nor animals had disturbed it.\nUsing her paws, she moved aside the grass and stones, then squeezed through the small entrance.\nInside the spacious cave, Mama Tiger shook out her fur. She carried the prey to her cubs’ nest.\nSeeing her cubs still asleep, Mama Tiger’s heart softened. She let out a gentle growl to wake them for breakfast.\nBefore dividing the food, Mama Tiger habitually counted her cubs.\nOne cub, two cubs, three cubs, four cubs, five cubs...\n’Wait a minute. There’s an extra cub today.’\nMama Tiger nodded happily but then suddenly froze.\nThere was an extra one!\nONE EXTRA!\nEXTRA!\nThe prey dropped from her mouth in shock. She instinctively used her furry paws to clutch her face in horror. Her powerful jaw, which had taken many lives, was now dropping and silently screaming.\nHer expression resembled Edvard Munch’s famous painting, \"The Scream.\"\nAfter a moment, Mama Tiger snapped out of it and counted again. The result was still the same—one extra cub.\nHer expression grew serious. She bent down and carefully inspected the cubs in the nest.\nAmong the adorable cubs, she found one that was different.\nThis sleeping cub had a pair of small wings and pure white fur with black stripes.\nMost strikingly, there was a golden emblem on its forehead, making it look noble and mysterious.\nWith semi-circular ears and what looked like golden eye makeup around its eyes, this cub appeared both divine and incredibly cute.\nBy the end of her inspection, Mama Tiger’s stern eyes softened, charmed by this adorable cub.\nIt wasn’t that she was too weak; it was that this \"ferociously cute\" newcomer was too irresistible.\nAfter being mesmerized for a moment, Mama Tiger quickly shook her head.\n’No, this isn’t the time to get lost in thought. Where is this strange little cub come from? And why does she have wings? Is she abandoned because of them? Or maybe... maybe my husband has a secret affair with some birdie and left this cub with me?’\nMama Tiger’s expression turned fierce. Regardless of whether her guess was right or wrong, she’d give Daddy Tiger a good thrashing when he got back.\nBut now, the most pressing issue was what to do with this little cub.\nMama Tiger picked up the cub with her paw, deep in thought.\nArix woke up in this situation.",

      "content": "Chapter 95: Blessing of the Moon Goddess\nAs soon as she opened her eyes, she found herself being held by a very large, very fierce-looking tiger.\nHer just-awakened brain hadn’t started working properly, and she thought she was about to be eaten. Her eyes welled up with tears, and she started crying out, \"Awoo awooo! (Help! There’s a big tiger!)\"\nRealizing that something was off with her voice, Arix tried to say \"Good morning,\" but what came out was a babyish \"awoo.\"\nArix raised her furry paw and finally noticed something—she seemed to have turned into a little tiger.\nThis realization made Arix cry even harder, her big blue eyes welling up with huge tears.\n’Will I never turn back into a human? Will I never see Grandpa, Dad, Mom, Drexel, and Sims again?’\nThe more she thought about it, the sadder she got, and she almost cried herself into a stupor.\nMama Tiger’s heart broke watching the little cub cry. She hurriedly put Arix back into the nest and awkwardly tried to comfort her by licking her furry cheek.\nAfter licking away Arix’s tears, Mama Tiger nudged her little face with her big tiger head.\nThough Mama Tiger’s attempts at comfort were clumsy, Arix still felt warmed.\nShe slowly stopped crying, though she still looked quite downcast.\nMama Tiger, seeing Arix listless, thought she might be hungry. She divided the big rabbit into five portions, giving the best rabbit leg to Arix.\nThen, she called the other four cubs. As soon as they saw the food, they immediately started eating, not noticing anything unusual about having an extra sibling.\nMama Tiger watched her cubs eat with happiness, but when she saw Arix not eating, she softly growled, \"Awoo, awoo? ( why aren’t you eating?)\"\nArix could understand Mama Tiger, so when she heard the question, she looked up at her, then glanced at the food in front of her.\nAlthough her stomach was growling with hunger, the sight of the bloody rabbit leg made her lose all appetite.\n\"I don’t want to eat...\" Arix whimpered weakly.\nMama Tiger looked at Arix with a mix of indulgence and helplessness. She nudged the rabbit leg closer to Arix with her nose and said, \"You can’t be picky eaters, or they won’t grow strong.\"\nArix felt a bit conflicted under Mama Tiger’s doting gaze, but then she noticed some kale nearby. Her eyes lit up. She got up from the nest and hopped over to the greens, starting to nibble on them.\nMama Tiger’s jaw dropped again.\nIn her entire life, this was the first time she had seen a tiger cub eat vegetables. Watching Arix eat so happily, Mama Tiger was at a loss for words.\nAfter thinking for a moment, Mama Tiger ran out of the cave. She returned shortly, carrying several large apples. She dropped them next to Arix, who looked up in surprise.\nThe apple caught the eyes of the four cubs nearby. They sniffed them curiously.\nNot detecting food they wanted, lay back down and resumed sleeping.\n\"Come and eat this,\" Mama Tiger softly growled, directing her words to Arix.\nArix, nibbling on some greens, heard Mama Tiger and turned. She instantly spotted the large apple.\n\"Wow, big apples!\" she exclaimed with a delighted growl.\nShe dashed to the apple, hugged it, and began to gnaw happily. The sweet taste was a delightful change from the bitter greens.\nSatisfied and full, Arix soon felt drowsy. Her little head began to nod off.\nMama Tiger, seeing this, gently picked Arix up and placed her back in the nest, nestling her among the other cubs.\nSurrounded by a soft, cozy environment, Arix, now asleep, stretched lazily. She nestled her head against the other cubs and drifted into a deep, comfortable sleep.\n\"Wow, Arix looks just like us now. I almost didn’t recognize her.\"\n\"Yeah, she really does. It’s like we have an extra little sibling.\"\n\"That’s how she’s supposed to look. Nothing strange about it.\"\nIn her dreams, Arix heard familiar voices nearby. Groggily, she opened her eyes and didn’t see Mama Tiger. Instead, she found Cupid and the others sitting in a row, watching her.\nArix paused, then with a delighted growl, she leaped toward the three little ones.\n\"Seeing you all makes me feel so much better. I thought I had traveled through time again,\" Arix said, her growls full of relief.\n\"Don’t worry. Here, let me give you a pat,\" Cupid said, raising a tiny paw to pat Arix.\nVita, smiling gently, watched the two adorable cubs and joined in, patting them both.\nSophia, in the middle, got squeezed and rolled her eyes, but she stayed silent. After all, sharing life and death experiences together made even the proudest more tolerant.\nAfter some playful moments, Arix finally calmed down. She looked at the three little ones and asked, \"By the way, how did I turn into a little tiger? Sophia, do you know?\"\n\"The little tiger has always been your animal form. It was just sealed away before. The other ’Arix’ helped you unlock your gene lock, which is like unsealing it,\" Sophia replied casually.\n\"Can I turn back into a human?\" Arix asked nervously.\nSophia nodded first, then shook her head, making Arix feel all jittery inside. Even her four little paws started to tremble.\n’If I can’t turn back into a human, what will happen to me? I’m such a cute little tiger, what if some male tiger takes me away to be a captive mate when I grow up? What then? No way! I can’t accept the idea of a human-animal romance!’\nThe more Arix let her imagination run wild, the more she felt like a tiny cabbage in a field, small and vulnerable, always worrying about being devoured by a wild boar.\nSeeing Arix’s expressions switch between indignation and terror, Sophia quickly caught on. She interrupted, \"Of course, you can turn back into a human, but there’s a condition. You need the Moon Goddess’s blessing. Right now, you’re like a therian cub, and in the Empire, a therian cub who hasn’t received the Moon Goddess’s blessing can’t shift to human form.\"\n\"Then what are we waiting for? Let’s go find the Moon Goddess!\" Arix’s eyes lit up with determination.\n\"It’s not that simple. To receive the Moon Goddess’s blessing, you need to participate in the Empire’s Pontifex’s annual blessing ceremony. As a lone cub, you can’t join the ceremony unless you find a therian willing to adopt you and take you there,\" Sophia explained, looking a bit troubled.\nIt seemed impossible for them to find someone in this remote wilderness. And, convincing them to help Arix would be another challenge.\nWhat Sophia was thinking about, Arix was considering too.\nSitting on the ground, she propped her chin up with her paw and pondered. Maybe she could learn from the stray cats from her previous life and try to play cute and helpless to get adopted.\nOr she could pretend to be an abandoned cub and lie at someone’s doorstep, looking pitiful and innocent to solicit adoption.\nAs a last resort, she could join the Empire’s orphanage and receive the blessing with other orphaned therian cubs.\nThinking these ideas were good, Arix decided to set off. Her parents and brothers were probably still worried about her, so the sooner she set off, the sooner she could contact them.\nHowever, just as she was about to leave, an image of Mama Tiger flashed through her mind. Arix hesitated and stopped, turning to Cupid and the others. \"Let’s wait a bit. After saying goodbye to Mama Tiger, we’ll set off.\"\nCupid and the others agreed without much fuss and nodded. Seeing the tiger cubs awake, they went over to play with them. Despite being cubs themselves, they tried to pet the other cubs.\nArix sat at the cave entrance, smiling as she watched the seven cubs playfully tussling with each other. But as they waited, instead of Mama Tiger, two poachers arrived.\n\"Yep, this is the cave. I saw that Celesterror Tiger coming in and out of here every day. There must be cubs inside. If we catch them and sell them, we’ll make a fortune,\" a sleazy-looking middle-aged man said.\n\"Good, then what are we waiting for then? The tiger just left not long ago. Let’s hurry and grab the cubs inside,\" another voice, greedy and impatient, urged.\nArix’s heart raced. She knew they had to act quickly. She signaled to Cupid and the others to stay quiet and move back into the shadows of the cave. They needed to protect the cubs and themselves until Mama Tiger returned.\n\"Stay close,\" Arix whispered, her voice steady despite the fear bubbling inside her. \"We’ll figure out a plan.\"\nCupid, Vita, and Sophia nodded, their faces serious. They huddled together, ready to defend their new family against the threat that loomed just outside the cave.\nArix’s eyes turned icy at the poachers’ words. When she looked toward the cave entrance, even her little tiger fangs were bared.\n\"Arix, what’s wrong?\" Cupid and the others noticed her unusual state and asked worriedly.\n\"Poachers! They’re here to catch the tiger cubs,\" Arix said, her voice laced with fierce determination.\nNot only did she despise poachers, but Mama Tiger had shown her kindness. There was no way she would let anyone harm these tiger cubs!",

      "content": "Chapter 96: Fighting The Poachers\nHearing Arix’s words, the three little ones got instantly furious, even Sophia’s face turned cold.\n\"I’m so mad! These bad guys, Arix, let’s go! Let’s go out and beat them up!\" Cupid said, baring his teeth in anger.\n\"No, Cupid, I’ll go. You all go back to my psychic world,\" Arix replied, shaking his head.\n\"Why? They’re not like the insectoid crown prince, why should we be afraid of them?\" Cupid felt extremely upset.\n\"Cupid, listen to Arix. We are Psychic Incarnations. If we show up in front of therian, it will reveal that we’re from the Alliance, and that would definitely cause trouble for Arix. You wouldn’t want that, right?\" Vita comforted Cupid, gently patting his head.\nOnly those from the Alliance could have Psychic Incarnations. In the Empire, therian ranked by the purity of their bloodline. The purer the bloodline, the higher the talent. For example, royalty like Cassian, a pureblood of the werewolf clan, had both psychic and physical powers of Supergiant+ Class. But even Cassian could never have a Psychic Incarnation. As for why Empire people didn’t have Psychic Incarnations, scientifically, it was likely due to a missing gene in therian. Only their Creator knew why.\nHearing Vita’s explanation, Cupid could only nod, feeling dejected.\n\"Arix, be careful. If you can’t handle it, call us out,\" Cupid reminded Arix, still worried.\n\"Alright, thanks, Cupid,\" Arix felt warm inside, smiling and nodding in reassurance.\nAfter the three little ones went back, Arix’s smile faded, his eyes turning icy as he looked outside. Not waiting for the two poachers to come in, Arix walked out directly. He didn’t want to damage Mama Tiger’s cave during the fight.\nThe two poachers, one tall and one fat, didn’t expect a cub to walk out on its own. They both grinned, like two creeps suddenly seeing a stunning beauty walking towards them.\n\"Oh my, this fur, those eyes, and that golden emblem. We’re going to make a fortune! If we take it to the auction, we can easily get at least a billion credits,\" the skinny poacher couldn’t wait, rubbing his hands, ready to grab Arix and live the high life.\n\"Yeah, but why does she have wings? That doesn’t look much like a Celesterror, more like a therian cub. I remember the Tiger clan, whose patriarch is part of the Empire’s Pontifex, they have wings too,\" the other poacher, Elio, hesitated.\nWhile the Empire also forbid capturing wild Celesterrors, the punishment wasn’t severe, usually just a fine. But kidnapping therian cubs was a different matter. It wasn’t something that fines or jail time can resolve. At worst, it’s a lifetime of mining on a remote planet, at best, it’s immediate execution.\n\"What are you afraid of? So what if it’s a therian cub? We’re in the middle of nowhere. Even if we sell it, no one will find out. Don’t forget, the Empire isn’t above selling therian cubs. And think about it, this cub is worth at least a hundred billion credits,\" the skinny poacher, driven mad by greed, argued, his eyes bloodshot with frenzy.\nThe fat poacher, initially hesitant due to his concerns, was gradually swayed by the skinny one’s words. His eyes also started to show a crazed glint. Right, if no one found out, he could make a hundred billion credits too. As long as no one discovered it, everything would be fine.\nThe clarity in the fat poacher’s eyes was gradually replaced by greed, and the abyss of desire devoured his soul.\nArix, who initially only wanted to teach them a lesson, felt a murderous intent rising within. These two wretched individuals were, in some ways, worse than the insectoids. The evil of the insectoids was straightforward; they openly stated their intention to eat you. But these two hid behind a human facade, committing acts worse than beasts.\nLetting evil people go was no better than harming others directly. So, Arix didn’t hold back anymore. The terrifying psychic power transformed into two mental spikes, stabbing into the two poachers’ brains.\nHowever, Arix couldn’t bring herself to end their lives. Instead, she destroyed their brain areas, rendering them brainless for life. Only by some future chance might they recover, but by then, Arix was sure they would have suffered enough to atone for their sins.\nAfter dealing with the two, Arix used her psychic power to bind them and tossed them far into the forest, as trash belongs in the trash can. If there was no trash can, then at least throw it far away, out of sight.\nAfter all this, Arix returned to the cave, obediently waiting for Mama Tiger.\nAround noon, Mama Tiger finally returned with two preys in her mouth.\nAs soon as she entered the cave, Mama Tiger saw Arix, seemingly waiting for her, and her heart instantly felt touched.\nShe put down the preys. Feeling her mouth filthy, she didn’t lick Arix but gently rubbed her massive head against Arix.\n\"What’s wrong, cub? Did you miss Mama?\" Mama Tiger had completely accepted Arix as her own cub, her tone filled with motherly love.\nArix nodded obediently, rubbing her head against Mama Tiger’s leg. Then she howled, \"Some bad people came earlier, trying to take us. Luckily, someone I don’t know chased them away.\"\nHearing this, Mama Tiger was startled. She quickly checked her cubs to make sure none were missing, then sighed in relief. She then howled to Arix, \"Cub, wait here for Mama. I’ll go check outside.\"\nAfter speaking, Mama Tiger darted outside and indeed found human footprints near the cave. Her eyes immediately turned fierce. She sniffed the scent left by the footprints, her gaze full of killing intent. Then she quickly ran into the nearby forest.\n\"Roar!\" Mama Tiger let out a thunderous roar and charged in the direction of the two poachers. When she returned, there were clear traces of blood at the corners of her mouth.\nSeeing the blood on Mama Tiger’s mouth, Arix could already guess the misery of the two men. However, she felt no remorse. In this world, you’d eventually face the consequences of your actions. Those who brought it upon themselves deserved no sympathy from Arix.",

      "content": "Chapter 97: Goodbye Mama Tiger\nWhen Mama Tiger returned, she spotted Arix waiting at the cave entrance. Not wanting to scare her with the blood on her mouth, she quickly turned to lick it clean.\nFeeling better, she turned back and looked at Arix gently. \"Why are you still waiting at the door? Are you still scared? Don’t worry, the bad guys are gone.\"\nSeeing Mama Tiger’s gentle demeanor, Arix felt a pang of sadness about their impending separation, and her eyes welled up with tears. But she remembered the Alliance and Thaddeus and Fleur waiting for her. Gathering her resolve, she said, \"I’m sorry, Mama Tiger, I have to go.\"\n\"Go? No way! You’re my little one. How can you leave? You’re still so young; it’s too dangerous out there!\" Mama Tiger said anxiously.\n\"Mama Tiger, I’m actually from the Alliance. My name is Arix Kering. I don’t know how, but I suddenly turned into a tiger cub. I have to go to the capital city to find the Pontifex and receive the Moon Goddess’s blessing to turn back into a human. Then I’ll return to the Alliance to find my real parents,\" Arix said firmly, looking into Mama Tiger’s eyes.\nAfter hearing Arix’s story, Mama Tiger was silent for a long time. Finally, she raised a big paw and placed it on Arix’s head, saying sadly, \"Do you really have to go? Can’t you stay?\"\nArix shook her head, her voice resolute. \"My parents are waiting for me, so I have to go back. They must be very worried about me now.\"\nMama Tiger lowered her paw and sighed, \"Alright, wait here.\"\nShe walked out of the cave and let out a deafening roar. Soon, a tiger even larger than Mama Tiger appeared at the entrance. Daddy Tiger looked at Mama Tiger in confusion and asked, \"What’s going on with our little one?\"\nMama Tiger whispered with Daddy Tiger for a while. After he nodded, she came over, picked Arix up, and placed her on her back.\n\"The forest is still too dangerous. I’ll take you to the edge of the forest,\" she said gently to Arix.\n\"Okay, thank you, Mama Tiger,\" Arix replied, touched by the gesture.\nThough Arix could leave the forest on her own, she wasn’t familiar with the terrain and would waste a lot of time. She was deeply moved that Mama Tiger, a Celesterror, was so considerate.\nThinking of those hunters who mercilessly hunted Celesterrors, a cold glint flashed in Arix’s eyes. She silently made a decision.\nIn the future, when she had the power, she would ensure the Empire’s Celesterrors were protected by law, just like in the Alliance, so they could live happily under the sun.\nOn the way out of the forest, Mama Tiger shared all the important things she knew with Arix.\nShe explained that the full name of the Empire was \"the Empire of Sacred Moonlight,\" which had six major legions.\nThe first was the Werewolf Legion, directly under the royal family. Blessed by the Moon Goddess, werewolves had the purest bloodlines and were the strongest of the six legions.\nThe second was the Dragon Legion, led by dragonkins. Known as the warmongers of the Empire, they were powerful but troublesome, greedy, and stingy.\nThe third was the Tiger Legion, led by tigermen. Most of the Empire’s priests came from the tiger clan, and they were the only ones the dragonkins dared not provoke.\nThe fourth was the Phoenix Legion, led by birdmen. They were generally indifferent to everything except insectoids, which they loved to study and find new ways to eat.\nThe fifth was the Merman Legion, led by mermen. Simple-minded and strong, they were close to the dragonkins and often used by them as the front line in battles.\nThe sixth was the Elf Legion, led by elves. They were the pacifists of the Empire, often at odds with dragonkins but close to the tigermen.\n\"Arix, if you ever encounter dragonkins, be very careful. They are all bad news,\" Mama Tiger warned.\n\"Okay, Mama Tiger,\" Arix nodded obediently.\n\"And remember, this planet is under the jurisdiction of tigermen. Since you are a tigerman cub, you can ask them for help if needed. They should assist you as a fellow tribe member,\" Mama Tiger added, worrying over every detail to ensure Arix’s safety.\n\"Got it,\" Arix said, feeling deeply touched by Mama Tiger’s clear love and concern. She nuzzled Mama Tiger’s neck with her small head.\nMama Tiger felt Arix’s affection, stopped, and nuzzled back lovingly. The sunlight filtered through the leaves, casting a warm glow on the two of them, making the moment feel timeless.\nUnfortunately, beautiful moments are fleeting, and before they knew it, they had reached the edge of the forest. Arix jumped down from Mama Tiger’s back, lingering with her for a bit longer before finally saying, \"Mama Tiger, I have to go now.\"\n\"Take care and stay safe,\" Mama Tiger said, raising a big paw to gently rub Arix’s head.\n\"Okay,\" Arix said as she looked at Mama Tiger one last time before turning and walking away.\nAfter a few steps, Arix suddenly heard Mama Tiger call out. She stopped and turned, thinking there was something Mama Tiger had forgotten to tell her.\n\"Arix!\" Mama Tiger sat down, looking at Arix tenderly.\n\"Mama Tiger, what’s wrong?\" Arix asked, puzzled.\nMama Tiger smiled, her eyes soft and tender. She let out a light growl, then turned and disappeared back into the forest.\n\"Thank you for saving my little ones.\"\nMama Tiger had long realized that, since only Arix and the scent of the two poachers were outside the cave, it must have been Arix who had saved her cubs, not someone else Arix had claimed.\nHearing Mama Tiger’s words, Arix’s pupils constricted, and a wave of sentiments surged in her heart. Tears began to flow down her cheeks as she watched the direction Mama Tiger had left.\nThen, resolutely, she turned and ran forward.\nShe couldn’t stay any longer; otherwise, she would find it too hard to leave.\nAs Arix ran, crying, she made a firm decision in her heart. In the future, she would ensure that the Empire’s Celesterrors were also protected.\nThough Celesterrors were fierce on the outside, they were pure and smart inside. They deserved to be treated kindly.",

      "content": "Chapter 98: Purity of Bloodline\nArix had no clue how long she’d been running. When she finally spotted the city walls, she took a deep breath and slowed down.She found a tree to hide behind and peeked out at the city gate.\nTwo knights in full armor stood guard at the entrance, with a few soldiers managing the entrance fees. A line of therianthropes waited, each using an opticomputer to pay a credit point before entering.\nArix held back, watching the therians with interest. She remembered reading on an opticomputer that the purer a therian’s bloodline, the more human-like their transformation. Therians with less pure bloodlines kept more of their animal traits.\nShe spotted a child with animal ears and a fox tail waiting in line.\nTo Arix, the child was adorable, but the other therians seemed to view him with disdain. As the child’s turn came to enter, a burly therian kicked him aside and cut in line.\nThe other therians didn’t react. They were used to this and didn’t show any sympathy. The line-cutter had only a slight therian feature at the corner of his eye, showing his high bloodline purity. No one wanted to mess with him over a low-purity child.\nIn fact, many thought this was just the way things should be. To them, therians with low bloodline purity didn’t deserve to stand with the rest. The poorly dressed child seemed used to this treatment. He quietly got up and moved to the back of the line.\nArix frowned but didn’t jump in. She had the power to help, but how could she make sure the bully wouldn’t take it out on the child later? Sometimes, trying to help could make things worse.\nIf she got the chance later, she might teach that therian a lesson.\nArix despised bullies. She dealt with them whenever she could.\nBut right now, her main goal was to find an opticomputer and contact her parents in the Alliance, who were probably worried sick.\nShe looked down at her own fluffy white fur and small wings. If she went out like this, she’d be caught in no time.\n\"Sophia, can I retract these wings?\" Arix asked in her mind.\n\"Just think about it,\" Sophia replied calmly.\n\"Thanks, Sophia,\" Arix said. She then thought,\n’Retract, retract.’\nA faint white light flashed, and her wings disappeared into her body.\nArix twisted her body left and right, making sure her wings were really gone. Then she let out a joyful howl.\nNext, she spotted a nearby coal pile. She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and rolled in it several times. The once cute little white tiger was now like a filthy, unrecognizable stray cat.\nHappy with her new look, Arix relaxed and waited by the roadside, keeping an eye out for a chance to sneak into the city.\nAfter a bit, an elderly therian pushing a two-wheeled cart full of vegetables slowly came by. Arix’s eyes lit up, and she quickly burrowed into the pile of vegetables, hiding quietly.\nLuckily, the therian inspections here weren’t as strict as those in the Alliance. The old man paid the fee, the soldier at the gate glanced at the vegetables, and let him through.\nOnce inside, Arix breathed a sigh of relief. As they passed a dim alley, she quickly slipped out and hid in the shadows. Everything was going according to plan. Now, she needed to find an opticomputer to contact her parents and let them know she was safe.\nNew opticomputers had psychic power bindings, acting like password locks that were impossible to bypass. Older models, though, were much easier to hack. Arix had already figured out where to find one.\nIt didn’t take long for her to choose a target—a poor elderly therian who rarely used his opticomputer, usually leaving it on his bed. Arix waited by the window, and when the old man lay down to rest, she whispered an apology in her mind.\nShe then snuck into the room, grabbed the opticomputer in her mouth, and dashed to the basement.\nOnce she confirmed it was safe, she turned on the device and dialed her mother’s number. A video call request was sent.\nBack at the Kering Family home...\nEver since they heard Arix might have died, the whole household had been drowning in sorrow.\nThe masters of the house were heartbroken, and even the butler and maids were visibly upset.\nThe death of a 15-year-old girl, even if she were a stranger, would make anyone sad. But this was their young lady, their sweet and unfortunate daughter. Everyone felt a deep sense of loss.\nFleur, after hearing about her daughter’s disappearance yet again, had locked herself in her bedroom, silently crying while holding Arix’s belongings.\n\"Arix...\" Fleur whispered hoarsely.\n\"Ma’am, there is an incoming video call from an unknown opticomputer number. Would you like to accept it?\"\nThe opticomputer on Fleur’s nightstand suddenly rang, its soft sound breaking the silence of the room.\nFleur glanced at the opticomputer. Assuming it was another marketing call, she ignored it, continuing to reminisce about her daughter.\n\"Ma’am, there is an incoming video call from an unknown opticomputer number. Would you like to accept it?\"\nThe opticomputer kept ringing. Fleur frowned and finally picked it up, answering the call. As soon as the video connected, a small, pitch-black animal appeared on the screen. It looked like a stray cat.\nFleur’s gaze remained indifferent. Since her daughter disappeared, she felt detached from the world. Everything seemed dull and lifeless to her, unable to stir any interest.\nHowever, when Arix saw her mother’s haggard appearance, she immediately panicked. She even forgot she had transformed into a therian and quickly let out a howl, \"Awwooo(Mom, are you okay)?\"\nFleur seemed to get it, her body trembling all of a sudden. She stared at the stray cat in the video, her eyes wide with disbelief.\n\"Arix?\" she called out, her voice a mix of exhausted sorrow and ecstatic joy.\nArix was just as shocked that Fleur could understand her.\nBut there was no time to dwell on it. She quickly reassured Fleur, \"Mom, don’t worry. I fell into a wormhole that took me to the Empire. But I’m safe now. Please, don’t worry.\"\nFleur smiled in relief, but tears still fell. How could she not know if her daughter was truly safe? Arix wouldn’t be in this state if she was fine.\n\"Mom, why are you crying? I really am safe. Please, don’t cry,\" Arix said, clumsily trying to wipe away Fleur’s tears on the virtual screen.\nOf course, it didn’t work since it was just a screen. Yet, Arix’s attempt made Fleur laugh through her tears. \"I’m not crying; these are happy tears. My silly Arix.\"\nSeeing her mom laugh, Arix felt better. Then, she asked, \"Mom, how can you understand me? Are you a therian too?\"\nArix wasn’t expecting much when she asked, but Fleur nodded, her face a mix of emotions. \"My parents were from the Empire’s Tiger Clan. Your grandfather was the clan’s strongest tigerman. They fell in love and had me. But one day, your grandmother got very sick and was near death. To save her, your grandfather joined the Moon Goddess Temple and became a priest. Priests belong to the Moon Goddess for life, so they can’t marry or love anyone again. If they do, both lovers are hunted by the temple. That’s why your grandparents were separated. Heartbroken, your grandmother took me to live in the Alliance, but she still passed away when I was eighteen.\"\nHearing this, Arix fumed. \"Mom, can we destroy the Moon Goddess Temple? Banning love? So old-fashioned! Ridiculous!\"\nFleur laughed softly, calming her down. \"Arix, your grandparents weren’t wrong, and neither was the Moon Goddess Temple. The temple just offered a choice, and your grandfather made his. There’s no right or wrong in that. Your grandmother got to live a few more years because of it. We shouldn’t destroy a place that helped us.\"\n\"But the Moon Goddess Temple kept Grandpa and Grandma apart,\" Arix argued, still upset.\nFleur spoke softly, trying to calm Arix down. \"But think about it. If the Moon Goddess Temple hadn’t saved Grandma, Grandpa couldn’t have been with her.\"\n\"Alright, fine. If I had been there, they wouldn’t have had to part,\" Arix muttered under her breath.\n\"Arix, let the past stay in the past. The best ending is when no one regrets their choices. Now, let’s focus on you. Stay where you are, and I’ll have my cousin Sunak come to pick you up,\" Fleur instructed.\nAlthough Arix had no idea who that was, she nodded obediently.\n\"Good girl,\" Fleur said with a smile before ending the call.\nArix then sent videos to other family members. Sadly, none of them could understand what she was saying, not even Kellan.\nLuckily, she could still type with her paws; otherwise, she wouldn’t have been able to assure them she was safe.",

      "content": "Chapter 99: Getting Saved\nWhen it was Drexel’s turn, Arix decided to keep her identity a secret to tease him a bit. As soon as the video connected, however, she saw Drexel’s scruffy face and dark circles under his eyes.\nArix started to cry.\n\"Awooo...\" she whimpered.\nDrexel frowned, feeling his hallucinations getting worse. Ever since Arix went missing, he often felt like she was calling him or thought he saw her waiting for him.\nRubbing his temples in exhaustion, he looked at the stray cat on the virtual screen, which seemed to be crying.\n\"Hey, little thing, do you need something?\" Drexel’s voice was hoarse, but he tried to speak gently.\nHis question only made Arix cry harder. She felt guilty for wanting to tease her brother, knowing he must be worried sick about her.\nLarge tears rolled down Arix’s cheeks as she cried out, \"AWWWWOO(I’m Arix! You don’t understand me, do you? I’ll send you words).\"\nDrexel looked up, surprised at the tiger on the screen. This time he was sure he wasn’t hallucinating. It seemed like the little cub was really talking and claimed to be Arix.\n\"If you’re really Arix, nod your head and raise a paw,\" Drexel said, staring intently at the black stray cat on the screen.\nArix quickly did as he asked. Drexel jumped up, looking like he’d just gotten a shot of adrenaline. He grabbed the opticomputer and ran outside, eager to share the good news with their parents.\nAs he reached the living room, he saw their parents and older brother were also there.\nExcitedly, he shouted, \"Mom, Dad, Kellan, it’s Arix! Look, it’s Arix!!!\"\nTo Drexel’s surprise, his parents and Kellan remained calm, nodding to indicate they already knew.\nDrexel was so confused.\n’Why isn’t anyone excited?’\nThinking they hadn’t heard him correctly, Drexel repeated, \"Mom, Dad, Kellan, this is Arix! Arix!!!\"\nThis time, Fleur, feeling a bit impatient, replied, \"We know. We found out a while ago.\"\nDrexel stood there dumbfounded for a moment, then, realizing what was happening, his expression turned fierce. He looked at Arix on the virtual screen with a menacing grin, \"Arix? So I was the last to know?\"\nArix: .....\n’I think I’m in trouble.’\nArix blinked nervously. Trying to act casual, she used her paw to smooth the fur on her ear, playing up her stray cat persona to avoid Drexel’s questions.\n\"Come on, stop pretending,\" Drexel said, clearly irritated but with a hint of laughter. \"Using your paw like that, isn’t that kind of dirty?\"\n’Dirty?’\nArix’s eyes went wide, like she’d been struck by lightning. Her heart sank.\n’No one should call a cute cub dirty!’\nFuming, she ended the video call, not wanting to see Drexel’s face any longer. Drexel, staring at the suddenly dark screen, looked confused. Everything seemed fine a moment ago.\nNearby, Kellan chuckled. \"That’s what you get for calling a girl dirty. It’s like telling a guy he’s useless.\"\nDrexel rubbed his nose, feeling guilty. But he was relieved to know Arix was okay.\nMeanwhile, Arix tried to reach Cassian, but the video call wouldn’t connect. After several attempts, she gave up and sent a message instead, letting him know she was safe.\nHaving contacted everyone she could, Arix returned the opticomputer to the old therian and waited outside by the gate for the legendary Sunak to arrive.\nHalf an hour later, a young man with silver hair and blue eyes, dressed in an Empire captain’s uniform, appeared. Arix looked at his white hair and blue eyes, matching her own.\nThis had to be her savior, Sunak!\nExcited, Arix stood up, ready to greet him with a loving hug. But he walked right past her.\nArix was stunned.\n’Am I wrong? Or is his vision that bad?’\n\"Where’s my cousin’s daughter? I don’t see her.\" The silver-haired, blue-eyed man looked around, confused.\nArix sighed.\n’Yep, this was definitely Sunak.’\nAs Sunak walked further away, Arix finally shouted, \"I’m over here!\"\nSunak turned at the sound of her voice, finally spotting the little black furball squatting by the gate.\n\"Arix?\" Sunak called uncertainly.\n\"Yep,\" Arix responded coolly.\nSunak’s face lit up with excitement. He rushed over to pick her up, but at the last moment, he hesitated, pulled back his hands, and awkwardly cleared his throat.\n\"Uh, Arix, what’s with this look? It’s... unique,\" Sunak said, trying to hide his distaste. But his eyes kept straying from the soot-covered Arix.\nWith a vein popping on her forehead, Arix jumped straight into Sunak’s arms and rolled around a few times on purpose.\nSunak was speechless. The urge to drop her crossed his mind.\nBut his clothes were already dirty, and dropping his niece on the ground wouldn’t fix that. Resigned, Sunak held the filthy Arix and headed back to his fleet.\nHe had been in the middle of a mission when he got a distress call from his cousin. Since it was on his way, he asked his admiral for leave to pick up his niece.\nArix, snug in Sunak’s arms, was carried onto the Empire’s space carrier.\n\"Arix, you need to behave on the carrier. Once I finish my mission, I’ll take you home,\" Sunak coaxed, as if she were a child.\n\"Don’t worry, Uncle Sunak. I’ll be super well-behaved,\" Arix said, puffing out her little chest with determination.\nSunak patted Arix’s head, thinking his niece seemed better-behaved than the boys back home.\nHe found a resting room for Arix and waited outside while she took a bath, planning to take her to report to the admiral afterward.\nArix bathed quickly. Before long, she pushed open the door and jumped out of the bathroom, shaking the water off her fur.\nSeeing the safe and comfortable surroundings, Arix decided to let out her small wings. Keeping them tucked in all the time was uncomfortable.\n\"After a bath, you’re much cuter,\" Sunak said with a satisfied smile, reaching to pick up Arix and blow-dry her fur.\nBut this time, Arix turned the tables. She quickly jumped away from Sunak’s bear hug, looking at him with disdain. \"Don’t hug me, you’re dirty!\"\nSunak was taken aback. He looked down at his soot-covered uniform and felt amused.\n\"You’ve got some nerve complaining. Who’s little troublemaker doing this?\" Sunak said irritably.\nArix’s eyes darted around, pretending not to understand what Sunak was saying.\nSunak rolled his eyes but didn’t argue with the young one.\nHe took out a new opticomputer and Space Button from his Space Button and placed them on the bed.\n\"These are your opticomputer and Space Button. The fur dryer is over there. Use it before you get on the bed. I’m going to take a shower,\" Sunak instructed carefully.\nThe fur dryer was a must-have in the Empire. Whether furry or not, all therians liked to use it. It was great for drying fur, skin, or scales.\nSeeing the opticomputer and Space Button, Arix’s high-and-mighty demeanor vanished. She smiled like a pleased puppy and said, \"Alright, Sunak, go take your shower.\"\nSunak, looking at his niece’s sudden change in attitude, snorted.\nWith a resigned smile, he took off his jacket and headed into the bathroom.\nArix’s smile vanished as soon as Sunak stepped into the bathroom. She swiftly opened the fur dryer, hopped in, and pressed the button. Warm air surrounded her, drying her fur in no time.\nOnce done, Arix jumped out of the dryer and onto the bed, opening her new opticomputer. She followed the setup instructions, binding it with her psychic power. Then, she entered Fleur’s opticomputer number and initiated a video call.\nThe call connected quickly. Before Fleur could speak, Arix let out a cute whine, \"Mom, do you miss me?\"\nFleur chuckled but didn’t respond immediately. Thaddeus leaned into the frame with a big grin, \"Sweetheart, do you miss your dad?\"\nArix nodded enthusiastically, her tiny voice sweet as she replied, \"Yes, I miss you both so much!\"\nThis adorable display made Thaddeus and Fleur beam with joy, their faces lighting up with smiles.",

      "content": "Chapter 100: Pontifex of the Future\nThe three of them chatted for a bit, exchanging greetings until they were about to end the video call.Fleur gave a final reminder, \"Arix, I asked our people, and the blessing ceremony is next month. You should stay in the Empire and have fun with Sunak this month. I’ve already taken care of your leave from the military school. Come back to class when your therian transformation is over.\"\n\"Okay, I got it. Bye, Mom,\" Arix said obediently, nodding her little head and giving a small howl.\nAfter Fleur ended the call with a smile, Sunak came out of the bathroom. He was still damp, and he casually asked, \"Were you talking to your mom?\"\n\"Yeah, she said some ceremony is next month, and she was afraid I’ll have to be in your care this month,\" Arix explained with a small howl.\n\"She’s always so considerate. I love kids and we’re gonna have so much fun.\" Sunak said nonchalantly as he walked into the drying box. He lay down on the drying chair for a few minutes and came out completely dry.\nArix, thinking about her own physical power accident, kept quiet.\n\"Come on, I’ll take you to meet our admiral. We should report your presence to him, especially given your special status,\" Sunak said, picking Arix up and carrying her toward the admiral’s meeting room.\n’Admiral?’\nArix remembered that people at this rank were usually old grandpa types. The Empire’s admiral was probably a respected elder therian as well.\n\"By the way, Arix, when you meet the admiral, don’t do anything disrespectful. If you annoy him, he might not let you stay on the mothership,\" Sunak warned.\n\"Hmph, no way,\" Arix huffed arrogantly. All the elders at home adored her because she was polite and talented. All the older loved her!\nArix’s assumption was just partly right; when she actually met the admiral, she quietly took back her words.\nThe person in front of her, with snow-white hair and an icy, ethereal demeanor, was the last person Arix would consider as an admiral before.\nArix turned her head to look at Sunak, incredulously howling, \"Is he really the admiral??\"\nSunak, not knowing why Arix was asking this, nodded affirmatively.\nOnce she was sure there was no mistake, Arix turned back, carefully observing the Empire’s admiral.\nHe looked to be around just twenty years old, with chiseled features and an exceptionally handsome face. His slightly prominent brow bone framed a pair of ice-blue eyes colder than millennia-old glacier, and his thin lips added to his cold demeanor. His entire look exuded a ’keep away’ vibe.\nHe was cold, but really good-looking.\nArix’s heart was pounding wildly. Since arriving in the interstellar era, this was the second exceptionally handsome male she had encountered.\nThe first one she met was Cassian, and the other one was the Empire’s admiral in front of her.\nIf Cassian was like the god of the sun—noble, handsome, and gentle—then the admiral before her was like the moon in the deep night. He was so graceful that any closer look at him felt like a desecration. Even one extra glance seemed disrespectful.\nSunak had no idea that Arix was so mesmerized that she was almost drooling. He respectfully addressed the admiral, \"Sir, this is my niece Arix. She is the granddaughter of the Fifth Legion admiral from the Alliance. She’s a special kid, so I brought her to report to you.\"\nHearing she was the Fifth Legion admiral’s granddaughter, Scion’s emotionless eyes, as cold and deep as a frozen pond, finally looked at the little one before him. His gaze softened a bit when he saw that Arix was just a cub. \"No problem, just take good care of her.\"\n\"Yes, thank you, sir. I’ll take my leave now.\" Sunak placed his right hand on his chest in salute. Then he turned and carried Arix out of the meeting room.\nOn the way back to the resting quarters, Arix looked up and asked, \"Sunak, the Empire’s admiral is so young. And why does he seem so distant? Did he have a rough childhood?\"\nAs Arix asked, her mind had already conjured up dozens of dramatic scenarios, mostly involving childhood trauma or later life events, with family harm being the most likely cause.\n\"Give me a break,\" Sunak rolled his eyes. \"The admiral’s status in the clan is second only to the Pontifex. Even the clan leader treats him with utmost respect. As for his personality, most pontifexs are like that.\"\n\"Pontifex? But isn’t he the admiral?\" Arix asked, her eyes widening in surprise.\n\"He was, well, sort of. The admirals were raised to be the Pontifexs. There’s currently no one qualified to lead the Tiger Legion, so he’s temporarily acting as admiral. When the Pontifex steps down or a suitable therian is found to replace the admiral, the current admiral will return to the Moon Goddess Temple as the Pontifex’s successor,\" Sunak explained in rare detail.\n\"Okay,\" Arix’s heart, which had been racing like a deer, suddenly came to a halt.\nTo Arix, a pontifex was akin to a pastor from her past life. She never imagined someone as hot as the admiral would choose such a restrictive path.\nSunak noticed the disappointed little tiger in his arms. He raised an eyebrow with a light, knowing smile.\nThe admiral was perfect in many ways, but that face of his was a real troublemaker. It was better to give Arix a heads-up for peace of mind.\nHaving been around the admiral for a long time, Sunak was well aware of how attractive the admiral was to females, from toothless old ladies to toothless toddlers. No one could resist the admiral’s charm.\nAdmiral Scion was the kind of man who could make even the most confident playboy feel inadequate and teary-eyed. However, he had one major flaw: his future role as the Pontifex.\nAny woman who liked the admiral would instantly give up once she learned he was destined to become the Pontifex. This tactic had never failed Sunak. No woman would want to fall for a man who was fated to devote his life to the Moon Goddess.\nArix had no idea what Sunak was thinking. After sulking for a bit, she put the matter out of her mind. Right now, her only focus was on food. She had only nibbled on some vegetables and an apple since morning, and her stomach was practically empty.",

      "content": "Chapter 101: The Starship Carrier\n\"Uncle Sunak, I’m hungry,\" Arix said, whining a little.\n\"Alright, let’s go get some food. You can meet everyone along the way,\" Sunak said with a gentle smile, affectionately ruffling Arix’s little head.\nWith that, they stopped chatting and headed straight for the military cafeteria.\nThe cafeteria of the Empire and the cafeteria of the Alliance have their unique vibes.\nIf the Alliance’s cafeteria is all about complicated cuisine, then the Empire’s cafeteria is a buffet of all kinds of raw foods. Think medium rare steak, fresh salads, fruits and nuts—all in one place.\nArix had a hunch that this variety might be due to the Empire’s diverse therian soldiers. Herbivores stick to fruits and veggies, carnivores go straight for the meat, and omnivores, like rabbit, dog, and cat therians, munch on a bit of everything.\nEmpire soldiers are super friendly to kids, so when they spotted Arix, they couldn’t help but gather around, eager to pet the little one and ask questions.\n\"Wow, Sunak, who’s this cute little one?\" A rabbit therian soldier exclaimed, eyes sparkling as they admired Arix.\n\"This is my cousin’s child. She’s busy, so I’m helping out for a month,\" Sunak replied, grinning.\n\"We’re on a mission. Isn’t it risky to have a kid around?\" a fox therian soldier asked, still gently rubbing Arix’s head.\n\"It’s okay, this mission isn’t tough. Once it’s done, I’ll take her back to the clan,\" Sunak assured them with a calm smile.\n\"It’s rare to see such a beautiful young one. Her bloodline must be very pure, right?\" Another soldier chimed in, eyes bright with curiosity.\n\"We’ll check when we get back to the clan. But she’s hungry now, so I have to go,\" Sunak said, finding an excuse to leave.\n\"Alright, don’t let the little one go hungry,\" the soldiers agreed, stepping aside reluctantly.\nAfter their meal, Sunak took Arix to the resting room. He left a quick note saying he had some business to attend to, and told Arix to play alone and not wander off. Then, he hurried out.\nArix waited until Sunak left. She then jumped off the bed, opened the door, and slipped out. After all, this was a starship carrier—too exciting to miss out on exploring.\nThe starship carrier is a massive space-aircraft combo. It usually doesn’t operate solo but with other warships, forming a fleet that can search, track, lock onto, and attack enemy targets within thousands of kilometers.\nIt looks like a huge, dark polyhedron. Its deck was on one of the surface. The deck wasn’t a channel just for annihilation spacecrafts but also for mechas. So, there was bound to be lots of mecha to see. If lucky, Arix might even catch a mecha fight.\nArix’s eyes sparkled with excitement, quickly darting through the starship carrier’s corridors.\nThe busy Empire soldiers thought the little one was just playing and didn’t pay much attention. They even kindly pointed out places where she could find fun things to do. Arix responded with a sweet little howl of thanks.\nBut when everything seems to go smoothly, surprises are bound to happen.\nTurning a corner too quickly, Arix collided with someone and, being so light, she was sent flying. Before she knew what happened, she was caught by someone using psychic power and then held in his arms.\n\"Awwo?\" Arix rubbed her little head, wincing from the collision. Looking up in confusion, she saw who it was and froze in fear.\n\"Ad...admiral?\" Arix stammered, trembling all over. Her voice shook, and even her little paws were quivering.\n’Oh no,’\nshe thought.\n’Will I be thrown off the starship carrier? Sunak has warned me repeatedly not to bother the admiral.’\n\"Sir, are you okay?\" Chris, the admiral’s aide, asked anxiously.\n\"I’m fine,\" Scion replied, waving off his concerned aide. Then he looked down at the little one in his arms.\nSeeing Arix’s fear, Scion gently rubbed her head and softly asked, \"Where’s Sunak? Why are you running around alone?\"\nRealizing the admiral wasn’t mad, Arix breathed a sigh of relief. \"Sunak went to do something. I just wanted to explore the starship carrier. Can I, Admiral? If not, I’ll go back to the resting room,\" she said, her ears drooping, showing how much she didn’t want to.\nLooking at the adorable little one from his own clan, Scion’s cold eyes softened. He patted Arix’s head and asked, \"Do you want to go around with me?\"\n\"Really?\" Arix tilted her head, looking at Scion in disbelief.\n\"Of course,\" Scion confirmed with a nod.\n\"Wow, that’s awesome!\" Arix exclaimed, bouncing happily in Scion’s arms.\nWatching the joyful little one, a small smile appeared on Scion’s face.\nFor the rest of the afternoon, Arix stayed in Scion’s arms, following him everywhere.\nWhen Scion was busy, he would put Arix down to play on her own. Arix behaved well, showing interest mainly in the machinery without causing trouble.\nScion felt a rare warmth toward the well-behaved young one. By the time he returned Arix to the resting room, their bond had grown closer.\n\"Can you take me to hang out again tomorrow?\" Arix asked sweetly. She rubbed her head against Scion, reluctant to part so soon.\nScion smiled slightly and nodded, \"Sure.\"\n\"Great, you promised, no backing out!\" Arix cheered, jumping out of Scion’s arms and heading back into the resting room.\nAs Scion looked at his now empty arms, a strange sense of emptiness washed over him. He closed his eyes, and when he opened them again, he was back to being the cold admiral. \"Let’s go,\" Scion said calmly to his aide.\n\"Yes, sir,\" Captain Chris replied respectfully.\nJust as Arix returned to the room and saw Sunak, her smile froze. She stood nervously against the wall, looking ready to bolt at any moment.\n\"Had a lot of fun, huh? What did I tell you about running around? You almost explored the entire starship carrier,\" Sunak said, giving Arix a death glare.\nHe had figured it out by now: this little one had the most obedient face but the most rebellious heart.",

      "content": "Chapter 102: Everybody’s Favorite\nArix’s eyes darted around nervously. Then, with a bit of hesitation, they shuffled over to Sunak’s side.\nRubbing their furry body against Sunak, Arix spoke in a sugary, pleading voice, \"Sunak, don’t be mad. I was just bored in the room and needed a little fresh air.\"\n\"And besides, I’m still just a little cub. If I stay cooped up all the time, I’ll get depressed and lose my fur.\" Arix’s voice mixed soft pleading with a touch of stubbornness. Her eyes welled up with tears, making them look even more pitiful.\nSunak clenched their fists, trying to stay firm, but he couldn’t resist for long. He sighed and scooped Arix up into his arms, \"Arix, you need to remember you’re still a cub and have to listen to the adults, okay?\"\n’But I’m over eighteen now!’\nArix complained inwardly, but she kept an innocent and obedient expression on their face, nodding dutifully.\nSunak looked at Arix, seeing an expression that said,\n’I’ll listen, but I’ll definitely do it again.’\nFrustrated, Sunak ruffled Arix’s hair roughly until Arix squirmed and almost nipped at them.\n\"Going out is fine, but you have to tell me first. If I can’t find you, I’ll get worried, got it?\" Sunak tried to sound stern.\n\"Got it, got it,\" Arix pouted, using their paws to smooth their ruffled fur.\n\"You cheeky brat. Alright, go play, I’m leaving.\" With a final playful ruffle of Arix’s fur, Sunak slipped out the door.\n\"Awoo!\" Arix growled in frustration, baring her teeth, wishing she could bite Sunak for that.\nThree days passed with Arix following Scion around, exploring every place of the starship carrier. During that time, the Empire soldiers grew fond of the adorable cub, often stopping to ruffle Arix’s head whenever they saw her.\nToday, however, felt different.\nThe soldiers were in a hurry, and even when they saw Arix, they didn’t stop to ruffle her head. Instead, they all told Arix to go back to their room and stay safe.\nArix nodded obediently, planning to find Scion to ask what was going on. But when she reached the conference room, she saw Scion and the others in an urgent meeting.\nHaving no other choice, Arix turned around and went back.\nOn her way back, Arix ran into Sunak. As soon as he saw her, he picked her up and started running toward the lounge, his voice filled with urgency, \"Arix, it’s too dangerous outside. Stay in your room and don’t wander around.\"\n\"Sunak, what’s going on? Can I help?\" Arix asked, her worry evident.\n\"Our mission was to eliminate the insectoid harassing the border, but it turned out to be a full-blown swarm!\" Sunak’s eyes were a mix of emotions Arix couldn’t quite decipher—anger laced with a sense of deep despair.\nArix could tell from his face that things were very bad. Otherwise, Sunak wouldn’t be so serious, even feeling guilty and blaming himself.\n\"Arix, I really shouldn’t have bought you to the front line. If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t be in this danger.\" Sunak’s voice wavered with remorse.\nSeeing Sunak so down, Arix nuzzled his neck with her furry head, trying to comfort him, \"It’s okay, Sunak. Don’t be scared. We’ll do our best together.\"\nSunak, touched, sniffled and rubbed his head against Arix’s, \"Yes, we’ll do our best together. Plus, we have the admiral. As long as he’s okay, we’ll be fine.\"\nArix felt something was off about that statement...\nSure enough, the next second, someone came rushing over, stopping Sunak and saying urgently, \"Sir, Admiral Scion is in trouble! He had a sudden psychic power rampage during the meeting!\"\n\"What!\" Sunak was so shocked he forgot he was holding Arix and took off with the messenger.\nBeing carried along, Arix, with eyes filled with a resigned look of ancient wisdom, thought,\n’Could you guys stop jinxing things during emergencies?’\nArix sighed inwardly, planning to go see the situation. If it was a psychic power issue, she might be able to help a little.\nThe three of them moved quickly, soon arriving at a quarantine room. Outside the room, three Empire officers stood anxiously.\n\"Vice Admiral De’an, Rear Admiral Frepe, Captain Chris, Lieutenant Commander Lancelot, how’s the admiral?\" Sunak asked urgently.\n\"It’s not good. The admiral’s psychic power is very strong, and after the rampage, it’s even more terrifying. Not only doctors, but even we can’t get close, so there’s no way to treat him,\" Captain Chris replied, his brow furrowed in worry.\n\"How did this happen? The admiral was fine. How could his psychic power suddenly go out of control?\" Sunak was nearly frantic with worry.\nThe insectoid swarm was already pushing them to the brink, and now their leader, the admiral, was in crisis too. Internal strife on top of external threats was driving them toward disaster.\nDe’an, the highest-ranking officer among them, punched the wall in frustration. \"Damn it! Those bastards gave us false information, and I suspect they’re behind the admiral’s psychic power rampage too.\"\n\"Without key evidence, suspicions don’t help. The urgent thing now is to find a way to save the admiral,\" Rear Admiral Frepe said, rubbing his temples in exasperation.\n\"To save the admiral, we need to subdue him first. But the admiral has Supergiant-Class psychic and physical power. Unless Prince Cassian is here, who else can subdue him?\" Lieutenant Commander Lancelot had lost hope.\n\"Even if we subdue him, what then? This is a psychic power rampage! Unless we have the newly developed psychic power treatment potion from the Alliance, there’s no hope. But where can we find such a potion now?\" Captain Chris grabbed his hair in despair, blaming himself. As the admiral’s aide, he had failed to protect him. If the admiral couldn’t be saved, he felt guilty for the rest of his life.\n\"Hmm? You need a Psychic Healer?\"\nThe sweet, childlike voice suddenly caught everyone’s attention, and they all turned eyes toward it.\nArix stood there, her expression serious yet calm.",

      "content": "Chapter 103: Saving The Admiral\nSunak glanced around, trying to figure out who was speaking. Suddenly, he realized everyone was staring at him. He looked down and saw that Arix was with him.\nRecalling what the little cub had said, Sunak quickly covered Arix’s mouth and scolded, \"Arix, this isn’t the time for jokes. I gave you the Space Button you’re using and I know what’s insdie. Where did you get a psychic power healing potion?\"\n\"Mmmph... mmph...\" Arix tried to explain, but his mouth was tightly covered.\nThe Empire officers, hearing Sunak’s scolding, averted their gazes in disappointment. They had wanted to tell Arix not to joke in such a serious situation but felt awkward since Arix was just a cub.\nWith collective sighs of disappointment, everyone resumed their discussion.\nVice Admiral De’an said calmly, \"If this continues, the admiral’s life will be in danger. We must subdue the admiral first. At least let the military doctor alleviate the psychic power rampage; only then will there be a chance for treatment. As for who will subdue the admiral... it should be me. My psychic power is the strongest among us. I’ll do my best.\"\nHis indifferent tone and expression masked the danger he was about to face—subduing someone whose psychic power level was higher than his own during a rampage. If Vice Admiral De’an did it, the best outcome would be severe injuries, and the worst would be dying alongside Admiral Scion.\n\"No! We need you to fight against the insectoid swarm. Precisely because your psychic power is the strongest among us, you can’t take the risk. I’ll go and do it,\" Rear Admiral Frepe said.\nAlthough this would put both him and the admiral in danger, Rear Admiral Frepe had to think about the safety of the 50,000 Empire soldiers on the starship carrier and warships. Losing another leader would cause internal chaos before the insectoid swarm even struck.\nVice Admiral De’an considered this point. He then clenched his fists, closed his eyes, and finally forced out a word thought his teeth, \"Fine!\"\n\"Rear Admiral Frepe, I’ll go with you. If anything happens to the admiral, I wouldn’t be able to live with myself,\" Captain Chris said firmly.\nRear Admiral Frepe was silent for a moment, then he clasped Captain Chris’s shoulder with a carefree smile, \"Alright, we’ll go together.\"\nWith his mouth covered, Arix watched the Empire officers meticulously plan their potential deaths. Feeling speechless and slightly annoyed, Arix suddenly unleashed her own psychic power.\nIn an instant, a powerful surge of psychic power knocked Sunak away and forced everyone else to take a step back under its pressure.\nThe sudden reversal brought a moment of stunned silence to the scene.\nAfter a while, Vice Admiral De’an twisted his stiff neck and looked at Sunak, sprawled on the ground. He asked cautiously, \"Is her psychic power Supergiant+?\"\nSunak, equally shocked by the unexpected turn of events, couldn’t close his dropped jaw. Hearing Vice Admiral De’an’s question, he quickly shook his head. \"I don’t know. My cousin didn’t tell me anything about her. But judging by the power... maybe?\"\nVice Admiral De’an wiped his face in exasperation. He walked over and squatted in front of Arix, speaking in a gentle tone, \"Arix, right? Is your psychic power really Supergiant+?\"\nArix, squatting on the ground, nodded obediently.\n\"Can you help us subdue the admiral?\" Vice Admiral De’an asked, hopeful.\nArix nodded quickly. \"Sure, it won’t be as hard as you said.\"\nVice Admiral De’an shut his mouth in shock.\nGreat, just today, he was outdone by a little cub.\n\"Is that so... Well, we appreciate it. Time is of the essence. Can we start now?\" Vice Admiral De’an quickly regained his composure and looked at Arix for her consent.\n\"Okay,\" Arix nodded.\nWithout further ado, Vice Admiral De’an picked Arix up and headed toward the confinement room. The other officers exchanged glances and followed, even Sunak, who had been on the ground, got up and trailed behind.\nThey all gathered at the door of the confinement room, their eyes turning to Arix. She gave a firm nod, signaling them to open the door.\nVice Admiral De’an took a deep breath. Then, without hesitation, he flung the door open. Immediately, a terrifying surge of psychic power burst out from the room.\nThe officers instinctively recoiled, but at that moment, Arix suddenly flew out of Vice Admiral De’an’s arms, her small wings flapping.\nA wave of psychic power, equally strong as that from the confinement room, erupted from Arix. In the blink of an eye, she formed a golden psychic power shield in front of her, blocking the incoming attack.\nA terrifying roar echoed from the confinement room, and moments later, a large tiger emerged, its blood-red eyes fixed intently on Arix and the others.\n\"Scion?\" Arix tentatively called out, hoping there was still some consciousness left in Scion.\nScion’s response was to open his massive jaws and lunge at them.\n’Alright, no need to hold back now,’\nArix thought to herself.\nArix initially felt embarrassed about being harsh to someone she knew, but seeing that Scion had lost all reason, she felt no guilt about taking action.\nThe battle between them was completely one-sided. Although Arix was tiny, not even as big as Scion’s head, she easily overpowered him.\nBy the end, she was standing triumphantly on Scion’s head, looking down at him with satisfaction as he lay bound by her psychic power.\nThe little cub scolded him like an unruly patient, puffing up her cheeks and saying, \"When you’re sick, you should behave. Only bad kids cause trouble for others.\"\nOutside the confinement room, the Empire officers watched with complicated feelings as their admiral was reprimanded by a little cub.\nHowever, instead of intervening, they collectively and eagerly pulled out their opticomputers to record the scene. This was prime blackmail material!\nAfter they had recorded enough things, Vice Admiral De’an and the others finally turned their gaze to Sunak, subtly hinting that he should step in. After all, Scion was their admiral, and some dignity had to be preserved.",

      "content": "Chapter 104: Psychic Healer\nSunak took a deep breath, rolling his eyes before clearing his throat. \"Arix, that’s enough. Let the medics check on the admiral now,\" he instructed.\nArix, hearing Sunak, finally stepped away from Scion and obediently left the confinement room.\n\"Sunak, still need a Psychic Healer?\" Arix asked, sounding casual.\n\"Where did you get...,\" Sunak began, but before he could finish, Rear Admiral Frepe clamped a hand over his mouth and dragged him away.\nVice Admiral De’an nodded approvingly at Frepe. Then he turned to Arix with a smile that hinted at mischief. \"Do you have a Psychic Healer?\" he asked gently.\n\"Nope,\" Arix replied, shaking her head honestly.\nVice Admiral De’an was momentarily at a loss. This wasn’t part of the plan. The next step should’ve been this young one pulling out a psychic healing potion to save their admiral. It made perfect sense. But reality, it seemed, had other ideas.\nIt was silly to pin all hopes on a cub, De’an realized. Just as he was about to give up, Arix spoke again.\n\"I don’t have one, but I can make a psychic power healing potion. As long as I have the necessary ingredients, I can whip it up,\" Arix said nonchalantly, as if talking about making lunch.\nThe Empire officers were stunned. Psychic power healing potions were incredibly rare, often bought at outrageous prices from black markets or auctions. Yet, here was this kid claiming she could make one!\nAll eyes turned to Sunak, seeking confirmation.\n\"Captain Sunak, is she serious? Frepe, let him speak,\" De’an ordered.\nFrepe, realizing his error, quickly released Sunak and apologized, \"Sorry, buddy, forgot myself there.\"\nSunak just stared back, speechless. It seemed like they wanted him to talk when it suited them, but gagged him when it didn’t...\nThe Empire officers, feeling Sunak’s accusing gaze, shifted uncomfortably. Some stared at the floor, others at the ceiling, while a few coughed awkwardly and turned away.\nSunak rolled his eyes, clearly frustrated. \"I’ve known my niece for about as long as you guys have,\" he muttered irritably. \"How would I know? But I heard the person who developed the Psychic Healer is named A... Arix, is that really you?\"\nArix looked around at the incredulous faces and asked, puzzled, \"Sunak, you know my name. Didn’t you realize it yet?\"\nSunak felt like shouting,\n’How was I supposed to know a little cub like you could create the Psychic Healer!’\nBut before he could say anything, the other Empire officers eagerly pushed him aside.\nVice Admiral De’an’s eyes lit up as he picked Arix up, and the officers crowded around her, all clamoring for the potion.\n\"Little Arix, when you have time, could you make some for me too?\" Vice Admiral De’an asked with a kind, gentle smile.\nArix nodded without hesitation, finding it an easy task.\nSeeing this, the other officers quickly started flattering her, also asking for the potion. Arix agreed to each of them, winning their hearts and instantly becoming the small cub everyone’s fond of.\nAfter sending Arix into the lab, Vice Admiral De’an and the others suddenly turned their heads in unison, staring quietly at Sunak.\nSunak was taken aback. \"You’re scaring me, guys! Please don’t look at me like that!\"\nClearing his throat, Vice Admiral De’an spoke seriously, \"Sunak, don’t you think we should discuss the cub’s identity?\"\n\"Yeah, let’s not even talk about her Supergiant+ psychic power. Just consider the Psychic Healer potion. If Arix is indeed the one who developed it, the Alliance must be crazy to let such a treasure run around freely,\" commented Lieutenant Commander Lancelot in amazement.\n\"The Alliance is so stupid on this. I suggest Arix switch her nationality to us,\" Captain Chris’s eyes gleamed, thinking it was a great idea.\n\"Exactly, and Arix is originally a therian cub. Her bloodline is pure. How could she be one of the Alliance people? She’s definitely one of us! The Alliance can’t possibly have a therian cub, can they?\" Rear Admiral Frepe’s confidence grew as he spoke, and the other officers nodded in agreement.\nSunak sighed deeply, feeling the absurdity of the situation. \"Arix’s mother is the daughter of His Holiness, and her father is a Vice Admiral of the Alliance.\"\n\"His Holiness? As in His Holiness of the Empire? Well, that just made things even easier. As for her father... a Vice Admiral, you say? That’s nothing to be afraid of. I’m a Vice Admiral too,\" Vice Admiral De’an puffed out his chest, letting out a proud humph.\n\"But, Arix’s grandfather is the admiral of the Fifth Legion of the Alliance, commanding an entire legion’s worth of soldiers. Moreover, he is the current head of the Kering family, one of the five major families. The five families have always stuck together. Do you think you can take on all five families?\" Sunak said as his voice grew increasingly sympathetic.\nThe more beautiful their earlier visions, the harsher the reality they now faced.\nSunak’s words deflated the Empire officers. The air became instantly gloomy and depressive.\nIf it were just about taking a Vice Admiral’s cub, they might have had a chance. But taking on the cub of one of the five major families? Forget it.\nWith their spirits clearly dampened, Sunak began to wonder if he’d been too harsh. After all, it was natural to like such a cute cub.\nScratching his head, Sunak tentatively offered some comfort, \"Arix isn’t from the Empire, but don’t forget, her mother is one of our tigermen. So, doesn’t that make the Tiger Legion her home?\"\nVice Admiral De’an’s eyes widened, a spark of hope reigniting.\nRear Admiral Frepe’s face lit up. Captain Chris’s excitement returned, and Lieutenant Commander Lancelot’s jaw dropped in realization.\n\"That’s a wake-up call!\" The Empire officers suddenly got excited.\n\"Yes, she’s definitely ours,\" Rear Admiral Frepe’s eyes sparkled, and he stood up straight with renewed energy.\n\"Who would’ve thought, at such a crucial moment, Sunak, your brain would work so well. Well done! You really did a good job this time,\" Vice Admiral De’an said with a smile, giving Sunak a pat on the shoulder.\nCaptain Chris and Lieutenant Commander Lancelot also gave Sunak a thumbs up, showing their admiration.\nSunak, not expecting such praise for his casual remark, scratched the back of his head shyly and joined in the laughter.\n...",

      "content": "Chapter 105: Saving Scion\nIn the Pharmacy Room, Arix, with a serious expression, was carefully mixing medical ingredients for Scion.\nScion’s psychic power had almost reached Supergiant+ level, so ordinary psychic power healing potions couldn’t completely cure him.\nArix had stepped on his head earlier, and it wasn’t for fun. She was closely examining his condition, so she could provide the right treatment.\nThe only hassle was that Arix was still in her beast form, which meant she had to hop around to select medical ingredients instead of simply reaching out to grab them. Her hands had turned into small paws, making it hard to grasp anything.\nWith a deep sigh, Arix resignedly used her psychic power and her mouth alternatively, to carry each ingredient to the lab table one by one.\nIf someone were watching, he’d probably be charmed to death by the cute sight. Nothing could be more adorable than a little creature seriously at work.\nArix placd the last ingredient on the table and rechecked everything to ensure it was correct. Then, she finally let out a sigh of relief. Now all that was left was the catalyst.\nThinking of this, Arix turned to look at Cupid, who was digesting the Insectoid Core on the table.\n\"Cupid, is the Supergiant-Class Arix Crystal ready?\" Arix asked.\n\"It’s ready,\" Cupid replied with a cute nod, then he walked over to Arix and squatted like a cat doing its business.\nSoon, a fiery red Arix Crystal, still steaming, was placed on the lab table by Cupid.\n\"Thanks, Cupid,\" Arix said, controlling the twitching at the corner of her mouth as she thanked Cupid for the fresh crystal. Fortunately, she wasn’t the one who had to drink the potion, so there was no psychological trauma.\nBut Arix silently vowed to protect her psychic world, making sure she never had to drink a psychic power healing potion.\nWith all the necessary ingredients ready, Arix took out a box from her Space Button that Vice Admiral De’an had given her earlier.\n\"Cupid, could you help with these cores too?\" Arix asked gently.\n\"Sure thing!\" Cupid’s eyes lit up at the sight of the Insectoid Cores. He eagerly ran over, picked up a core from the box.\nThen, he lazily lay on the table, holding the core in his little paws and munching happily.\nArix watched Cupid with a fond smile. Moments later, she turned her attention back to making the psychic power healing potion. Due to the inconveniences of her therian form, she decided to use her psychic power to control the medical ingredients and equipment.\nLuckily, she had practiced materializing her psychic power before, so she was quite skilled at controlling it.\nShe crushed the necessary ingredients, put them into test tubes, boiled them for the required time.\nShe used her psychic power to separate impurities from the potion, and extracted the pure liquid. She repeated this process for each ingredient.\nFinally, Arix poured the liquidized Arix Crystal into the mixture.\nAs the light blue potion turned pitch black, she smiled with satisfaction.\nShe poured the potion into a vial and sealed it. Tadaaa—the healing potion was complete.\n\"Cupid, we’re heading out. I’ll put the cores away for now. You can have them later in the resting room,\" Arix said gently to Cupid.\n\"Okay,\" Cupid replied cutely. He then transformed into a beam of fiery red psychic power and returned to Arix’s psychic world.\nArix put the Insectoid Core and the Arix Crystal back into her Space Button. Then, carrying the potion vial in her mouth, she jumped off the table like a cotton ball and walked to the door.\nShe leaped up, used her front paw to unlock the door, and walked out of the pharmacy room.\n\"Finally out, little Arix! You did great.\"\nVice Admiral De’an and the others gathered around as soon as the door opened, showering Arix with concern and warmth.\nArix felt a bit overwhelmed, sensing their unusual enthusiasm.\nShe didn’t think much of it, assuming they were just thrilled about the potion.\nArix placed the vial on the floor and said in a cute voice, \"The potion is ready. Let’s give it to the admiral quickly.\"\n\"Yes, yes, let’s not delay,\" Vice Admiral De’an said, scooping Arix into his arms and holding her close.\nCaptain Chris picked up the psychic power healing potion, and together they hurried towards the confinement room.\nFollowing behind, Lieutenant Commander Lancelot had an odd expression since he first saw the potion. He had once seen a psychic power healing potion, and he remembered it being light blue. Though he had heard that stronger potions were darker, he had never seen one turn black.\n’Is the potion supposed to be this color?’\nThe more Lancelot thought about it, the more worried he became.\nHe discreetly grabbed Sunak’s wrist and, after some serious consideration, he whispered, \"Sunak, do you think there’s a problem with this potion? I remember when I saw it in some Alliance news, the psychic healer’s potion was light blue...\"\nSunak had been feeling uneasy from the start. Hearing Lancelot’s concern only made his anxiety worse, causing his eye to twitch nervously. However, since this potion was made by his dear niece, Sunak couldn’t let anyone doubt her abilities.\nHe swallowed to ease his tension and pretended to speak with a certain tone, \"My niece is the one who developed the psychic power healing potion. Now, other Alliance chemists can make the potion too, but they can’t do it with some ingredient Arix provide. She invented the potion, so it’s not surprising that her version is unique.\"\n\"Really? Well, that does make sense. Considering she’s the researcher behind the psychic healer’s potion, it’s normal for her creation to be different,\" Lancelot replied, nodding in sudden understanding and belief.\nSunak, hiding his guilt, could only muster a weak smile and nod in agreement.\nAt the confinement room door, Vice Admiral De’an and Arix exchanged a resolute glance and nodded at each other.\nDetermined, De’an stepped into the confinement room. The other Empire officers, seeing this, exchanged nervous looks before quickly following inside.",

      "content": "Chapter 106: Fighting Back\nThe fierce tiger in the confinement room had vanished. Maybe it was Arix’s psychic power that suppressed it, giving Scion a moment of clarity to return to his human form.\nThe officers of the Empire, seeing their admiral back to normal, were thrilled. They hurried over, showering him with concern and care.\n\"Admiral Scion, are you alright? How are you feeling?\" Captain Chris asked, his voice a mix of excitement and worry.\n\"I’m fine. What’s going on outside?\" Scion wasn’t worried about himself. He was more concerned about the battle outside.\n\"Vice Admiral Klaus is in the control room, directing the mecha squads and fleets. Luckily, things are under control for now, so there’s no immediate danger,\" Captain Chris explained with respect.\n\"Good to know,\" Scion replied calmly.\n\"Admiral Scion, why did your psychic power go out of control so suddenly? There were no signs, and we still have no clues,\" Vice Admiral De’an asked, his voice tight with concern.\n\"No need to investigate. I know who did it, and I’ll handle them personally when we return,\" Scion said, his eyes cold and his tone menacing.\n\"Understood,\" Vice Admiral De’an hesitated, wanting to avenge the admiral himself, but seeing Scion’s resolve, he reluctantly agreed.\n\"Arix, since Admiral Scion is awake, you can withdraw your psychic power now,\" Vice Admiral De’an said, patting Arix on the head.\n\"Okay!\" Arix moved her tiny paws, and pulled it back into her psychic world.\nScion, finally free, looked at the little cub in surprise.\n’If I guessed right, this seem like Supergiant+ level psychic power.’\nHe couldn’t help but wonder if the Alliance was overconfident in the Empire, not fearing they might exploit this situation.\n\"Admiral, here’s the potion to treat your psychic power outbreak. Please drink it now so we can all relax,\" Captain Chris remembered the task at hand, quickly handing the psychic power treatment potion to Scion, his tone full of concern.\n\"Who made this potion?\" Scion took the potion, surprised. There shouldn’t be any psychic power treatment potions in the legion at this time.\n\"Little Arix personally made it for you,\" Captain Chris emphasized the word \"personally,\" highlighting Arix’s effort.\nScion’s surprise deepened. Raising an eyebrow, he looked at Arix and smiled, \"Thank you, Arix.\"\nAs Scion expressed his gratitude, a rare smile appeared, making him look as elegant and beautiful as a snowdrop on a mountaintop.\n\"You’re welcome, you’re welcome,\" Arix blushed, hiding in Vice Admiral De’an’s arms, shyly waving his paw.\nAfter thanking Arix with a smile, Scion finally looked down at the psychic power treatment potion in his hand.\nScion first opened the potion’s seal and took a sniff. The strong, pungent smell made him catch his breath.\nAfter a brief hesitation, he decided to drink it all in one go.\nAt first, Scion only frowned, finding the taste peculiar. But within seconds, his face turned an alarming shade of green. The bitter and astringent flavor hit him like a wave, making his mind feel muddled, almost like experiencing electroshock therapy.\nScion covered his face with his hands, struggling to suppress a groan. It took him a good while to recover and lower his hands. If he hadn’t felt the potion working in his psychic world, he would have thought he’d ingested a biochemical weapon instead of a treatment potion.\n\"Admiral, what’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell?\" Captain Chris asked, noticing the change in Scion’s expression.\nScion shook his head and sighed. \"I’m fine. I just realized that there are things in this world more terrifying than death.\"\n\"Huh? What could be more terrifying than death?\" Captain Chris was stunned. Did the admiral mean the insectoids? But they didn’t seem scarier than death.\nScion didn’t answer Chris’s question directly. Instead, he said something cryptic that left Captain Chris puzzled for a long time. \"You’ll understand once you drink Arix’s potion,\" Scion remarked calmly, though his eyes showed a trace of lingering fear.\nCaptain Chris was so confused.\n’Can the cub’s potion actually make someone smarter? If so, I definitely want to try it!’\nCaptain Chris’s eyes lit up at the thought.\nAfter a while, Scion stood up, his voice icy as he said, \"We’ve delayed long enough. It’s time to complete our mission.\"\nVice Admiral De’an and the others instantly looked excited, smiling broadly. They placed their right hands over their chests and bowed respectfully. Then, in unison, they shouted, \"Yes, sir!\"\nBefore the officers set out, Arix, looking pitiful, was handed over by Vice Admiral De’an to another Empire soldier.\n\"Arix, we’re going to fight the insectoids next. You’re still a cub, so it’s too dangerous for you to come with us. Be good and wait for us in the rest area,\" Vice Admiral De’an gently coaxed.\nArix pouted, turning his head away in displeasure with a small humph.\nVice Admiral De’an was about to say more when Scion interrupted. \"Arix, do you want to come to the front lines with me?\" Scion asked casually.\nBefore Arix could answer, the Empire officers erupted in protest.\n\"Sir, I don’t think that would be a good idea. Arix is still too young. Children shouldn’t be exposed to such things,\" Vice Admiral De’an, slipping into his protective brother mode, argued.\n\"Yeah, if something happens, my cousin will kill me,\" Sunak added to the opposition.\n\"Little Arix is indeed still too young,\" even Captain Chris, who usually followed the admiral’s orders without question, hesitated this time.\nScion remained calm despite everyone’s concerns. He said lightly, \"No need to worry, she’s stronger than all of you.\"\nThe Empire officers, feeling both speechless and slightly humiliated by the implication, stood in stunned silence.\nAs the Empire officers felt in utter silence, Arix almost couldn’t help laughing out.\nThen, without hesitation, she leaped into Scion’s arms, exclaiming excitedly, \"Can I come with you when you pilot the mecha later, sir?\"\nScion glanced down at the eager youngster in his arms, a small smile playing on his lips. \"Sure.\"\n\"Yeah! This is awesome. You’re so nice to me, even nicer than Drexel!\" Arix shouted, her voice brimming with excitement and joy.\nScion kept smiling, gently patting Arix’s small head before carrying her outside.\nBehind them, the Empire officers exchanged glances, shaking their heads or shrugging helplessly, and finally, they resigned themselves to following along.",

      "content": "Chapter 107: Mecha Samurai\nOn the deck of the starship carrier, Arix was nestled in Scion’s arms. She looked up in awe at the battlefield between the Empire and the insectoids.\nThrough the energy shield of the starship carrier, Arix saw countless insectoids swarming toward the fleet in the vast expanse of space.\nCompared to the few small insectoids she had seen before, the ones outside the energy shield were like their parents. They weren’t just terrifyingly numerous; they were also several times larger. The most frightening sight was three insectoids, each as large as the starship carrier.\nJust how big was the starship carrier? It was the size of hundreds of football fields!\nIf the insectoid swarm were like green beans, then these three special insectoids were like eggs in comparison—completely unmatched by the regular insectoids.\nAfter marveling at the insectoids, Arix turned her gaze toward the Empire.\nIf the insectoids won by sheer numbers, the Empire relied on quality. The Empire’s main combat force was the starship carrier. Surrounding it were nine slightly smaller military warships, which operated under the starship carrier’s command.\nThese warships could search, track, lock onto, and attack insectoids within a range of several thousand kilometers. Their powerful particle beam weapons and super electromagnetic cannons could wipe out thousands of insectoids in a single shot.\nThe only downside was that the long charging time for these weapons allowed some insectoids to breach the starship carrier’s protective circle.\nThis was when the mechas came into play.\nIn the starry space, over a thousand mechas were fighting. Pilots wielded heavy swords, pulse guns, and various other weapons, fiercely killing any insectoid that entered the starship carrier’s protection zone.\nWatching the mecha pilots battle the insectoids with such fervor, Arix felt her own blood pumping. She couldn’t wait to pilot a mecha herself and charge into the insectoid swarm.\nUnfortunately, she was still just a student and hadn’t even started her mecha pilot classes.\nFighting in a mecha, or even controlling one to walk, was out of the question for her right now.\nThe more Arix thought about it, the more disheartened she became, her ears drooping in frustration.\n\"Arix, are you scared?\" Scion noticed the youngling’s low spirits and asked with a slight smile.\nArix shook her head, replying in her soft, childish voice, \"Not scared, just very curious. I’ve never seen such big insectoids before.\"\n\"Then let’s take a closer look,\" Scion said mysteriously.\nHe retrieved a pure white mecha from his Space Button. The mecha was about 15 meters tall and holding a long sword.\nArix gazed at the towering mecha, swallowing hard in excitement before asking eagerly, \"Scion, is this your mecha? What’s his name?\"\nScion’s expression softened as he looked at the mecha. \"His name is Samurai. He’s been with me since I was little. He’s my important partner.\"\n\"Scion, you’re so lucky! I want a mecha that can be my partner too,\" Arix said enviously, nearly drooling with excitement.\nScion chuckled and patted Arix’s furry little head. Then he looked up at the mecha and said, \"Samurai, get ready for battle.\"\nAs soon as Scion finished speaking, the massive mecha moved, kneeling down and extending his free hand towards Scion.\n\"It’s an honor to fight with you, master,\" Samurai’s mechanical voice carried a knightly reverence.\nScion nodded and, holding Arix, stepped into Samurai’s hand.\nOnce they were securely in place, Samurai carefully lifted them into the cockpit located in his chest. Standing tall, Samurai then turned his gaze towards the distant insectoids.\nInside the mecha’s cockpit, Arix nestled obediently in Scion’s arms, eyes wide with excitement as she took in the surroundings.\nThe cockpit resembled an airplane’s, though it was smaller and filled with virtual buttons, giving it a much more high-tech feel. Unlike an airplane, the front wasn’t transparent glass but a virtual screen, where Samurai’s avatar now appeared.\nTo Arix’s surprise, Samurai’s avatar looked like a child of about five years old. The avatar stared at Arix curiously, his voice now youthful and inquisitive, quite different from the mature tone outside. \"Master, who is this little one?\"\nScion’s gaze softened as he replied, \"This is Arix. She’s a friend and wants to learn about the mecha.\"\nArix smiled shyly at the AI. \"Hi, Samurai! You’re really cool!\"\nSamurai beamed, his childlike enthusiasm evident. \"Hello, Arix! It’s nice to meet you. Are you ready to see what a mecha can do?\"\nArix’s eyes sparkled with excitement as she nodded eagerly. \"Yes, please!\"\nScion chuckled at her enthusiasm. \"Alright, Samurai. Let’s show her the ropes.\"\nWith that, Samurai activated his systems, the cockpit lighting up with displays and controls.\nArix watched in awe as the mecha moved with precision and power, his every step shaking the ground beneath them.\nScion expertly maneuvered Samurai, demonstrating basic movements and combat techniques.\nArix soaked in every moment, her initial frustration forgotten as she marveled at the mecha’s capabilities.\nThis was just the beginning of her journey, and she couldn’t wait to take her own steps towards becoming a mecha pilot.\nBut before Scion could respond, Samurai seemed to have a revelation. \"Oh, I get it! This is your little cub, right, Master?! But wait, Master, when did you get a mate? How come I didn’t know?\"\nA vein throbbed on Scion’s forehead, his childhood friend bonds seemingly evaporating. He coldly uttered one word, \"Mute.\"\nSamurai was muted immediately.\n’Master! Are you angry? So I am right! She IS you little cub!’\nAlthough the language system was disabled, Samurai continued to spam messages on the virtual screen:\n\"Master, master, I was wrong.\"\n\"Master, please turn the voice system back on, I won’t talk nonsense anymore.\"\n\"Master, do you have a new cub and don’t want your old Samurai anymore?\"\n\"Master! Master...\"\nSeeing the continuous barrage of messages, Arix burst into giggles. \"Scion, I think Samurai knows he was wrong. How about turning the voice system back on?\"\nSamurai looked at Arix gratefully, then made a pitiful face, as if to say,\n’If you don’t unmute me, I’ll cry.’\nWith two cute faces pleading, Scion rubbed his temples in frustration. He then warned Samurai coldly, \"If you speak nonsense again, I’ll remove your voice system entirely and make you a mute mecha.\"\nOn the virtual screen, Samurai finally looked scared, shrinking back and miming a gesture of sealing its lips.",

      "content": "Chapter 108: First Mecha Experience\nSamurai was crafted by the mecha master, Valport. When he made it, Valport noticed Scion was just a kid. So, he made Samurai’s avatar to match Scion’s age, hoping it would be a buddy for him.\nYears flew by. Scion grew older, but Samurai stayed the same—a cheeky, chatty kid. Scion thought about asking Master Valport to tweak Samurai’s avartar, but there was something special about the little guy.\nFrom a trusted childhood friend to someone Scion saw as a younger brother, Samurai had been a constant. Sometimes, Scion even felt like a worried parent.\nSamurai had been with him through the mundane and the thrilling, protecting him all the while. Their bond, forged over years, was unbreakable.\nScion had decided to keep Samurai just as it was, so regrets were pointless. He wasn’t one to linger on what-ifs. With a deep sigh and a resigned smile, he said, \"Unmute.\"\nOnce the language system kicked in, Samurai straightened up. It knew Scion didn’t tolerate nonsense.\nSamurai grumbled to itself but then spotted the little kid in Scion’s arms. Curious, he asked, \"Hey, little one, who are you?\"\n\"Hello Samurai, I’m Arix. It’s great to meet you. I may need your help today,\" Arix said, eyes shining with excitement and a bit of shyness.\nDon’t be fooled by Samurai’s childish looks—it was a real Supergiant-Class mecha. Most people never even saw one. Even military students had to wait until they graduated and joined a legion to see a real one.\n\"Don’t worry, I’ll protect you today,\" Samurai declared, chest puffed out in a big brotherly way.\n\"Thank you, Samurai,\" Arix replied, full of admiration.\n\"Hahaha! No problem at all!\" Samurai laughed, proud as could be.\n\"Alright, time to start the battle,\" Scion interrupted. He knew these two could chat forever and never get to the fighting part.\n\"Okay, let’s go! Time to fight the insectoids. Master, get ready, we’re establishing the psychic link,\" Samurai said, buzzing with excitement at another chance to shine.\nArix’s eyes sparkled, as she was about to see a Supergiant-Class mecha in action. If her classmates at the Hecaris Military Academy knew, they’d be so jealous.\nScion wasted no time. He placed Arix on his shoulder and sat in the pilot seat. Slowly, he channeled his psychic power into a larger button on the control panel until it lit up.\nScion closed his eyes and waited. As he connected his psychic power to the mecha, Samurai’s serious voice filled the cockpit.\n\"System, connected.\"\n\"Energy, sufficient.\"\n\"Power, normal!\"\n\"Green across the board.\"\n...\n\"Mecha self-check complete, all systems go. Master, I’m ready for the battle.\"\nScion opened his eyes slowly. The mecha began to move, whirlwinds forming under his feet, propelling him toward the insectoids.\nWhen they reached a special trio of insectoids, Samurai halted.\nLike a real samurai, the mecha raised its longsword high and swung it down. A light blade, hundreds of meters long, slashed through the air. The massive insectoid in the middle was sliced in half before it could react.\nThe other two special insectoids, seemingly intelligent, screeched angrily at their companion’s death. Countless other insectoids swarmed toward the pure white mecha as if commanded.\nFacing the oncoming wave, Scion remained calm. He activated the mecha’s energy shield, blocking the attacks.\nHe then maneuvered Samurai to leap into the air, performing a sword flourish.\nA light blade, 50 meters wide, swept through the air, clearing a 100-meter radius of insectoids in front of the mecha!\nA single strike from Scion was as powerful as a particle beam. Arix, watching, finally understood the true might of a mecha. No wonder pilots were revered. A single pilot could rival a battleship.\nOf course, it was also because Scion was insanely powerful.\n...\nIn the starship carrier’s Control Room...\nWith the admiral on the battlefield, Vice Admirals Klaus and De’an felt at ease, so they left command to other officers. They watched the real-time battle feed side by side.\nSeeing Scion clear a 100-meter radius of insectoids with one strike, they were awestruck.\n\"No wonder he’s the admiral. His destructive power is incredible,\" Klaus admired.\n\"The admiral has always been strong, and Samurai seems even stronger now. Valport must have made some special modifications,\" De’an said, enviously touching his Space Button, which housed his own mecha.\n\"Well, Scion is Valport’s godson, after all. Too bad Valport isn’t taking any more godsons, or I’d try my luck!\" Klaus, now over fifty, said with a mischievous grin, stroking his chin.\nDe’an Vice Admiral rolled his eyes and scoffed, \"Let’s not even go there. You’re ten years older than Valport. Think you can compare to our admiral in looks? He became Valport’s godson. You? You’d be lucky to be his janitor.\"\nKlaus Vice Admiral, feeling indignant, huffed, \"What if Valport appreciates my humor? Looks are temporary. A hundred years from now, we’re all just bones.\"\n\"Even as bones, Admiral Scion’s will look better than yours,\" De’an Vice Admiral sneered.\n\"Hey, De’an! Are you looking for a fight today? Let’s step outside and see who can kill more insectoids,\" Klaus Vice Admiral challenged, rolling up his sleeves.\n\"Bring it on! Like I’m afraid of you!\" De’an Vice Admiral shot back, taking off his neatly pressed coat.\nThe Empire officers in the control room inwardly rolled their eyes, used to these two high-ranking officers bickering over the smallest disagreements. As long as they didn’t cause trouble for everyone else, it was a blessing.\nChapter 123 Competition\nBefore they could leave, Vice Admirals Klaus and De’an suddenly remembered something crucial—As Scion wasn’t in the Control Room, they had to stay behind to keep everything running smoothly.\nThis posed a problem. If they didn’t compete today, they’d feel uneasy, but they couldn’t abandon their sense of duty either. Sharing a quick glance, they both had the same idea.\n\"Captain Chris!\" Vice Admiral Klaus called out sharply.\n\"Captain Sunak!\" Vice Admiral De’an echoed.\nCaptain Chris and Captain Sunak exchanged nervous looks. Reluctantly responding, they heard exactly what they feared.\n\"You two go out and kill insectoids. Whoever kills the most gets this Star-Class energy stone,\" Klaus declared, showing a purple crystal.\n\"Hah, getting cheap on us? I have a Subgiant-Class healing potion for the winner,\" De’an added, flaunting a green potion.\nCaptain Chris was not thrilled. He didn’t really want it.\nHowever, Sunak’s eyes lit up at the sight of the prizes. He wasn’t interested in them for himself, but he knew Arix would love them. Imagining her sweet, excited face made him grin.\nHis sudden laughter drew the attention of almost everyone in the control room. They likely thought he had lost it. Captain Chris looked at him like he was crazy.\nEveryone knew this competition wasn’t a joke. The loser would endure intense training under the victorious Vice Admiral, which usually ended in some painful \"friendly sparring.\"\nMany soldiers in the Tiger Legion had faced this \"friendly sparring.\", often leaving with bruised faces.\nBut De’an didn’t mind. He figured if Sunak was laughing, he must be confident, which meant De’an was destined to win.\nVice Admiral De’an chuckled, but Vice Admiral Klaus wasn’t amused. He turned to Captain Chris, narrowing his eyes with a creepy yet kind smile, staring silently.\nThe message was clear.\nCaptain Chris felt a shiver down his spine and quickly stood at attention, promising to Klaus, \"Sir, I won’t let you down.\"\n\"Good! That’s the spirit of a true warrior of the Empire. I have high hopes for you,\" Vice Admiral Klaus finally smiled and nodded.\nCaptain Chris cursed inwardly but kept a polite smile on his face.\nSunak and Chris placed their right hands over their chests, saluting Vice Admirals Klaus and De’an with the traditional Empire gesture before leaving the main control room together.\nAs soon as they stepped out, Captain Chris’s smile vanished. He turned to Sunak, curiosity clear in his voice. \"Sunak, what were you thinking back there, smiling so happily?\"\n\"That’s a secret,\" Sunak replied, chuckling playfully.\nChris’s curiosity only deepened. He raised an eyebrow and guessed, \"Does it have something to do with your little niece? Are you planning to give her the spoils of victory?\"\nSunak was annoyed. He hated Chris for being so smart sometimes. Honestly, the most frustrating people weren’t just the smart ones or the strong ones. It was the ones who do both. They were smart and strong, and that was just infuriating!\nSeeing Sunak’s annoyed expression, Chris knew he had guessed right. His smile turned mischievous. \"I thought this would be boring, but now it seems interesting. Just imagine your niece receiving the gift and sweetly calling me ’Uncle Chris.’ That would be quite delightful.\"\nSunak was furious. It was bad enough that Scion always tried to steal Arix’s attention, and he couldn’t do anything about it. But now, a fellow officer was trying to do the same? No way!\nWith a cold laugh, Sunak retorted, \"Already dreaming of victory? It’s been a while since you’ve been away from the admiral and piloted a mecha. Don’t end up needing my help halfway through the battle with the insectoids. That would be quite embarrassing.\"\nChris shot back, \"Funny, I could say the same to you. Remember who saved you when you were running for your life from an insectoid? If it weren’t for me, you might already be fertilizer for some flower garden.\"\n\"Bah!\" Sunak glared at Chris.\n\"Hmph!\" Chris lifted his chin arrogantly and snorted at Sunak.\nThe two continued bickering as they made their way to the carrier’s deck, where they quickly deployed their mechas. They both scrambled into their mecha cockpits like mice evading a cat.",

      "content": "Chapter 109: Cassian In Danger\nMeanwhile, Samurai, having just dispatched three leading insectoids, was returning to the starship carrier. As he landed on the deck, two Star-Class mechas appeared nearby.\nScion emerged from the cockpit, holding Arix. He glanced disinterestedly at the two mechas before turning away.\nAfter landing, he put Samurai back into his Space Button and headed toward the carrier’s interior.\n\"Those two getting into their mechas just now, were they Sunak and Captain Chris? Are they also going to hunt insectoids?\" Arix asked, looking up adorably.\nScion ruffled Arix’s hair, his tone carrying a hint of something deeper. \"Something like that.\"\n\"Will it be dangerous?\" Arix asked, worried about Sunak.\n\"No,\" Scion replied calmly, reassuring her.\n\"Then it’s fine,\" Arix said, feeling relieved. Suddenly, she felt incredibly sleepy. Ever since she had turned into a youngling, she had been getting sleepy very easily. Sometimes, she even felt drowsy halfway through a meal.\nA wave of sleepiness hit her hard, and her brain started to shut down. She yawned, adjusted herself into a comfortable position, and nestled into Scion’s arms, falling into a deep sleep almost instantly.\nAs Scion continued walking, he suddenly heard the soft sounds of her snores. He glanced down to see the little one sleeping adorably and vulnerably in his arms.\nThis sight brought a gentle smile to his lips, and his heart softened. His steps became lighter, as if trying not to disturb her slumber.\nChapter 124 Imagination\nThe sound of laughter from outside disturbed Arix’s sleep, waking her up.\nStill feeling groggy, she sat up halfway, using her furry paws to rub her eyes.\nAs she became more alert, she noticed she was back in the lounge. Remembering the face she saw before falling asleep, she guessed it was Scion who had brought her back.\nJust as she thought of him, Scion pushed the door open and walked in.\n\"Scion, what are you doing here? Is everything okay?\" Arix tilted her head, letting out a puzzled whimper.\nUsually, Scion was busy, and it was Arix who sought him out when she was bored. This was the first time he came to see her on his own.\n\"Sunak had something to take care of and asked me to look after you for a few days,\" Scion said. He silently told a little white lie, as he remembered the two people with bruised faces still soaking in the treatment pods.\n\"Oh,\" Arix thought Sunak had gone on a mission and didn’t think much of it.\nSeeing that she had just woken up, Scion came over and picked her up. Then, he brought her to the bathroom, helping her brush her teeth and wash her face.\nArix wanted to do it herself but, seeing Scion’s stern face, she kept quiet. She decided to just let it be—after all, she was just a cub now.\nAfter freshening up, Arix returned to her bed, only to find two items placed in front of her. One was a Star-Class energy stone, and the other was a Subgiant-Class healing potion.\n\"What are these for?\" Arix asked, confused about why Scion had brought these things and placed them before her like gifts.\n\"The energy stone is a gift from Captain Chris, and the potion is from Sunak,\" Scion explained, seeing the little cub’s confusion.\nHearing that Captain Chris had sent it, Arix didn’t understand why they would give her gifts for no reason, but she didn’t question it and accepted them.\nShe thought she could make some psychic power healing potions later and give them as return gifts.\nShe put the presents into her Space Button and then heard the laughter from outside the room again. \"Is there something good happening today? Everyone seems really happy,\" Arix asked curiously.\n\"Yes, there is. Tonight, there’s a celebration. Arix, do you want to go and see?\" Scion gently patted Arix’s fluffy little head, his eyes soft.\n\"Sure, but before we go, I want to stop by the lab,\" Arix remembered a promise she had made and thought it would be nice to add to the celebration with her contribution.\n\"Alright,\" Scion said without asking why. He then simply picked Arix up and headed straight to the lab.\nArix worked quickly this time, managing to make 50 psychic power healing potions within about an hour. She put the potions into her Space Button, pushed open the door, and walked out.\nBut as soon as she stepped out, she froze. Besides Scion waiting for her, there was a handsome man dressed in an expensive suit, arguing with Scion.\n\"I don’t feel comfortable letting her go alone. We’ll be at the Imperial Nexus in a few days; she can go then,\" Scion said coldly, rejecting the man without room for debate.\n\"But this is His Highness! How can we make His Highness wait?\" Duke Glendale was furious, looking like he wanted to punch someone, though he knew he wouldn’t want to beat Scion.\n\"That doesn’t mean we can let our tiger cub take risks,\" Scion replied, still indifferent.\n\"How could you...\" Duke Glendale pointed at Scion, looking like he wanted to curse but didn’t dare. It was a pitiful sight.\nHowever, when Duke Glendale saw Arix, his anger subsided, and a knowing smile appeared on his face. \"What if Arix wants to come with me willingly?\"\n\"That’s impossible. Arix wouldn’t listen to you,\" Scion said, his eyes showing rare mockery.\n\"Don’t be so sure,\" Duke Glendale said with a confident smile. Then he pretended to shout loudly, \"Prince Cassian is in danger!\"\nArix, who had been walking leisurely, immediately changed her expression. She flapped her little wings anxiously and flew over.\n\"Who did you say is in danger?!\" Arix’s psychic power started to stir from her anxiety, and a terrifying mental pressure filled the corridor.\nDuke Glendale’s eyes widened in fear, his legs trembling. This overwhelming power, he was familiar with it and he knew it was Supergiant+. He had heard rumors of someone in the Alliance possessing this power, but he never imagined it was Arix.\nHe thought Cassian was foolish but now it turned out he himself was the stupid one. If a bit of trick could win them the Alliance’s top genius, it was a major victory.\nDuke Glendale thought about Cassian, who was in a coma now, and then he came up with an idea.\nNoticing Arix’s worried expression, Duke Glendale couldn’t afford to delay. He feigned uncertainty and asked, \"Are you Miss Arix Kering?\"\n\"Yes, I am. What happened to Cassian? What’s going on?\" Arix asked, her voice tense.\nShe had seen Cassian before falling into the black hole and thought it was just a hallucination. But later, when she couldn’t contact him, she began to feel uneasy.\nShe knew Cassian must be in trouble; otherwise, he wouldn’t be unreachable.\nSeeing Arix’s concern, Duke Glendale decided to continue with his act. Sighing dramatically, he said, \"Prince Cassian has been injured from falling into the wormhole, and he hasn’t fully healed. And twice, my lady, twice did he force himself to use psychic power for your sake, Miss Arix...\"\n\"...Especially after witnessing you fall into the wormhole, His Highness fought fiercely with those two insectoids for your revenge. His leg was broken, his arm was fractured, and his psychic world is on the verge of collapse. Ah, my poor Prince Cassian! His life is truly full of hardships!\" Duke Glendale said emotionally, even pulling out a small handkerchief to dab at imaginary tears in the corners of his eyes.\nThe more Arix listened, the guiltier she felt. Her ears drooped, her heart heavy. She had no idea that Cassian had suffered so much because of her.\n’Quispe! Hardy! I swear, I will get back at you and avenge Cassian!’\nA cold glint flashed in Arix’s eyes as she silently vowed revenge in her heart.",

      "content": "Chapter 110: Protecting The Princess\nDuke Glendale could sense the moment was ripe to get a bit more sympathy for Cassian from Arix. But before he could speak, he caught sight of Scion’s fierce glare.\nDuke Glendale shut his mouth in fear.\n’Misjudged.’\nHe’d forgotten the overprotective one was still here.\nHe might be able to fool Arix, but the second Scion caught wind of it, his plan would crumble.\nIn the Empire, severe injuries or even missing limbs were common. Cassian wasn’t even missing any limbs.\nDuke Glendale shrank back, not daring to utter another word.\nBut Arix was oblivious to all this. Her anxiety was evident as tears formed in her eyes.\n\"You came to find me? Is it because I can save Cassian?\" Arix asked, staring intently at Duke Glendale.\n\"Yes, exactly. Prince Cassian has Supergiant+ psychic powers, so regular healing potions won’t work. Admiral Thaddeus suggested finding you, so here I am.\" Duke Glendale dropped Admiral Thaddeus’ name to show he had her father’s approval, hoping to avoid any moral pressure on the young one.\nHe sneaked a glance at Scion’s face. Seeing him more displeased than before, he quickly looked away.\n\"Then what are we waiting for? Let’s go!\" Arix, filled with worry for Cassian, had forgotten about Scion in her haste.\n\"Arix,\" Scion finally spoke up.\nArix paused, then hurried over to Scion. She handed him all the potions she had just prepared.\n\"Scion, these are for Vice Admiral De’an and the others. Please give the potions to them. Also, I need to leave for a bit. If Sunak comes back, tell him I’m at the Imperial Nexus, at the palace.\" She explained before turning to leave.\nBut as soon as she turned, Scion grabbed the back of her neck.\nArix was shocked and puzzled.\n\"Scion? What is it?\" Arix turned back and asked.\n\"Does Cassian really matter that much to you?\" Scion asked, eyes lowered to hide his expression.\nArix nodded firmly, \"Cassian is my best friend. He’s hurt, and I’m very worried. So, I must go. Also, if you were the one that’s gotten hurt, I’d do the same for you.\"\nHearing her words, Scion’s eyelashes trembled. He quickly let go of her neck, as if burned, and turned away to hide his reaction. He coughed, \"Alright, I understand. But I’ll go with you.\"\nArix was momentarily surprised but then nodded, thinking Scion didn’t want her to go alone. She didn’t think much more about it.\nWhile Arix didn’t think much of it, Duke Glendale, well-versed in matters of the heart, noticed Scion’s reddening ears.\nDuke Glendale’s pupils suddenly shrank. He swallowed hard, realizing he might have stumbled upon a shocking secret.\n’Could it be that Admiral Scion was falling for Arix?\n—\nNo way!’\nHe had to inform Cassian. He couldn’t let his poor prince suffer both physically and emotionally. It was his duty to safeguard the Empire’s future princess.\nDuke Glendale’s eyes lit up with a newfound sense of justice. At that moment, he felt like the beacon of righteousness shining on the mothership. He vowed to defeat the evil admiral and protect the weak, innocent princess for his ailing prince.\n\"What are you standing there for? Aren’t you rushing to save Prince Cassian?\" Scion was already holding the young one, ready to leave.\nAfter taking a few steps, he noticed that Duke Glendale was still standing there, lost in his thoughts.\nScion’s icy voice jolted Duke Glendale back to reality. Instinctively, he responded with a sycophantic smile, \"I’m setting off right away...\"\nHe hurriedly followed Scion, feeling a pang of guilt for lying. But he had no choice, as he was a weak old man, while Scion was the Empire’s admiral, capable of taking down an insectoid with a single blow.\nTwo hours later...\nThe three arrived at the gates of the Imperial Nexus after making about nine jumps through the warp machine.\nAs soon as they disembarked, Arix and Duke Glendale were a mess, though Scion looked merely a bit unwell.\nArix immediately vomited, even expelling bile from her stomach. After throwing up, she felt slight relief but still shuddered at the memory of the warp machine ride. It felt like being tossed around inside a washing machine for two hours.\nIf it weren’t for her decent psychic power, she would have been in the same dire state as Duke Glendale, who seemed to have nearly thrown up his heart and lungs. Arix glanced at him and silently muttered an amen.\nOrdinary people could only handle three jumps at most in a warp machine. Even Arix could only manage eight, but her concern for Cassian pushed her to endure nine.\nDuke Glendale, accustomed to frequent travels, managed to stretch his limit to nine jumps too.\nAfter resting for a bit, Duke Glendale managed to summon the energy to contact his butler, instructing him to come to the gate to pick them up.\nTen minutes later, Butler Dawson personally arrived in a luxurious carriage, stopping right in front of them.\n\"Your Grace, Lady Arix Kering, and Admiral Scion, please board the carriage.\" Butler Kasem respectfully greeted Arix and Scion as he descended from the carriage. He placed his right hand on his chest as he bowed first to Duke Glendale.\n\"Thank you,\" Arix said in her small, soft voice, waving a tiny paw from Scion’s arms.\n\"It’s my honor, my lady,\" Butler Kasem replied, his face full of respect and kindness as he looked at her.\nScion, with a cold expression, nodded at Kasem before carrying the little Arix into the carriage.\nDuke Glendale quickly followed and instructed, \"Straight to the palace.\"\n\"Yes, Your Grace,\" Butler Kasem responded respectfully. He then cracked the whip in the air, urging the horses toward the palace.\nImperial Nexus had a unique look, almost like something from a different world, yet it also felt like ancient Greece.\nLining the streets, you’d find plenty of potion stores, mecha shops, Psychic Ware stores, and material shops.\nThe real eye-catchers were the fancy restaurants. At the doors of these restaurants, you’d see cat-eared maids and wolf-eared butlers inviting people inside.\nArix felt a strong pull to enter, not for the food, but because those maids and butlers looked more appealing than any dish.\n’The people of the Empire sure know how to live it up!’\nArix silently gave them a thumbs-up in his mind.\nTheir carriage moved quickly, reaching the palace gates in under half an hour.\nSince carriages weren’t allowed past the gates, Arix and his companions had to get out. After a quick security check, they were let inside the palace grounds.\nAs they walked along the palace path, Arix nestled in Scion’s arms, taking in Cassian’s residence.\nIt was clear this place was made for royalty—grand and luxurious. Every building and feature screamed extravagance but didn’t feel too much.\nThe gardens were perfectly designed with fountains, pools, sculptures, and nurseries blending seamlessly with the palace.\nThey walked for what felt like forever before stopping. Arix then realized they had arrived at Cassian’s chambers.\nAndor, the royal chamberlain, was waiting outside. He hurried over, bowing respectfully with his hand over his chest, \"Your Grace, Admiral Scion, and... this must be Lady Arix Kering.\"\nDuke Glendale and Scion gave short nods in return, while Arix responded enthusiastically, \"Yes, I’m Arix. Do you know me?\"\n\"His Highness mentioned a lot about you, my lady,\" Andor replied with a knowing smile.\nArix was about to say more, but Scion, looking a bit annoyed, carried her inside without another word.\nArix rolled her eyes and stopped.\n’So, no talking for the little one? Can’t even chat a bit?’\nArix saw Scion’s expression and decided to keep her thoughts to herself.\nInside Cassian’s chambers, besides Cassian lying unconscious on the bed, there were only two other people in the room—a handsome man in luxurious clothes, the ruler of the Empire, Alpha Leonidas, and a beautiful woman beside him, Cassian’s mother, Alpha Leonidas’ mate, and the Empire’s sole Luna, Amethyst.\n\"Greetings, Your Majesty,\" Duke Glendale and Scion placed their hands over their chests and bowed respectfully.\nArix joined in with a cute howl.",

      "content": "Chapter 111: Helping Cassian\nAlpha Leonidas gave Arix a brief glance and a slight nod.\nLuna Amethyst had her eyes on Arix the moment she walked in.\n\"Arix, right? Cassian talks about you often. This is our first meeting, and I’m Cassian’s mother. It’s a pleasure to meet you.\" Unlike the aloof Alpha Leonidas, Luna Amethyst radiated warmth and cheer. Her gaze was soft as she looked at Arix.\nThough worried about Cassian, Arix managed to keep her anxiety in check. She bowed her little head respectfully, \"Thank you, Your Majesty. I’m honored.\"\n\"You can call me Auntie Amy. And Arix, may I hug you?\" Luna Amethyst’s eyes sparkled as she looked at the adorable young cub before her. She was determined to bond well with her ’future daughter-in-law.’\nLuna Amethyst’s smile grew even kinder, and Arix found herself admiring Cassian’s beautiful mother. So, when Luna Amethyst asked for a hug, Arix shyly glanced at her and then nodded, feeling a bit embarrassed but willing.\nIn the next moment, Arix was enveloped in a soft, warm embrace. As she enjoyed the comfort, she couldn’t help but think that Cassian must have had a very cozy childhood.\nLuna Amethyst hugged and petted Arix for a while, clearly delighted. Once she had her fill, she reluctantly released Arix and said, \"Arix, I like you so much. Would you consider staying in the Empire? I can have Leonidas make you the only princess of the Empire.\"\nAlpha Leonidas, hearing his mate’s playful offer, finally looked over. Instead of reprimanding her, he gave Luna Amethyst a fond look and nodded at Arix, signaling his agreement.\n\"Thank you, Auntie Amy. But I have to return to the Hecaris Military Academy in the Alliance next month, so I can’t stay here for too long,\" Arix replied, touched by their kindness but politely declining their offer.\n\"That’s a pity, but make sure to visit me often,\" Luna Amethyst sighed with genuine regret but remained cheerful as she gently patted Arix’s head. She was confident that one day, Arix would be part of their family.\n\"Of course, I will. I like you too, Auntie Amy,\" Arix said sweetly.\n\"My little Arix, you’re such a little sweet girl,\" Luna Amethyst said, beaming with joy. She even planted a kiss on Arix’s forehead.\nSeeing the two getting a bit too affectionate, Duke Glendale, worried about his young prince, finally spoke up, \"How about we check on His Highness first?\"\nThe room fell silent. Luna Amethyst and Arix exchanged awkward glances, both coughing nervously before putting on serious expressions.\n\"Arix, could you help Auntie take a look? It seems my Cassian is unwell,\" Luna Amethyst said, trying to appear stern as she carried Arix to Cassian’s bedside.\n\"Alright, I’ll check now,\" Arix responded, her cute face turning serious as she let out a soft howl.\nDuke Glendale rolled his eyes secretly but refrained from pointing out their obvious awkwardness.\nBefore starting the treatment, Arix made sure to check Cassian’s body first. Then, using her psychic power, she carefully examined his condition.\nThe verdict? Cassian’s body was fine, but his psychic world was on the brink of collapse.\nSeeing Cassian’s psychic world riddled with cracks hit Arix hard. She remembered that time with the Hecaris wormhole. Back then, Cassian’s psychic world probably hadn’t healed either, but he still chose to help her, supporting the psychic barrier together, even though it worsened his own injuries.\nNow, he nearly shattered his psychic world seeking revenge.\n’Cassian, you’re not a fool, so why do something so reckless for me again? Is it worth it?’\nArix’s eyes stung with tears.\nWith a heart full of sorrow, she gently nuzzled Cassian. She then started transferring Vita’s psychic power into his crumbling psychic world.\n\"Vita, I really need your help this time,\" Arix’s voice, for once, held a plea.\n\"Okay,\" Vita’s gentle voice resonated in her psychic world.\nArix and Vita’s consciousness entered Cassian’s psychic world together.\nUnlike the psychic worlds of the Alliance people, where psychic power appeared as diamond crystals, therian psychic incarnation had consciousness represented by small, animal forms.\nTo Arix’s surprise, Cassian’s psychic incarnation was actually awake!\nYet, he showed no fear or concern for the collapsing psychic world around him. He lay sprawled on the ground like a pancake, muttering something.\nArix had seen her own psychic incarnation turn into an animal form, so she wasn’t surprised.\nShe was just a bit angry that, Cassian hadn’t even noticed someone had invaded his psychic world and was just lying there, doing nothing to heal it.\nPsychic worlds can self-heal, albeit slowly, but it’s better than doing nothing. Yet Cassian didn’t care at all, letting his psychic world continue to crumble.\nWhat hurt Arix the most was that she almost cried for this guy, while he was there not caring about his own injuries.\nVita seemed to sense something and said sympathetically, \"Arix, take it easy on him. He’s still a patient, after all.\"\nArix’s eyes turned cold, and with a wicked smile, she said, \"I’m his doctor now, aren’t I? Vita, you go heal his psychic world. I’ll give his brain some treatment.\"\n\"Alright,\" Vita replied, seeing that Arix couldn’t be persuaded. She could only look at Cassian with pity.\nThen, flapping her wings, she began mending the cracks in the psychic world.\nThe unusual activity finally caught Cassian’s attention. Just as he was about to look up, he saw a white furball charging at him.\nCassian’s eyes sharpened, and he leaped back to avoid the sudden attack. Just as he was about to counterattack, he realized his assailant was a tiger cub.\n\"Who are you?\" Cassian paused his attack, staring in confusion at the little furball before him.\n\"Hmph!\" Arix sneered, not surprised that Cassian didn’t recognize her.\nAfter all, few people knew she had turned into a therian. She had tried to tell Cassian before but couldn’t get in touch with him.\nShe’d worried about him for so long, and look at what she found out today— Cassian was slacking off! She swore to the Moon Goddess that she’s definitely give him a lesson today.\nThe more she thought about it, the angrier she became. Instead of answering his question, she bared her little fangs and lunged at him.\nCassian looked helplessly at the tiny cub attacking without warning and threatened. \"I’m in a bad mood right now. If you keep this up, I won’t go easy on you!\"\nArix sneered internally. She didn’t use psychic power but went at him with teeth and claws. Her fierce gaze and actions almost made Cassian think he had stolen the cub’s food or something. Otherwise, why would a bottle-sucking cub be chasing and biting him?\nHe ran, she chased.\n\"Enough, you little brat! I’m only going easy on you because you’re small, not because I’m afraid! If you keep causing trouble, I’ll fight back!\" Cassian was angry now, his light golden eyes flaring with anger.\nArix bared her teeth in disdain, ignoring Cassian’s threats, and lunged at him again.\nCassian sighed, seeing no other choice but to fight back.\nSo, the two little furballs wrestled, punching and kicking each other for quite a while.\nIt wasn’t until Vita finished mending the psychic world that the two cubs were still at it.\n\"Arix, the psychic world is repaired. Shall we leave now?\" Vita asked, a bit exasperated, seeing the two cubs still fighting.\nCassian’s movement froze just as he was about to counterattack. He couldn’t believe he just heard that name.\nTaking advantage of Cassian’s distraction, Arix bit his neck and started smacking his butt with her paw. Strangely, Cassian didn’t resist; instead, he shyly buried his face under his paws.\nArix looked puzzled.\n’Did I hit him so hard he got stupid?’\nCassian, on the other hand, was blushing much, screaming internally.\n’Arix actually bit my neck! Is she proposing to me?’\nIn the Empire, the rule was that if a male therian wanted to court a female therian, he could choose to fight her. If he won, he could bite her neck. So, biting a therian’s neck in the Empire signified both courtship and the intention to mate.\nBut Arix didn’t know any of this. After spanking Cassian, she felt much better.\nArix released Cassian’s neck. She gave him one last haughty snort before exiting the psychic world with Vita.\nStill in place, Cassian blushed furiously for a while before finally lifting his head. His golden eyes, shimmering with a watery glow, shyly looked in the direction Arix had left.\nCassian knew Arix probably didn’t understand the meaning behind biting someone’s neck, but he couldn’t help feeling a rush of joy and excitement.\nNow, it was his turn to leave. He had been hiding in his psychic world, afraid the outside world no longer had Arix in it. But now that Arix was alive and had shown such a gesture, there was no way he could let her off the hook.\nAfter all, he was an innocent, pure-hearted wolf. She had ruined his purity, and she had to take responsibility for that!",

      "content": "Chapter 112: A Jealousy Alpha\nArix’s mind snapped back to reality.\nAs soon as she remembered the mess from the psychic world, she smacked Cassian on the head with her paw. But the second she did, she realized Cassian’s parents were right there.\nHer paw froze. She quickly switched to a gentle pat, rubbing his head softly instead. Everyone around noticed but acted like they didn’t see a thing.\nLuna Amethyst turned and chuckled. She then coughed to cover it up and, with a kind smile, picked up Arix. \"Arix, is the healing done?\" she asked, gently stroking Arix’s back.\nSeeing that no one called her out, Arix sighed with relief. She nuzzled against Luna Amethyst and said in a cutesy voice, \"Don’t worry, Cassian is fine now.\"\n\"Good, on behalf of Cassian, thank you, Arix.\" Luna Amethyst’s voice was sweet and soothing, her eyes as gentle and captivating as a spring lake.\nArix got lost in her beauty, even drooling a bit. She thought,\n’Such a beautiful Luna...’\nMeanwhile, Alpha Leonidas watched with a hint of jealousy, because her wife was seldom so kind and gentle to him.\nWith a stern face, he said, \"Amethyst, they’ve had a long journey. They should go back and rest, especially the little cub who needs plenty of sleep.\"\nSnuggled in Luna Amethyst’s soft, fragrant embrace, Arix felt so peaceful.\n’Gosh, Alpha Leonidas, you’re a grown man, how can you be jealous of a little cub? Can’t she hold me a bit longer?’\nThough frustrated, Arix didn’t dare confront Alpha Leonidas. She just burrowed deeper into Luna Amethyst’s arms, pretending not to hear him.\nLuna Amethyst, sensing his jealousy, gave Alpha Leonidas a knowing and slightly annoyed look. Only when he sheepishly turned away did she snort.\n\"Arix, ignore this old man. Would you stay with Auntie for a few more days?\" Luna Amethyst’s face softened into a doting smile as she looked at Arix.\nArix was about to agree when Scion’s voice cut in.\n\"Sorry, Luna Amethyst. Everyone back at the clan is waiting for Arix. If she’s done here, I’ll take her back now,\" Scion said, cold yet polite.\n\"Fine,\" Alpha Leonidas quickly agreed.\nLuna Amethyst rolled her eyes, speechless. She had seen dads sabotage their sons, but never like this. A rare chance for her son to bond, wasted by his own father.\nSince Alpha Leonidas had spoken, Luna Amethyst couldn’t argue. She sighed inwardly, thinking,\n’Son, you’ll have to woo your bride yourself. Your mother did her best.’\nWith a helpless sigh, Luna Amethyst handed Arix over to Scion. She gently patted Arix’s head and said, \"Arix, come visit me often, okay?\"\n\"Okay,\" Arix nodded obediently, rubbing her head against Luna Amethyst’s palm for comfort.\nLuna Amethyst’s heart melted at Arix’s cuteness.\nScion was patiently waiting aside. After the two said goodbyes, he finally took Arix in his arms and left the palace with Duke Glendale.\nShortly after they left, Cassian woke up. The first thing he did was look around anxiously, but there was no sign of Arix.\nThinking it had all been a dream, he let out a depressed howl and slumped back, looking completely defeated.\nLuna Amethyst covered her eyes, embarrassed by her son’s cluelessness. \"Arix has already left. If you go now, you might catch up with her,\" she said. She pretended to be annoyed but, she was unable to hide her concern.\nAs soon as she said that, the previously listless Cassian sprang to life and disappeared in a flash.\nWatching the empty bed, Luna Amethyst shook her head and turned to Alpha Leonidas with a look of disdain. \"Look at what you’ve done to our son. He’s so foolish that I almost don’t want to admit he’s mine.\"\nAlpha Leonidas didn’t dare argue; he just smiled and kept quiet.\nSeeing that Amethyst was still upset, he changed the subject. \"Amethyst, do you want that little cub to be Cassian’s mate?\"\n\"Yeah, got a problem with that?\" Luna Amethyst looked questioningly at Alpha Leonidas.\n\"But she’s from the Alliance,\" Alpha Leonidas pointed out the crux of the matter.\nThe Alliance and the Empire, while not mortal enemies, had been at odds for a long time. Even if they agreed, the other ministers in the Empire would likely oppose it.\nAfter all, Luna was supposed to the role model of all females of the nation. Allowing an outsider to take such a position would surely cause an uproar within the Empire.\nHearing this, Luna Amethyst’s eyes, usually soft like spring, instantly turned cold. Her voice icy, she said, \"I don’t care if she’s from the Empire or the Alliance. As long as my son likes her, she can even be a non-human. If anyone objects, I’ll beat them into submission.\"\nAlpha Leonidas didn’t argue. Instead, he gently put his arm around his wife’s shoulder and said affectionately, \"Amethyst, you’re as intimidating as ever.\"\n\"If I weren’t, how could I have become your wife so smoothly?\" Luna Amethyst poked Alpha Leonidas’s chest with her finger, her tone teasing.\nLuna Amethyst’s background wasn’t great. When she was young and fell in love with Alpha Leonidas, many ministers opposed their relationship.\nFortunately, she had excellent abilities. Whenever a minister objected, Luna Amethyst would find their sons or daughters, who were also her classmates. She’d spar with them daily, always giving them a thorough beating.\nThis not only vented her frustrations but also kept her actions within the bounds of sparring, avoiding any serious repercussions.\nAs for retaliation, no therian in the Empire dared to touch Leonidas’s woman.\nGetting beaten up by Luna Amethyst might result in some injuries, but if Alpha Leonidas got involved, several lives wouldn’t be enough to cover the cost.\nIn the end, Luna Amethyst got what she wanted, but the ministers of the Empire were left pulling their hair out.\nEach time they returned home, they were greeted by their battered and bruised sons and daughters, who would desperately beg them to stop picking fights they couldn’t win.\nAs a result, no one dared to oppose Amethyst becoming Luna. The ministers had learned their lesson well.\nThinking back on those days, Leonidas’s lips curled into a smile, and his eyes were filled with even deeper affection for his wife.\nWith her small hand constantly poking at his chest, Leonidas felt his breath quicken.\nHe swallowed hard, then swiftly scooped Luna Amethyst into his arms, disappearing from the room in a flash.",

      "content": "Chapter 113: The Tiger Clan\nIn the carriage on their way back, it was just Arix and Scion. Duke Glendale had gone off to attend to other business right after they left the palace.\nMaybe it was because she was going to meet family, but even though the carriage wasn’t speeding, Arix felt like the trip was over in no time.\nThe thought of meeting all those family made Arix a bit nervous. The fear from her last encounter with them still lingered, and now she had to face it again.\nPlus, she wasn’t sure if her tiger clan relatives would accept her, considering she wasn’t from the Empire.\nWith a mix of nerves and anticipation, they finally arrived at the gate of a grand estate.\n\"Arix, are you scared?\" Scion asked. He noticed the little cub hiding in his arm was peeking out with just her eyes. He remembered how this little cub had been so brave on the battlefield surrounded by insectoids.\nNow, heading home, she seemed to have lost her nerve.\nIf he didn’t know better, Scion might have thought the cub in his arms had been swapped.\n\"I’m not scared, what’s there to be scared of...\" Arix gulped, trying to sound brave.\n\"Arix, your legs are shaking. Not very convincing,\" Scion said plainly, looking at the trembling cub in his arms.\nArix smiled awkwardly.\nSeeing that she couldn’t find the words to argue, Scion gently rubbed her head in a rare show of affection. \"Don’t be afraid. I’m here.\"\nArix looked up unintentionally and saw Scion’s rare smile. His handsome face with that smile felt like a gentle autumn breeze over a calm lake. It wasn’t overpowering, but it reached deep into her heart.\nTHUMP HUMP THUMP...\nHer tired heart sprang to life and started jumping wildly. But just as quickly as it revived, it died again when Arix remembered that the person in front of her was destined to become the Empire’s future Pontifex.\nIt was like a bucket of ice water had been dumped on her, extinguishing any budding feelings she had. Arix reminded herself that if she didn’t want to end up like her grandparents, she couldn’t entertain such thoughts.\nWith a sigh, she weakly replied to Scion, \"Okay,\" and slumped in his arms, feeling downcast.\nHowever, Scion’s comfort had worked. This tough love meant she wasn’t as scared of meeting her relatives anymore.\nAfter all, what could be more heartbreaking than seeing your dream guy destined to become a cold and nonsexual priest?\nWhen the two entered the estate, Arix saw the tiger clan already waiting in the living room.\nThe members of the tiger clan were all strikingly good-looking. With their signature silver hair and blue eyes, they had an innate air of cool nobility. Even if they were to wander the streets, no one would ever mistake them for ordinary people.\nThe leader of the tiger clan was a robust middle-aged man, and the highest-ranking members were the five elders standing beside him. Then there were the dozen or so aunts and uncles, followed by numerous cousins whom Arix didn’t recognize.\nWhen Scion appeared, everyone except the clan leader and the elders placed their right hands on their chests. They respectfully greeted him with an Empire salute. \"Admiral Scion!\"\nAt this moment, Scion set aside his usual aloof demeanor and returned the greeting politely.\nAfter exchanging pleasantries, the oldest elder looked kindly at Arix and then asked Scion, \"Is this Vezgor’s granddaughter?\"\n\"Yes, this is Arix. Arix, these five elders are your grandfather’s brothers. They have six brothers in total. And this is our patriarch, your uncle,\" Scion patiently introduced each one.\nScion’s gentle and patient manner surprised the clan leader and the five elders. They exchanged astonished looks, thinking the same thing: it seemed Scion liked the little cub a lot.\nAfter the introductions, Arix, with a nervous yet sweet tone, greeted everyone one by one. Her adorable demeanor quickly won over the elders’ hearts. They eagerly filled Arix’s Space Button with useful and interesting trinkets from their personal collections.\n\"Arix, dear, you’re so cute. You should visit me often,\" one enthusiastic woman said. She was one of Arix’s aunts. She rubbed Arix’s hair and gave her a kiss on the cheek.\n\"Do remember to come to my house. The grapes in our garden are ripe and incredibly sweet,\" another man said, patting Arix’s head. According to Scion, he was one of Arix’s uncles.\n\"Arix, this is my lollipop. Want to have a try?\" said a young girl. She was one of Arix’s cousins and she was just three years old. She was now in her beast form, offering Arix a lollipop covered in saliva.\nSeeing the drool-covered lollipop, Arix’s eye twitched, and she politely declined with a forced smile.\nThis family reunion lasted about half an hour, during which Arix got to know everyone.\nFinally, the eldest elder called over his grandson and sternly instructed, \"Targon, show your cousin around.\"\n\"Yes, Grandpa,\" Targon replied. He was a young man of about fifteen, with the silver hair and blue eyes typical of the tiger clan, and he exuded a sunny disposition.\nScion had some discussions to handle with the elders, so he gently placed Arix into Targon’s arms. Rubbing her head, he said, \"Go hang out with your cousin, Targon. I’ll come find you when I’m done.\"\nArix, understanding that the adults had things to talk about, obediently nodded and responded, \"Okay, Scion.\"\nWith a slight smile, Scion nodded gently before heading off with the elders towards the meeting room.\nTargon, now tasked with looking after Arix, looked at her with some surprise. \"You and Scion are pretty close now, huh? That’s kind of a big deal in this clan, you know. He’s always so cold to us, and this is the first time I’ve seen him smile.\"\n\"Well, what can I say? I’m just adorable,\" Arix replied, lifting her small chin proudly.\nTargon chuckled, finding her amusing. He ruffled her fluffy head and said, \"Alright, you’re the cutest. So, where does my adorable little cousin want to go today?\"\nArix blinked, recalling all the gifts she received earlier. An idea quickly formed in her mind. She looked up at Targon and said, \"To the materials shop.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 114: Poor Targon\nIn the bustling streets of Imperial Nexus, Targon and Arix were browsing a store filled with raw materials.\nThey wandered through the aisles, listening to the salesman’s enthusiastic introduction to the medical ingredients on display.\nTargon, though not interested in the slightest, showed no sign of impatience. He followed Arix, moving from one display case to another, gently accompanying her.\nArix carefully examined the medical ingredients and seemed quite pleased. She nodded with satisfaction and turned to the helpful salesman. \"I’d like to buy these medical ingredients. Can you get them ready for me?\"\n\"Of course, esteemed customer. What do you need?\" the salesman replied with a polite smile.\nArix began listing her items, \"One kilogram of Uncaria, five kilograms of Gynostemma, one kilogram of Eclipta, three kilograms of Polygonum, and two kilograms of Borax...\"\nThe salesman diligently noted each item on his opticomputer and quickly calculated the total. He then informed Arix respectfully, \"My lady, your total is 350,000 credits. Will you be paying via cash or card?\"\nArix didn’t bat an eye at the price. She turned to Targon and asked, \"Cousin Targon, will you pay by transfer or card?\"\nTargon looked stunned. \"Aren’t you the one buying these?\" he asked, bewildered.\n\"Yes, but I don’t have any credits,\" Arix replied, her tone innocent yet firm.\nTargon was at a loss for words. This little cub was more like a little devil.\nHalf an hour later, they left the store, Targon looking like a wilted flower as he patted his now-empty wallet. He had just spent a small fortune, wiping out several months’ worth of budget to please his cousin.\nArix, feeling accomplished, patted her Space Button and then gave Targon’s arm a comforting pat. \"Don’t feel bad. I’ll give you a surprise when we get back, and you’ll think it was worth it.\"\n\"Hum?\" Targon muttered, too exhausted to argue. Trusting a kid’s promise seemed crazy.\nBut as he looked at his cousin, he thought maybe it was worth it. Money could be earned back, but time with Arix was rare.\nCuriosity got the better of him. \"Arix, why did you buy so many medical ingredients?\" he asked, glancing at her.\n\"To make potions, of course,\" Arix answered matter-of-factly.\n\"Really? You can make potions?\" Targon asked, surprised.\n\"Yes, it’s not hard at all,\" Arix said, as if it were the simplest thing in the world. For her, making potions was as easy as eating and drinking.\nTargon remained skeptical, thinking his little cousin might just be a bit too confident.\nNot wanting to crush her enthusiasm, Targon switched the subject. \"So, where do you want to go next?\"\n\"Let’s wander a bit more before heading back,\" Arix said. It was a rare chance to visit the Empire, and she didn’t want to waste it.\n\"Alright, but just so you know, we’re only looking. I’m out of money,\" Targon warned, giving her a heads-up.\n\"I already bought everything I needed, but huh... you’re poorer than I expected,\" Arix remarked, her tone almost sympathetic.\nEven the least wealthy person in her household, Drexel, probably had millions of astrocredits from their interstellarnet store dividends.\nTargon felt a surge of frustration. Spending his money and then calling him poor—this little rascal was something else!\nHe ruffled Arix’s hair vigorously, feeling slightly better afterward.\nArix didn’t resist, sensing her cousin’s need to vent. Letting him have this small victory, she allowed her hair to get mussed.\nAs evening approached, they began heading back home. Just as they reached the front door, Targon suddenly stopped in his tracks. \"Prince Cassian, what are you doing here?\" he asked, surprised.\nHearing the name Cassian, Arix finally looked up at the entrance. There stood a striking young man with snow-white hair and golden eyes, looking like the sun god Apollo himself.\n’Wow, so handsome!’\nArix’s eyes sparkled, but she quickly shook her head to snap out of it. No, she was still mad at him.\nShe turned her head away, deliberately ignoring Cassian.\nCassian hadn’t anticipated his well-thought-out charm offensive to fail so quickly. He had spent considerable time preparing to see Arix.\nThinking back on why Arix might be upset, Cassian concluded it was probably because he hadn’t been taking care of his health. That had to be why she was so mad.\nWith softened eyes, Cassian walked up to Targon and asked gently, \"May I hold Arix?\"\n\"Uh... okay,\" Targon hesitated for a moment but then handed Arix over without much fuss.\nCassian was the strongest of their generation in the Empire, and Targon idolized him. Everyone admired Cassian, so Targon assumed his cousin would be happy too.\nArix, now feeling trapped, remained silent.\n’Seriously? He just handed me over like this? Doesn’t he see I’m still mad?’\nArix grumbled inwardly but maintained a cold expression to preserve her dignity.\n\"Arix,\" Cassian said softly, holding her gently.\nArix, resting her head on his shoulder, closed her eyes with a haughty air. When Cassian called her name, she just twitched her ears and turned her head away, still ignoring him.\n\"I’ve missed you so much,\" Cassian said, his voice filled with restrained longing.\nThose simple words made Arix’s cheeks flush bright red. She lifted her paw and protested by tapping his arm.\n\"If you really missed me, why did you stay hidden in the psychic world and not come out? Do you know how worried I was?\" Arix, perched on Cassian’s arm, complained non-stop.\n\"I was wrong. I won’t do that again,\" Cassian admitted immediately. No matter what happened, in his eyes, Arix was always right.\n\"Hmph,\" Arix snorted, clearly pleased.\nSeeing Arix’s anger melt away, Cassian seemed to relax completely. He held her close, his voice filled with deep relief. \"Arix, I’m so glad you’re safe. I could’ve been lost in that world forever.\"\nFeeling Cassian’s genuine concern, Arix’s lips curved into a soft smile. She gently reassured him, \"Are you silly? I’d always try everything to get you out.\"\n\"Yeah, I know you will,\" Cassian agreed, not arguing. He felt like a wandering soul who had finally found its home.",

      "content": "Chapter 115: Cassian Meeting Scion\nTargon lingered nearby, observing the scene unfold for what felt like forever.\nHe wanted to say something but hesitated. He felt overwhelmed, like he’d eaten a huge ostrich egg, or worse, been force-fed one. The guilt gnawed at him,\n’Did I really just give Arix to someone else?’\nAs he pondered whether to try and fix things, a sudden chill ran down his spine. Targon froze and slowly turned around, dreading what he might see. There, standing in the doorway, was Scion.\nNo one knew for how long he had been standing there.\nScion’s eyes were locked on the two embracing. He didn’t move or speak, but Targon could feel the coldness radiating from him. Trembling, Targon managed to whisper, \"Cousin Scion...\"\nBut Scion paid no attention to Targon. His gaze stayed on Arix and Cassian. \"Arix, it’s getting dark. Time to go back,\" Scion said, though his eyes were fixed on Cassian.\nArix lit up at the sound of his voice. \"Scion! Are you done with your work?\" she asked, excitement evident in her tone.\n\"Yes, it’s time for dinner. Let’s head home,\" Scion replied, his voice warm as he looked at Arix. Then he turned to Cassian, his tone turning cold and businesslike. \"Your Highness, you should return early too. It’s not safe out here.\"\nCassian’s arms tightened around Arix for a moment before he let go, handing the little cub to Scion. He reached out to ruffle Arix’s hair but stopped when Scion’s hand intervened.\n\"Your Highness, Arix is a girl. It’s better to keep some distance,\" Scion said, his face unreadable.\nCassian’s eyes darkened briefly, but he pulled his hand back. He gave Arix a gentle smile. \"Arix, I’ll come to see you again tomorrow.\"\n\"Okay!\" Arix chirped, waving her little paw from Scion’s arms.\nThe moment Scion had Arix, his polite demeanor towards Cassian disappeared, replaced by a frosty look. Without another word, he turned and walked out the door with Arix.\nArix wanted to say a proper goodbye to Cassian but found herself cut off by Scion once again. Used to this, she simply pouted a bit, not complaining.\nTargon watched as Scion and Arix left without even acknowledging him. He then glanced at Cassian, who remained standing there. Targon felt invisible, like a ghost in a scene meant for four people.\n\"Does Scion really care for Arix that much?\" Cassian asked, staring after the pair with a strange expression.\nTargon looked around to make sure no one else was nearby before finally confirming that Cassian was indeed talking to him.\nFeeling moved that someone had remembered him, he poured his heart out. \"Yeah, he really cares about Arix. You know, I stay by his side a lot, and I’ve never seen him smile. But today, I saw him smile at Arix several times. He even came to pick her up just now. Normally, he wouldn’t care if we didn’t come home.\"\nHe wanted to continue, but Cassian interrupted, \"Enough, you don’t need to say more.\"\nCassian’s lips held a smile, but the chill emanating from him was no less than Scion’s earlier.\nTargon shivered, feeling as if winter had come, making him freeze multiple times today. He resolved to have a bowl of ginger soup when he got home to warm up.\n\"Um, if you don’t need anything else, Your Highness, I’ll head back now,\" Targon said, wrapping his clothes tighter around himself, feeling that he might catch a cold if he stayed any longer.\n\"Yes, thank you for today,\" Cassian replied with a forced smile before turning to leave. As he turned, the smile vanished from Cassian’s face.\n’Scion, huh?’\nCassian recalled Duke Glendale’s words earlier today.\nAt first, he didn’t believe it. After all, anyone could have designs on Arix, except for Scion, who was never on his radar. But witnessing Scion’s actions just now forced him to accept the reality: Scion might indeed have feelings for Arix. Perhaps even Scion himself hadn’t realized this yet.\nWatching Scion, who was no less capable than himself, Cassian felt a deep sense of jealousy. But thinking about Scion’s future as the Pontifex, Cassian’s lips curled into a strange smile. A man destined to devote his life to the Moon Goddess—if he lost to such a rival, he might as well step outside and let an insectoid finish him off now.\nMeanwhile, Targon, seeing the now-empty doorway, felt an overwhelming sense of loneliness. He closed the door and hurried to catch up with Scion and the others.\n\"What’s holding you back there, Targon?\" Arix said. She perched in Scion’s arms, looking at Targon with some disdain as he finally caught up.\n\"You have Scion to carry you; I don’t,\" Targon replied, his tone dripping with jealousy.\n\"What are you talking about? Sorry, can’t hear ya,\" Arix teased, sticking out her tongue at Targon before deliberately snuggling closer to Scion.\nFinally, she flashed a mischievous smile at Targon, showing her teeth in a way that invited a playful scolding.\nThe flames of frustration in Targon’s heart flared up instantly, reaching towering heights. He wanted nothing more than to grab the little cub and give her a good spanking.\nHowever, just one more look at Scion’s impassive face doused Targon’s fury as quickly as if he’d been hit with a fire extinguisher.\nWith a deadpan face, Targon silently mouthed to Arix, \"Just you wait!\"\n\"Hahaha!\" Arix laughed uncontrollably at Targon’s frustrated expression, knowing his desire to smack her was tempered by his fear of Scion. She laughed so hard that she almost exposed her belly.\nScion glanced down, noticing the little cub’s exposed belly. He gently covered it with his sleeve. \"Arix, stop messing around. And never expose your belly to an ’enemy’ like this,\" he said softly.\n\"Okay, Scion,\" Arix replied obediently, settling back down.\nScion patted her head gently and continued walking towards the main hall. The family gathered there for their weekly dinner, and today happened to be the day.\nThe hall was already filled with many members of the family. They all seated around a long, wide wooden table, chatting as they waited for the food to be served.\nScion found his seat and sat down with Arix in his arms. \"Arix, did you have fun today?\" asked one of her grandfather’s brothers. The old man was sitting at the head of the table, looking kindly at her.\n\"Yes, I had a lot of fun. Targon took me to play, and there were so many fun things to do,\" Arix responded sweetly.\n\"That’s good. Arix, you should consider this your home. Don’t feel shy or reserved,\" the old man said with a warm smile.\n\"Okay, thank you,\" Arix nodded her little head adorably.\nSitting aside, Targon felt a pang of sadness and grabbed a drumstick for himself. He thought to himself,\n’Clearly, I’m the most miserable one today. Why didn’t Grandpa care about me too?’\nBut he had come to realize that Arix must have some sort of magical charm. With her around, even his dearest Grandpa treated him as if he were invisible.",

      "content": "Chapter 116: Misguided Path\nAfter everyone enjoyed their lively meal, the maids swiftly cleared the table, replacing the leftovers with fresh plates of fruits and milk.\nArix assumed they’d leave after eating, but when no one moved, she stayed put, curious.\nKrylak, the tiger clan patriarch seated at the head of the table, spoke up with a serious tone. \"Now that we’re all here today, I’d like to make an announcement. The annual family bloodline test will be held three days later, at noon time. Please bring all your untested clan members from each territory to participate.\"\nEveryone except Arix seemed to expect this and nodded calmly.\nWhile Arix wondered how the bloodline test would be conducted, Krylak continued. His voice now carried a chilling edge that sent a shiver down Arix’s spine.\n\"There’s something else you might not know yet,\" Krylak said, his tone mixing anger and complexity. \"My nephew, Scion, the pride of our tiger clan, nearly died on the battlefield due to someone’s vile intervention.\"\nKrylak’s words struck like lightning, shocking everyone into a flurry of whispers.\n\"My god, someone tried to harm Scion? Are they trying to make an eternal enemy of our clan?\"\n\"And Scion is the future Pontifex! Who would be so foolish to target him, risking the wrath of the Moon Goddess Temple?\"\n\"Exactly! Do they even realize how crucial the Pontifex is to the Empire? He’s vital for our cubs’ transformation into their beast forms. The audacity, it’s unimaginable, lawless!\"\nThe hall buzzed with disbelief. No one could fathom someone daring to target the future Pontifex.\nIf this news spread, it would incite the entire Empire of Sacred Moonlight to fury.\nArix could understand; it was like trying to harm a revered veteran in the old world; the whole nation would erupt in rage.\nSome of the more protective tiger clan members were furious, banging the table and demanding to know which clan dared plot against their pride.\n\"Krylak, tell us who dared to harm Scion. We’ll grab our weapons and take them out now,\" one hot-tempered member demanded angrily, barely restraining himself from flipping the table out of respect for their family.\nKrylak had anticipated the clan’s fury, but the real tragedy lay in the fact that the mastermind wasn’t an external enemy, but a traitor within their own ranks.\nKrylak’s eyes grew dim for a moment before he turned his gaze towards the fifth elder, who had been sitting silently in his chair.\n\"Uncle Velkor, you tell them,\" Krylak said, then closed his eyes wearily.\nAt these words, the entire hall fell silent, as if someone had collectively gripped their throats. Everyone turned their incredulous eyes towards their revered Velkor.\n\"Impossible! It can’t be my grandfather. He’s dedicated his whole life to the clan. How could he possibly harm Cousin Scion?\" Velkor’s grandson, Torvak, stood up in a frenzy, furiously denying the accusation.\nHe couldn’t believe it. He knew better than anyone how much his grandfather had sacrificed for the clan. There were countless times when Velkor had risked his life but said that his injuries were worth it, that they were honorable.\nSuch a man, who had devoted his entire life to the family, would never be the one to plot against Scion. Even in death, Torvak wouldn’t believe it was true.\n\"Sit down, Torvak. What Krylak said is true,\" Velkor, in contrast to his agitated grandson, accepted the situation calmly.\nWhen he had made his move against Scion, he had already prepared himself for the consequences, even if it meant dying alongside Scion.\nThe only thing he couldn’t let go of was his innocent and naive grandson, which was why he had endured the pain of betraying the clan and clung to life.\n\"No! No! This isn’t true! It can’t be true!\" Torvak felt as if the very essence of his existence had been ripped away upon hearing his grandfather’s words.\nStumbling, he fell to the ground, shouted one last denial, and then turned and ran out in a daze.\n\"Tarvok!\" Targon called out, worriedly watching his friend run off in distress. He then turned to his grandfather. After receiving a nod of approval from the elder, he immediately chased after Torvak.\nVelkor watched his grandson’s despairing expression, feeling as though a thousand knives were simultaneously stabbing his ordinary, tender heart. The excruciating pain in his chest made him open his mouth several times, yet no sound emerged.\nFinally, he closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Then he turned his gaze to Krylak and said, \"Krylak, I will accept whatever punishment you deem fit. I only hope that, considering my lifelong dedication to the clan, you can show mercy to Torvak. He has only a month left to live.\"\nVelkor’s face had always carried a look of grim determination, but now, as he spoke his final words, tears streamed down his cheeks.\n\"Who gave you the poison?\" Krylak asked, cutting straight to the point, not ready to agree to anything just yet.\n\"The ninth elder of the Dragon clan,\" Velkor confessed without hesitation. \"He has a cure for my grandson, Velkor. If I eliminated Scion, he promised to treat him. I couldn’t resist the temptation.\"\n\"You made a very unwise move, you know that?\" one of the elders said. He closed his eyes in anguish, unable to bear the sight of his brother’s downfall.\nThe other three elders also closed their eyes, powerless to change the fate of the fifth elder. The crime of plotting against the clan’s prodigy carried only one sentence: death. Even an elder was not exempt.\nEveryone in the hall already knew the fifth elder’s fate. Many began to sob quietly, the weight of the situation heavy on their hearts.\nBut none of them would plead for the fifth elder. It wasn’t out of cold-heartedness, but because forgiving him would mean betraying Scion, who was utterly blameless in all this.\nKrylak took a deep breath, his face somber as he looked at Velkor. \"You knew the consequences. Yet, for your grandson, you chose this path.\"\nVelkor nodded, his tears still flowing. \"Yes, I did. And I accept my fate. But please, consider my grandson’s innocence in all this.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 117: Taking Punishment\nAmong everyone present, Krylak was suffering the most. The words stuck in his throat for a long time before he finally forced them out, his voice trembling.\n\"Velkor, for plotting against the clan’s prodigy, Scion, you are hereby stripped of your elder status, expelled from the tiger clan, and denied entry into the ancestral tomb after your death. You will not receive worship from future generations. Additionally, you will be sent to the Moon Goddess Temple for sacrifice tomorrow.\"\nAfter uttering the last two words, Krylak seemed to have exhausted all his strength and collapsed into his seat, saying no more.\nTorvak, who had run out of the hall earlier, had been eavesdropping outside. When he heard the truth, tears streamed down his face, and it felt like all his strength had been drained. He clung desperately to his mouth, forcing himself to listen until he heard the word \"sacrifice.\"\nThat was the breaking point. He coughed up a mouthful of blood and collapsed in a faint from the overwhelming grief.\n\"Velkor!\" Targon held his friend’s weak shoulders and called out anxiously.\nWhen Torvak didn’t respond, Targon quickly picked him up and ran toward the clan physician’s residence.\nInside the hall, Velkor seemed to sense something and looked toward the entrance. He saw the glaring pool of fresh blood on the ground.\nWith trembling hands, he clenched his eyes shut and rasped, \"Torvak, I accept my guilt and punishment.\"\n\"Velkor, I will take care of Torvak. The underworld is dark; if you’re afraid, just wait for me there. I don’t think I can get over with this easily, so I may see you there very soon. When the time comes, I’ll come find you,\" the Grand Elder, his hair and beard white, spoke with tears in his eyes.\nVelkor’s lips quivered, and he managed a feeble smile. \"Thank you, but I wish you a long life. Just live your life to the fullest, for yourself and for me.\"\nArix, having observed the whole scene, felt sympathy for Velkor but didn’t speak up for him.\nShe knew all too well how dire Scion’s situation had been. If she hadn’t been there, the best Scion could have hoped for would have been death from a psychic power overload. Her heart had grown cold.\nTo her surprise, Scion suddenly spoke, \"I didn’t die, so a sacrifice is unnecessary. The fifth elder has dedicated his life to the clan. Let his merits offset his faults.\"\nWith that, Scion stood up and picked up Arix. Then he left, not sparing another glance at Velkor’s fate.\nThe tiger clan members, hearing this, shook their heads with mixed emotions and began to leave as well.\nVelkor stared in disbelief at Scion’s departing figure. Then, trembling, he stood up to the direction Scion had left.\nHe bowed three times, deep enough that he could barely stood straight again. Then he lifted his head, speaking to the darkness, \"Scion, I’m sorry for doing all that to you. I know I don’t have any chance to see you again in this life, so let’s meet in our next life, and I’ll make amendments for my wrongdoing.\"\nThe turmoil ended with the Fifth Elder being expelled from the Tiger clan, set to leave alone the following day.\nAfter regaining consciousness and learning of the events, Torvak dragged his ailing body to Scion’s villa and begged at the door. He was filled with both guilt and desperation.\n\"Scion, Torvak is still kneeling outside. Should we get someone to help him up?\" Arix asked. She was leaning on the windowsill, looking at Torvak who had been kneeling for hours.\n\"Let him be,\" Scion replied coolly.\nScion continued to address various issues and requests from the Tiger Legion, leaving Arix feeling neglected. She pouted and turned back to observe Torvak at the villa entrance.\n\"Vita, do you know what illness Torvak has?\" Arix asked absentmindedly.\n\"I haven’t examined him, so I can’t be sure, but it looks like premature aging,\" Vita responded, then gave a tentative guess.\n\"Premature aging?\" Arix blinked in curiosity. \"You mean, like, bad-in-bed kind of aging?\"\nVita was silent for a moment before rubbing his forehead and replying, \"It does affect that aspect, but it’s not just that.\"\n\"Oh, so it does affect that. Poor Torvak,\" Arix said sympathetically, looking at Torvak.\n\"Arix, let’s be serious,\" Vita said, both exasperated and indulgent.\n\"Sorry, my bad,\" Arix giggled playfully, sticking out her tongue.\nAfter the playful exchange, Vita noticed Arix still gazing at the person below and seemed to understand something. He asked cautiously, \"Arix, do you want to help him?\"\n\"Yes, he is family after all. Plus, as a healer, I can’t just ignore a patient in need,\" Arix said, feigning helplessness while glancing at the young man cloaked in darkness below.\nTorvak was stubbornly kneeling on the cold ground, despite knowing Scion wouldn’t see him. He was just trying to express his sorry in the most earnest way he knew.\nIt was foolish, but also endearing.\nArix watched Torvak, a smile tugging at her lips.\n\"Then go ahead,\" Vita said, always supporting Arix’s decisions one hundred percent.\n\"Alright.\" Having made up her mind, Arix jumped down from the windowsill, ready to head outside.\n\"Where are you going?\" Scion had just finished a task and looked over at the little cub who had reached the door.\nArix froze mid-step, then turned and answered obediently, \"I want to check on Torvak.\"\nScion was silent for a moment, then resumed his work. He asked casually, \"When will you be back?\"\n\"Not sure, it might take a while,\" Arix replied honestly after thinking for a moment.\n\"Take your time,\" Scion said, his tone softer. \"Just make sure he understands his place in all this.\"\n\"Alright!\" Arix beamed, showing her little sharp teeth. Just as she was about to step outside, Scion’s indifferent voice stopped her in her tracks.\n\"Do your best.\"\nArix’s eyes widened in surprise, then she smiled slightly and responded, \"Okay.\"\nShe continued out the door, while Scion put down his work and slowly walked to the window. He looked down at Torvak, still kneeling at the villa entrance.\nAfter a moment, Scion lifted his hand and opened his opticomputer. Scrolling through countless contacts, he selected one without a name, bearing a completely black avatar.\n\"By dawn tomorrow, I want to hear about the death of the Dragon clan’s ninth elder,\" Scion sent the message coldly.\nThe response came instantly: \"As you wish, sir.\"\nScion calmly shut down his opticomputer, then silently gazed at the full moon outside the window.",

      "content": "Chapter 118: Arix Being Afraid\nAt the villa’s entrance, Torvak knelt, his posture rigid. His face, cold and thin, reflected a mix of guilt and gratitude.\nHe knew this act of kneeling was a bit much and would likely make Scion uneasy, but he felt lost on how else to repay him. He always saw himself as a burden, never truly helpful.\nThis time, the burden felt even heavier because, due to him, his respected grandfather almost became the one who get Scion killed.\nThinking about it, Torvak’s head drooped in shame. His once-clear eyes grew clouded with sadness.\nTears began to fall, heavy and uncontrollable. The thought that he should be the one to die consumed him.\nJust then, Arix reached out a paw and placed it on his arm, checking his pulse.\nIn the midst of his sorrow, Torvak noticed the warm paw on his arm, offering comfort. He looked up, puzzled, and saw a small cub smiling at him. \"Hi, Torvak.\"\nFor a moment, Torvak stared blankly before he remembered this was his cousin, Arix, who had just arrived.\nEmbarrassed that she saw him crying, he quickly wiped his tears and tried to smile. \"Hello, Arix.\"\nArix, seeing the young man smiling through his tears and even with a snot bubble, couldn’t hold back her laughter.\n\"Stop making me laugh; I can’t check you properly,\" she giggled.\nTorvak blinked. Seeing the cub Arix laughing so hard, he turned his head in embarrassment, scratching his neck shyly.\nArix’s interruption had stopped his tears. He thought about how much his cousin liked this little cub.\n’Maybe Scion sent her here?’\nThe more Torvak thought about it, the brighter his eyes became.\nHe looked expectantly at the little cub.\nAfter finishing her laughter, Arix noticed Torvak’s hopeful gaze. She didn’t need to guess what he was thinking. Even though she came to treat Torvak by herself, it could be seen as having Scion’s implicit consent. So, she nodded.\n\"What did Scion ask you to do?\" Torvak asked eagerly.\n’To treat you, of course!’\nArix frowned slightly as she thought about the cause of Torvak’s illness. She started taking out her treatment tools, beginning with a scalpel.\n’What else do I need? Let me think.’\nWhile Arix was thinking, Torvak’s eyes were fixed on the scalpel. ’Is Scion implying I should take my own life to atone? Makes sense. If I had died earlier, I wouldn’t have been a burden to Grandfather and Cousin Scion.\nUnconsciously, Torvak’s hand grasped the scalpel. Slowly, he began to move it toward his neck.\nArix had just taken out a vial to collect some blood when she noticed the scalpel was missing.\nShe looked around, puzzled, but it was nowhere to be seen.\nThen, a glint caught her eye. Looking up, she saw Torvak poised to slit his own throat.\nHer fur stood on end as she jumped up and swatted the scalpel out of his hand. \"What are you doing? Are you crazy? You’re going to kill yourself over something so minor?\" she yelled, her voice a mix of anger and fear.\n\"But... the scalpel was right in front of me. I thought it meant I should take my own life,\" Torvak replied, looking hurt and confused.\nArix was speechless. Sometimes, being naive could easily turn into being foolish, and this guy was a prime example.\nShe almost had a medical disaster on her hands, not because of her treatment but because of his misguided actions.\nTaking a deep breath to calm herself, Arix managed to suppress the \"colorful\" language she wanted to use.\n\"Torvak, just put your hand out. Now, have you considered that, it’s possible that the scalpel was meant for drawing blood?\" Arix used her psychic power to control the scalpel and made a small cut on Torvak’s finger.\nOnce the vial was filled with blood, she applied some ointment to his wound.\nWatching his finger heal quickly, Torvak realized he had misunderstood the situation. He coughed awkwardly and asked, \"So, what does Cousin Scion need my blood for?\"\n\"It’s not Scion who needs your blood, it’s me,\" Arix explained patiently, fearing that if she didn’t clarify, Torvak might misunderstand again and cause more trouble. \"I need your blood to study why you’re aging prematurely.\"\nTorvak seemed to feel quite embarrassed knowing that his secret had been found. Hearing Arix’s explanation, he almost choked on his own spit and coughed violently.\nFinally catching his breath, he blushed and protested loudly, \"I am not! Don’t say such things.\"\nArix nodded, trying to keep a straight face. \"Right, you don’t.\"\nTorvak puffed out his cheeks in anger. Huffing, he turned away in a fit of rare bad temper.\nArix gathered the materials she needed and was about to leave. But seeing Torvak, still adorable even while sulking, she softened. \"Torvak, you should go back early too. I believe Scion has never blamed you guys.\" With that, Arix turned and walked away.\nTorvak, still kneeling, froze at Arix’s words. Even though he didn’t get up, the heavy burden on his chest that made it hard to breathe seemed to lift with her voice.\nHis lips curved slightly, and his usually clear eyes no longer appeared so dim.\nTorvak looked up at the villa, focusing on the only window still lit. He spoke loudly, as if talking to himself, \"Scion, thank you for forgiving Grandpa. I’m sorry for the harm Grandpa and I caused you, but in this lifetime, I probably won’t have a chance to repay you. If there is a next life, I want to be your mecha to repay and protect you!\"\nWith that, Torvak bowed heavily three times. Then, he turned back and left the villa’s entrance.\nStanding by the window, Scion silently listened to the young man’s words. Then, with a rare hint of disdain in his tone, he closed the curtain and muttered, \"Not necessary.\"\nThe next morning, Arix, who had worked all night, stumbled out of the lab, her eyelids heavy. She was so exhausted that she nearly fell.\nStaying up all night was like hell for a little cub like her; it was no less challenging than her previous physical power training.\nBut, she finally managed to make the detox potion for Torvak.\nCreating the potion wasn’t the issue; it was the interstellar virus that had evolved unexpectedly.\nCan you imagine the frustration? Arix dropped the antidote into Torvak’s poisoned blood, saw it turn back to a healthy red, and then, just like that, it turned black again, becoming resistant to her antidote.\nTalk about a slap in the face!\nHer determination hardened. If she didn’t create an effective antidote by the end of the night, she’d admit defeat to the virus.\nSo, she spent the entire night watching the blood change from red to black and back again.\nWhen the blood finally stayed red, Arix almost thought she was dreaming.\nAfter checking multiple times to make sure it was real, she nearly cried from relief.\nAt last, she could sleep.\nBut before that, knowing Torvak might leave the clan today, Arix wanted to hand over the potion to Scion to ensure she could rest peacefully.\nShe staggered all the way to Scion’s room, even bumping her forehead somewhere, leaving a small bump.\nScion sensed her approaching and opened the door just as she reached it.\n\"Arix, you took your time,\" Scion said, his voice carrying concern rather than blame.\nArix barely lifted her eyelids. She handed over the detox potion from her Space Button, and placed it on the floor.\n\"Torvak’s detoxification potion, Scion, please give it to him,\" she managed to say before collapsing and falling asleep right there.\nScion’s heart tightened. He quickly picked her up, checked her condition, and sighed with relief when he saw she was just asleep.\nLooking at the exhausted Arix, he felt a mix of helplessness and fondness. He gently patted her head.\nSeeing the small bump on her forehead, he paused, then took out some ointment and gently applied it to the bump.\nAfter finishing, Scion used his psychic power to pick up the potion from the ground without giving it a second glance.\nHe first went into the room, gently placed Arix on the bed. He covered her with a small blanket, making sure she wouldn’t catch a cold.\nOnly then did Scion turn his attention to the potion in his hand. It was still a dark, black liquid, but this time it had a hint of red compared to the psychic power healing potion he had drunk before.\nThinking about the last time, Scion’s eyes flashed with curiosity as he opened the bottle cap.\nBefore he could even get close to smell it, a bitter, acrid, and slightly spicy scent hit his nose.\nScion quickly put the cap back on, his expression showing rare sympathy.",

      "content": "Chapter 119: Tarvork Cured\nAt the entrance of the clan estate, Krylak, the leader of the Tiger clan, stood with four elders. They were bidding farewell to Velkor.\nSurprisingly, Torvak was also there.\nAt this moment, Krylak put his hand on Torvak’s shoulder and said, \"Are you sure about this? Won’t you reconsider?\"\n\"Thank you, but I want to spend my remaining time with my grandfather,\" Torvak replied, looking at his grandfather standing beside him. He then smiled and shook his head at Krylak.\nVelkor did not object and affectionately patted Tarvok’s hair with a kind smile.\nSeeing the determination in both the grandfather and grandson, Krylak did not argue further. He sighed and said, \"Alright, here are two spacecraft tickets to Planet Sapphire and some supplies. Please accept them as my final gesture of help.\"\nHesitating if he should take the two tickets and the Space Button handed to him, Torvak glanced at his grandfather.\nVelkor nodded, indicating he should accept them.\nTorvak then took the tickets and Space Button, expressing his gratitude to Krylak, \"Thank you.\"\nKrylak smiled and nodded. The four elders also took out their prepared Space Buttons and handed them to Torvak.\nFeeling touched, Torvak and Velkor accepted everyone’s kindness. After a few more words, Velkor prepared to leave with Torvak.\nJust then, Scion’s servant hurriedly arrived.\nSeeing that Velkor and the others had not yet left, the servant breathed a sigh of relief.\n\"Young Master, the admiral has something for you,\" the servant said, handing the black potion to Torvak.\n\"Is this really from Cousin Scion?\" Torvak exclaimed joyfully.\nEveryone present was equally surprised, staring at the potion in the servant’s hand in astonishment.\n\"Yes, Admiral Scion gave it to me and said it would treat you. He said you should drink it now. It will cure your illness,\" the servant said, trying to relay the admiral’s message succinctly.\nThe crowd fell silent at these words.\nEven Torvak was stunned.\nIf it hadn’t been the admiral who said this, no one would have believed the potion could do magic.\nBut Velkor heard it clearly. He excitedly took the potion, opened the bottle, and quickly handed it to Torvak, saying, \"Drink it, now.\"\nTorvak still found it hard to believe he could be saved, but hearing his grandfather’s words, he nodded in a daze.\nHe took the potion and, under the expectant gazes of everyone present, drank it all in one go.\n\"How do you feel? Do you feel any better?\" Velkor asked, looking at Torvak with concern.\nTorvak frowned, not answering his grandfather’s question. His mind was full of how awful the potion tasted.\nBut thinking that this potion could cure the illness that had plagued him for years, he forced himself not to throw up.\nAs the horrible taste finally faded, before he could say anything, he began to vomit black blood, mouthful after mouthful.\nThis dreadful scene alarmed everyone, who quickly gathered around in worry.\nKrylak immediately picked Torvak up and rushed back to the estate to find a doctor.\nLying in Krylak’s arms, Torvak actually didn’t feel any discomfort, except that he couldn’t stop vomiting blood.\nAnd strangely enough, the more he vomited, the better he felt.\nAlthough Torvak was puzzled, seeing the worried looks on everyone’s faces, he wanted to reassure them that he was fine.\nBut with his mouth continuously spewing black blood, he couldn’t say anything.\nMoreover, his blood-soaked appearance scared everyone into moving even faster, leaving no time to notice his attempt to speak.\n...\nDr. Morkai of the Tiger clan was lounging in his garden, enjoying a peaceful breakfast. He took a sip of goat milk, closed his eyes, and let the rich, creamy flavor spread across his taste buds.\nAfter finishing his milk, he picked up a golden toothpick, speared a small blueberry, and popped it into his mouth. The sweet and tangy taste made him squint with delight.\nThe weather was perfect, and so was his mood.\nAs the only doctor in this clan, this was the kind of life he felt he deserved.\nThinking about Torvak, the little rascal leaving the clan today, Morkai couldn’t help but feel a bit of satisfaction. Yet, he also felt a wave of joy.\nThat little troublemaker had been a thorn in his side for over a decade.\nNo matter what Morkai was doing, there was always a patient named Torvak who was disrupting his peace.\nFor example, whenever Morkai finally managed to fall asleep after struggling with insomnia, frantic knocking would sound outside his bedroom.\n\"Dr. Morkai! Help! Torvak has passed out!\"\nMorkai would open his bloodshot eyes, and glare towards the door like a ghost. Then, he’d take a deep breath, and grudgingly get up to make a house call.\nAnother time, just as Morkai speared a piece of meat with his fork during a meal, someone would burst in out of nowhere, grab him, and run while explaining anxiously.\n\"Dr. Morkai, sorry to bother you, but saving a life is urgent! Torvak is in critical condition!!\"\nWith a blank expression, Morkai would listen while still managing to eat the meat on his fork.\nBut the most annoying time was when he was in the middle of relieving himself, and the knocking started on the bathroom door.\n\"Dr. Morkai! Help! Torvak is vomiting blood!\"\nMorkai’s hand stopped, and he let out a furious roar.\nRemembering these bitter moments, Morkai quietly speared another blueberry, trying to let the sweetness comfort his wounded heart.\nBut before he could put the blueberry in his mouth, there was a knock on the door.\nMorkai frowned, puzzled as to who would need a doctor so early in the morning.\n\"Dr. Morkai! Help! Help! Torvak is vomiting a lot of blood!!!\" Krylak shouted anxiously.\nSnap—!\nThe golden toothpick in Morkai’s hand broke. He looked up at the sky with lifeless eyes, took a deep breath, then got up to open the door.\nWhat he saw was Torvak, covered in blood.\nMorkai’s frown deepened, and he quickly set aside his complaints to examine Torvak’s body.\nIt didn’t take long before Morkai suddenly looked up, his eyes filled with shock and disbelief, staring at Torvak.\n\"Dr. Morkai, how is Torvak?\" Velkor asked worriedly.\nMorkai frowned, staying silent. He then stood up and led the way, saying, \"Come with me to the treatment room for a detailed examination.\"\nVelkor and the others, without any doubt, quickly followed.\nHalf an hour later...\nMorkai stared at the virtual screen with a mix of emotions. The health report displayed a single short line: \"Healthy, slight anemia.\"\nHe knew what each of those words meant, but together, they formed a conclusion that baffled him. Torvak was really healed.\n’Is the person who treated him a genius, or am I just not good enough?’\nFor the past decade, Morkai had scoured countless ancient texts, yet he had never found a way to save Torvak.\n’So how did this mystery person manage to do it?’\nHe wondered.\nConfounded, Morkai turned to Velkor and asked, \"Has Torvak received any treatment recently?\"\nVelkor shook his head, then tentatively added, \"Recently, besides from you, Torvak hasn’t received any treatment from others. But just now, after drinking the potion sent by Admiral Scion, he started vomiting black blood continuously. So, what’s wrong with Torvak?\"\n\"The admiral, huh.\" Morkai lowered his eyes, deep in thought. After a while, he looked up at the group and said, \"Torvak is fine now. I mean, he is completely cured.\"\nEveryone was stunned, exchanging looks of disbelief. Velkor, in particular, asked with difficulty, \"Are you serious? Is Torvak really cured?\"\n\"Yes,\" Morkai nodded affirmatively.\nUpon receiving this confirmation, Velkor burst into tears, collapsing to his knees and crying out in regret, \"It was Scion who saved Torvak! Gosh... He saved Torvak. Look at what I’ve done to him!\"\nThe person he had wronged save his closest kin. That was no better than a direct slap on his face, although that also made him glad.\nThe others present understood the gravity of the situation. Apart from a heavy sigh, they remained silent.\nMorkai’s feelings were different from theirs. He found them noisy and irritating. Besides his curiosity about the admiral’s potion, his mind was only on the breakfast he had yet to finish in the garden.\nThinking about the blueberries still waiting for him, Morkai mercilessly issued an order to leave, \"Since it’s all good now, take him out.\"\nIgnoring their reactions, Morkai left the treatment room.\nKrylak and the four elders were left staring at each other. They sighed and stayed behind.\nBack in his garden, Morkai resumed his small breakfast, savoring the delicious bites while watching the birds flit among the flowers. His soul felt lighter, and even the frustration from earlier melted away.\nAfter finishing his meal, Morkai leisurely turned on his opticomputer and initiated a video call to Scion.\n\"Uncle Morkai,\" Scion answered quickly.\n\"Torvak is fine now. By the way, the potion you gave him, who was the Master Chemist that made it?\" Morkai asked, curiosity piqued.\n\"It wasn’t a Master Chemist,\" Scion replied calmly.\nMorkai looked at Scion in surprise and asked, \"Then who was it?\"\nScion remained silent, just looking at him quietly.\nMorkai understood that this was something he couldn’t talk about. He pouted and said, \"Then can you at least get me a potion for my own research?\"\n\"No,\" Scion said with a poker face, continuing to look at him quietly.\nMorkai understood again; this meant he was being annoyed. So, without further ado, he hung up the call. He thought resentfully about Scion’s expressionless face, wondering who besides ignorant women would want to see it.\n’Recently, there hasn’t been any chemist around Scion. Who could have made this potion?’\nMorkai wondered, scratching his chin and falling into deep thought.",

      "content": "Chapter 120: Guests From The Alliance\nMorkai spent a long time deep in thought, trying to come up with an answer. Just when he was about to give up, a small cub popped into his mind.\nHe sat quietly for a bit, then quickly opened his opticomputer and typed \"Arix\" into the search bar. In seconds, loads of info about Arix filled the virtual screen.\n’But why are all the profile pictures blacked out?’\nFrowning, Morkai clicked on an introduction about Arix on the interstellarnet.\nArix, female, a citizen of the Alliance from Hecaris, held the rank of Student Officer in the Fifth Legion.\nBorn in Hecaris’ capital, she faced an insectoid invasion during a training competition in September 3098. To save her classmates, she fought fearlessly until she was sucked into a black hole and sacrificed herself.\nKey Achievements:\n- Third lady of the Kering family, one of the five major families.\n- Ranked in the top 10 in the entrance exams of the Alliance’s five military academies.\n- Single-handedly sealed a wormhole in Hecaris’ capital until the Fifth Legion arrived.\n- Major researcher and inventor of the psychic power healing potion.\n- Posthumously awarded the highest honor medal of the Alliance by the President.\n\"Dead? Could the cub just have the same name?\" Morkai frowned, drumming his fingers on the table.\n\"No!\" He suddenly sat up straight. \"There might be many named Arix, but a Tiger clan cub named Arix? There can only be one... My niece Fleur! She married a Kering and her kid’s named Arix!\" Morkai’s eyes lit up with excitement.\n\"No wonder she could save Torvak. Someone who invented psychic power healing potions could easily handle such a minor illness,\" Morkai finally realized.\nThe name Arix in the potion world signifies someone who overcame psychic power terminal illness. When the psychic power healing potion first appeared, it astonished many potion masters across the Empire too. Even the Master Chemist of the Empire wanted to visit Arix in the Alliance.\nAmong these admirers was Morkai himself. He never expected the person he always wanted to meet was now in the clan!\nMorkai felt like a fan about to meet their idol, both nervous and thrilled. Though Arix was his, well, grandniece, he couldn’t act superior. In the chemistry world, the rule is that the accomplished ones are the teachers, and his granddaughter Arix was definitely far ahead of him.\nAnd what’s a little loss of dignity compared to this? Others would jump at the chance!\nThe more he thought about it, the more excited he got. Morkai immediately stood up to find Arix and ask her about the problems that had puzzled him for so long. But as soon as he stepped out the door, he realized he didn’t know where the cub lived.\nAfter a long moment of silence, Morkai closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and then video-called Scion.\n\"Uncle Morkai,\" Scion greeted, answering the video call as usual.\nMorkai hesitated, feeling awkward. Revealing someone’s secret was tough, especially in front of Scion.\nAfter a long silence, Scion’s eyebrows started to knit together, clearly getting impatient.\nMorkai knew he had to speak up now or miss his chance. \"Uh... where does my grandniece, Arix, live? I need to talk to her about something,\" he asked, trying to sound casual.\nScion looked surprised at the mention of Arix but quickly masked his reaction. \"She’s here, resting. Now isn’t a good time.\"\nSeeing Scion’s expression that clearly warned,\n’If you wake her, you’ll regret it,’\nMorkai swallowed the rest of his words and tried to change the subject. \"By the way, given Arix’s contributions to the Alliance, why haven’t they sent anyone to bring her back?\"\nScion’s face darkened slightly. \"They have.\"\nMorkai’s curiosity was piqued. \"Who is it?\" he asked eagerly.\nScion remained silent, his expression cold.\nMorkai could barely contain his amusement. It was rare to see Scion at a loss. Trying to hold back his laughter, he cleared his throat. \"Well, I have some things to do. I’ll hang up now.\"\nWithout waiting for Scion’s response, Morkai ended the call and burst into laughter. The sound echoed through his room.\nAs the day turned into afternoon, Arix, who had been sleeping soundly on Scion’s bed, finally woke up, yawning in satisfaction.\n\"Mm.\" Arix sat up, rubbing her eyes with her paws. When she lowered her paws, she saw an unexpected face.\nShe quickly rubbed her eyes again, muttering, \"I must still be dreaming. How else would I see Drexel, that skunk?\"\n\"Who are you calling a skunk?\" Drexel’s eyes narrowed dangerously, his tone threatening.\nArix froze, lowering her paws and studying Drexel carefully. She confirmed she wasn’t seeing things.\nWith a shocked expression, Arix held her face in her paws. \"Drexel! What are you doing in the Empire?!\"\n\"What do you mean by that? Am I not welcome here?\" Drexel crossed his arms, lifting his chin and huffing coldly.\nHis stern facade lasted only a few seconds before he switched to a mischievous grin. He picked up Arix and nuzzled her head enthusiastically, laughing like a happy fool. \"And if I hadn’t come to the Empire, how could I see my sister’s beast form? Huh! Just as adorable as I imagined!\"\nArix, still groggy, was caught off guard and nuzzled several times by Drexel before she could react. Instantly, she felt a wave of reluctance and struggled to push him away with her front paws, trying to pry his face off her.\n\"Drexel, enough already! How old are you? This is gross!\" Arix was utterly repulsed, wishing her neck could stretch just a bit longer to keep her distance from Drexel’s face. Seriously, nuzzling? Stay away!\nAfter a series of intense struggles, Drexel’s face was left covered in scratches. He looked at Arix with a pitiful expression, clearly feeling wronged.\nAll he wanted was to be close to his little sister, and yet he ended up getting beaten.\n’I got to be the most unfortunate brother in the universe?’\nAfter pinning Drexel down, Arix took a moment to smooth her ruffled fur.\nOnce satisfied, she lifted her chin coolly and asked, \"Alright, spill it. What are you really doing in the Empire?\"\n\"Obviously, I missed you,\" Drexel said with a grin. But Arix’s unimpressed look made him cough awkwardly and add, \"Okay, that’s part of it. The main reason I’m here is to protect you for the Alliance.\"\n\"But hasn’t the Hecaris Military Academy already started? Won’t this mess with your studies?\" Arix tilted her head, puzzled.\n\"No worries. I am a genius, and you know that. Studying is easy for me,\" Drexel bragged.\nArix rolled her eyes and swatted at him. \"Be serious!\"\n\"Fine, fine. No need to get rough. You’ve been hanging out with Cirilla too much, turning into a real tomboy,\" Drexel muttered.\nUnder Arix’s narrowing gaze, Drexel finally gave in and explained, \"I can understand you in your beast form, so Mom sent me to test our bloodline and join you in receiving the Moon Goddess’s blessing.\"\n\"Oh, right. I forgot you can understand beast form talk,\" Arix said, realizing. Then she asked, \"Do you have a beast form?\"\n\"Nope, but I’ve got beastly instincts. Does that count?\" Drexel joked, letting out a playful howl.\n\"Get lost!\" Arix retorted, rolling her eyes.\nDespite the banter, Arix was genuinely happy to see her brother. Having family in a foreign land brought a sense of security, making Arix feel more at ease. It was like walking on a high wire and finally having someone to share the journey with.\nBut this moment of comfort didn’t last long. Suddenly, a pile of textbooks appeared in front of Arix.\nArix was puzzled.\n\"Oh, I almost forgot. Arix, these are the textbooks from your school. This opticomputer is for your online classes. Here’s your previous opticomputer and Space Button. Also, you haven’t chosen your major yet, so the president wants to discuss it with you,\" Drexel said, contacting Gunder and connecting a translator to avoid any communication issues.\n’Wait, hold on! I haven’t decided on a major yet!’\nArix screamed internally, but before she could react, the virtual screen lit up with the smiling face of President Gunder.",

      "content": "Chapter 121: Arix’s Choice\n\"Hello, Miss Kering,\" Gunder greeted warmly.\nArix choked back her words, forcing a strained smile. \"Hello, President Gunder.\"\nPresident Gunder smiled kindly and nodded. Then he began, \"I wanted to know if you’ve decided on your major. Oh, before that, there’s something I haven’t told you yet. The Department of Mecha Manufacture you initially chose remains unchanged, but studying in the Department of Chemistry is now mandatory for you. I’m sure you understand the reason and I don’t have to explain.\"\nArix nodded obediently, as these were the two departments she had planned to choose anyway.\nGunder smiled with satisfaction and continued, \"Additionally, the mentor from the Psychic Ware Department is very interested in you and has been eagerly anticipating your enrollment. You won’t turn this down, right?\"\nArix was surprised. She felt something was off, but she was indeed interested in Psychic Ware, so she hesitantly nodded.\n\"And since your physical power is quite weak, I suggest you also studying from Department of Combat. How else will you build your strength? Given your talent, you’ll surely need to handle mechas in the future, right?\" Gunder’s words were logical and convincing.\nArix found herself nodding along.\n\"Also, Arix, you already have a military rank. It’s certain that you’ll enter the corps after graduation. With your talents, you’re destined to become a great officer. How can an officer not know how to command? So, adding the Department of Strategy and Commanding is essential, don’t you think?\" Gunder’s tone was firm and persuasive, as if he was doing her a great favor.\nArix: ...\n’Wow! He’s treating me like an all-rounder!’\nShe loved doing research but had no interest in fighting or commanding.\n\"President, um, I think...\" Arix began to object, intending to drop the last two departments.\nBut before she could finish, Gunder interrupted, \"I know you think these choices are excellent, so it’s settled. I won’t take up any more of your time. Goodbye!\" With that, Gunder hurriedly ended the call.\nArix stared at the blank screen, stunned. She turned to Drexel and asked, \"What did I just agree to?\"\nDrexel looked at his sister with sympathy. \"You didn’t really agree to anything, but the president took it as agreement. So now you’re enrolled in five departments.\"\n’What the heck!’\nArix finally realized what had happened. She immediately tried to contact Gunder. She could tolerate joining the Psychic Ware Department, but she had no intention of studying combat and commanding!\nJoining a department wasn’t just about waiting for graduation. There were assignments, yearly exams, and final graduation tests. Failing meant being held back, and being held back meant not graduating on time.\nThe thought of being held back made Arix more anxious as she waited for Gunder to answer the call. Her pride wouldn’t allow her to be a held-back student.\nThe call rang for what seemed like an eternity.\nDrexel couldn’t bear it and said, \"Arix, just accept it. The president is doing this on purpose. Once the enrollment procedures are completed, it can’t be changed. The president probably won’t take your call until then.\"\nArix had a strong urge to curse, but she held it back... Yes! Held back! See? Already!\nIn the Hecaris Military Academy president’s office...\nMarlone silently observed the entire process of President Gunder setting up Arix. With a rare pang of conscience, he hesitated and asked, \"Isn’t this too much? Regular students only take one.\"\nGunder said, clutching his head in frustration, \"Is Arix anywhere near a regular? Do you think I want to do this? My hands are tied! The Department of Chemistry is already up in arms over Arix not being enrolled yet. And then there’s the Psychic Ware Department. Those old folks are envious that Arix developed a potion for psychic power treatment. They think a genius like her should join their department, hoping she might create a Psychic Ware for treating psychic power. They even threatened to resign and move to the Mulado Military Academy if Arix doesn’t join. Do you know how hard it is to find a Psychic Ware mentor these days?\"\n\"What about the Mecha Department of Combat and the Department of Strategy and Command?\" Marlone asked meekly.\n\"Do you think the heads of those departments would let a Supergiant+ slip away easily?\" Gunder retorted with a cold laugh.\nMarlone fell silent. He couldn’t decide whether to sympathize with the president or with the poor Arix.\n’Ah, having such an exceptional talent is also a hassle. But wait... Why am I smiling?’\nArix switched back to her old opticomputer and stared blankly at the screen. Notifications popped up one after another.\n\"Congratulations, Arix, you have joined the Department of Chemistry.\"\n\"Congratulations, Arix, you have joined the Department of Psychic Ware.\"\n\"Congratulations, Arix, you have joined the Department of Mecha Manufacture.\"\n\"Congratulations, Arix, you have joined the Department of Strategy and Commanding.\"\n\"Congratulations, Arix, you have successfully joined the Department of Mecha Pilot.\"\nDrexel, standing nearby, was floored. \"Wow, Arix, there are only seven departments, and you got into five of them!\"\n\"Do you think it’s too late to drop out?\" Arix asked, feeling a wave of dizziness at the thought of her future as a military student. Even a workhorse had it easier.\n\"Arix, I advise against such dangerous thoughts unless you want to face Dad and Mom in anger,\" Drexel said, grinning. He had a knack for bringing others down when he was in the same boat. Seeing Arix struggle with her classes would weirdly make him happy.\nArix rolled her eyes at his gloating face. \"You’re such a great brother.\"\n\"Well, it’s Saturday, and classes start on Monday. How about we go out and meet some family from the Empire?\" Drexel suggested, like an overexcited puppy eager to play.\nArix remembered she hadn’t prepared gifts for the relatives and rummaged through her old Space Button. Seeing a bunch of potions inside, she nodded reluctantly. \"Fine, we can give out the gifts too.\"\n\"Awesome! Let’s go!\" Drexel picked up Arix and headed out.\nAs they opened the bedroom door, they found Scion standing in the hallway.\n\"Sir,\" Drexel greeted politely.\nScion’s face stiffened, and he coldly nodded at Drexel, ignoring him afterward.\n\"Scion, are you done with your work?\" Arix’s mood brightened at the sight of the handsome man. Her earlier gloom vanished instantly, and she eagerly asked.\n\"Arix, he’s young but has a higher rank. Isn’t it inappropriate to call him ’Scion’?\" Drexel whispered to Arix.\nArix turned to glare at Drexel, her eyes saying, \"Say another word and I’ll...\"\nDrexel shut up immediately. Arix’s love for good-looking people was something that needed fixing.\nShe turned back to Scion, smiling sweetly and innocently.\nScion gave a reserved nod, his gaze softening as he looked at Arix. \"They are cooking now. What would you like tonight, Arix?\"\n\"Steak!\" Arix’s eyes lit up as she licked her lips. Juicy, tender steak with a dash of black pepper—absolutely divine!\n\"Okay, steak it is tonight,\" Scion said with a slight, indulgent smile.\nDrexel stood there, feeling a bit overlooked. ’Why is no one asking me? I want lamb chops...’\nBut Arix and Scion completely ignored him, lost in their own conversation.\n\"So, Arix, where are you headed?\" Scion asked casually.\nArix remembered their plans and began transferring potions from her Space Button to a ring-shaped Space Button. She handed it to Scion. \"Scion, this is a gift for you.\"\nScion’s eyes flickered with surprise. He examined the ring for a moment before looking at Arix. \"For me?\"\n\"Yes,\" Arix nodded.\nScion’s gaze softened, and he carefully took the ring, slipping it onto his index finger. \"Thank you, I like it a lot.\" He smiled, gently touching the ring.\n\"You’re welcome.\" Arix was happy to see him pleased. But remembering their plans, she turned to Drexel urgently. \"Let’s go quickly, Drexel. We need to give out the gifts and come back for dinner. Scion, we’ll be back soon.\"\n\"Alright.\" Drexel had been itching to leave. Hearing his sister, he immediately started moving.\nThey left so quickly that they didn’t notice Scion’s smile stiffen.\n\"So, it’s not just for me,\" Scion murmured, a rare hint of disappointment in his voice.\nOutside the villa, Drexel finally asked, \"Arix, you don’t happen to like Scion, do you?\"\n\"Of course I do,\" Arix answered without hesitation.\n’Scion is so good-looking; who wouldn’t like him?’\nDrexel gasped, feeling the urge to shake some sense into her. \"Sis! Where’s your sense of dignity? Where’s your shyness?\"\nSuppressing his emotions, he nervously asked, \"And who do you love? Is it him too?\"\n\"No,\" Arix shook her head just as quickly.\nDrexel was shocked. \"What a heartbreaker!\"\nThough he disapproved of his sister’s fickleness, Drexel was more curious. Whispering as if sharing a secret, he asked, \"So, who do you love?\"\n\"I love mechas, of course! I’m going to build legendary mechas one day. Right now, I only love them.\" Arix’s eyes sparkled with determination, already planning to dive into her freshman mecha textbooks after dinner.\nDrexel was at a loss. \"What the heck, you just love mechas?\"\nThough exasperated, Drexel realized one thing: Arix was still just a clueless kid. Her liking for Scion was probably just because of his looks, like how fangirls adore celebrities. They claim to be head over heels, but in the end, they marry someone else.\n\"Arix, have you ever thought about getting married in the future? Like to someone like Scion? He may not be as outstanding as me, though,\" Drexel joked. \"But you have to admit, he’s pretty outstanding! He’s already an admiral in the Empire at such a young age!\"\nArix looked at Drexel with disdain. \"Are you sure Scion is no better than you?\"\n\"Ahem, that’s not the point,\" Drexel turned away, coughing awkwardly.\nArix snorted in disapproval, then answered Drexel’s question seriously. \"Marriage requires love, and love comes with anxiety, suspicion, and caution. So, instead of indulging in some tragic romance, I’d rather read more books about mechas.\"\nHearing Arix speak so confidently, Drexel couldn’t help but feel a bit disdainful inside. Look at her, so clueless. If she wasn’t his sister, he’d probably mock her thoroughly.\nBut he realized he was losing hope in changing Arix’s views on love. At this rate, the chance of her having a future husband was slimmer than winning the lottery.",

      "content": "Chapter 122: Targon Meeting Drexel\nArix and Drexel strolled leisurely towards the villa, which was the first to visit on their list.\n\"Targon, open up!\" Arix yelled with enthusiasm.\nThe villa door creaked open, and Targon poked his head out, eyeing Arix suspiciously.\n\"Hey, cuz, what brings you here? And who’s this?\" Targon asked, his gaze shifting to Drexel.\n\"This is my brother, Drexel. Drexel, meet our cousin, Targon,\" Arix introduced them with a grin.\nArix had a feeling that her brother and Targon would hit it off. Both had been at the receiving end of her antics more times than they’d like to admit.\nHer feelings was true. As soon as Targon heard that Drexel was Arix’s brother, he gave him a look filled with understanding and sympathy. Having Arix as a sister was no easy feat.\n\"Nice to meet you, Drexel,\" Targon said warmly, stepping out to shake hands. His friendliness was so genuine, it dispelled any awkwardness.\nDrexel, taken aback by Targon’s enthusiasm, thought he might be naturally outgoing. But when Targon leaned in and whispered, \"Has she tricked you too?\" Drexel realized they were kindred spirits.\n\"Targon, I feel like we’ve known each other forever. We’re destined to be friends!\" Drexel replied, shaking his hand eagerly.\nDuring their visit, Drexel and Targon chatted like old friends, sharing knowing glances about Arix. As their time drew to a close, they lingered at the villa’s door, reluctant to part ways.\nArix was aware of the time and she knew they needed to visit more people before dinner. So she cut in. \"Targon, here’s the surprise I told you about yesterday. Don’t forget to check it out. We have to go now.\"\n\"Will do. Take care, Drexel. See you soon,\" Targon said, waving as Drexel followed Arix to the next villa.\nAfter they left, Targon thought to himself, \"Drexel’s really patient. If I had a little demon sister like Arix, I’d probably have to teach her a thing or two about respect every day.\"\nWith a chuckle, Targon looked down at the surprise Arix had given him. The packaging was impressive, featuring a temporary Space Button. Space buttons like this were costly, around 2000 credits, and usually reserved for special gifts.\nIntrigued, Targon raised an eyebrow and used his psychic power to explore the contents of the Space Button.\n\"Holy crap!\" Targon yelled, rubbing his eyes in disbelief.\nInside the Space Button were ten vials of psychic power healing potion!\nTargon remembered that Arix had once gifted two vials of this potion, which had thrilled their grandfather to no end.\nBut ten vials? That was insane!\nThough each Psychic Healer from the Alliance cost around 100,000 astrocredits, the Empire could only get them through gray market channels, where the price often skyrocketed tenfold. Even then, they were hard to come by.\nThe most crucial detail about these gifts was that The packaging was so simple, almost laughable.\nIn the Empire, anyone with a Psychic Healer would store it in an expensive gemstone box. Considering Arix had once mentioned that making potions wasn’t difficult, the truth was clear to Targon: Arix had made these potions herself!\nRealizing this, Targon understood why Drexel pampered Arix so much. She wasn’t just a little sister; she was a goldmine!\nTargon was so eager to know if it was too late to start pampering her now.\nAs dusk settled, Arix and Drexel finally finished visiting all their relatives.\nReflecting on their overly enthusiastic family members, Arix and Drexel shivered a bit.\nHanding out psychic power healing potions made them nearly revered. Some relatives wouldn’t even let them go, treating them like precious gems.\nThe Alliance’s \"specialty\" turned them into the most popular members of the Tiger clan that afternoon. Some relatives, having heard about their visit, even waited at the door to welcome them.\nBut the relatives didn’t just take the potions for free. Almost every household stuffed them with valuable gifts from the Empire.\n\"Arix, how about we visit more families sometime?\" Drexel suggested, smiling as he patted his Space Button, now brimming with gifts.\nArix, too tired to scold her naive brother, sighed. Her fur had been nearly petted off during the visits.\nGently patting her fur, Arix replied disdainfully, \"If you want to go, go by yourself. I can really use some moments of peace now.\"\nSeeing Arix’s disinterest, Drexel dropped the idea, though he couldn’t help feeling a bit regretful about missing out on more gifts.\nWhen they returned to Scion’s villa, Arix kicked Drexel aside and quickly flew into Scion’s arms, whining, \"Scion, look, my fur is almost gone.\"\nScion was sitting in the living room, engrossed in a book, when suddenly a furry ball jumped into his lap, whimpering pitifully.\nWith a mix of helplessness and affection, he put down his book and looked at the fluffy little cub who was almost a puffball. He patted her small head, a hint of amusement in his voice. \"No, you look just fine.\"\n\"Ha! Since you’re saying I look fine, then fine it is,\" Arix cooed, nuzzling Scion’s palm like a spoiled child.\n\"Are you hungry? Let’s go eat,\" Scion suggested, picking up the little cub and heading toward the dining room.\nThey both forgot about Drexel, who was still in the living room. It wasn’t until Arix suddenly remembered and called out, \"Drexel, dinner!\"\n\"Coming,\" said Drexel, who felt a bit like an invisible man. He responded gratefully.\nLooks like Arix wasn’t completely forgetting him; she still remembered to call him for dinner. So there was still hope!\nDuring dinner, Arix used her fork, specially designed for her tiger paws. She picked up the pre-cut steak and eagerly popped it into her mouth, chewing with delight.\nMeanwhile, Scion and Drexel handled their forks and knives with precision, cutting their steaks gracefully like young nobles.\n\"Hey Arix, ever tried searching your name on the interstellarnet? Better do it now, or you might miss out tomorrow,\" Drexel said with a wink after swallowing a bite of his steak.\nArix was about to take a sip of water when Drexel’s suggestion caught her off guard. She had a feeling this wouldn’t end well. But curiosity got the better of her. She looked down and commanded her opticomputer’s AI, \"PP Boy, open the interstellarnet and search for Arix.\"\n\"Sure, searching for Arix Kering,\" the AI replied. In seconds, a torrent of information about her appeared on the virtual screen.\n\"Pfft...\" Arix choked on her water at the sight of the search results. Her appetite vanished as she put down her fork and kept scrolling through the screen.\n\"No way! Even if I fell into a black hole, I’d still be fine. Why are they already writing my obituary?\" Arix was so frustrated she felt like she might cough up blood.\nPlanet Waste had spread rumors about her before, but now they were flat-out declaring her dead.\n’What will they claim next? That I’m coming back as a zombie?’\n\"Well, you did fall into a black hole. If it was a wormhole, you might survive. Cassian had survived that with his Supergiant+ physical and psychic powers. But no one’s ever made it out of a black hole alive. By the way, Arix, how did you escape?\" Drexel asked, intrigued.\n\"I was saved, but I don’t know by whom. I only remember an old man,\" Arix recalled, picturing an elderly man with a white beard and mustache. She was almost sure he was the one who rescued her.\nShe felt it a pity that she couldn’t remember him more clearly. It felt like someone had intentionally wiped that part of her memory.\n\"Whoever it was, the Kering family owes him big time,\" Drexel said, clasping his hands in a gesture of thanks before returning to his meal.\n\"Arix, you fell into a black hole?\" Scion put down his knife and fork, looking at her with concern.\nArix didn’t react much, but Drexel paused his eating, remembering the moment his sister fell into the wormhole. Guilt welled up in his eyes.\n\"Yeah, during a training competition on Hecaris, I was ambushed by insectoids and fell into a black hole. When I woke up, I was in the Empire,\" Arix recounted casually, as if it were someone else’s story, not wanting Scion and the others to worry.\nAlthough Scion hadn’t known Arix for long, he could tell that this little cub liked to hide her wounds, only showing her strength and bravery.\nHe didn’t call her out on it. Instead, he gently patted her head and asked, \"Were you scared?\"\n\"Of course I was scared. But sometimes, even if you’re scared, you still have to act. If I hadn’t tried to stop them, more people would have died,\" Arix said, remembering the innocent faces of her classmates. That event had nearly cost her life, but she had no regrets.\nIf she had stood by and done nothing, it would have haunted her forever, no matter how many times she tried to make up for it later. It wasn’t about being a saint; it was about a basic human principle.\n\"You’re still young, so you need to protect yourself better,\" Scion advised, not fully agreeing or disagreeing with her stance.\nArix nodded obediently. \"Okay.\"\n\"Good girl,\" Scion said softly, his eyes gentle.\nSensing the heavy mood in the room, Arix decided to change the subject. \"By the way, Scion, we have the bloodline test tomorrow. Do I need to prepare anything?\"\nDrexel, who had been looking rather down, also perked up at this question.\n\"No need. I’ll take you there at 8:45,\" Scion replied with a warm smile.\n\"Okay.\" Arix gave Scion an adorable howl before resuming her steak.\n\"And, um... I need a bloodline test tomorrow too,\" Drexel chimed in, realizing they had forgotten about him.\nArix paused her eating and then, as if just remembering, told Scion, \"Oh, right, Scion, my brother needs a bloodline test too.\"\n\"Him? A therian?\" Scion looked Drexel up and down, unable to see any therian traits. He assumed Drexel’s bloodline purity would be quite low. Uninterested, Scion gave a rare dismissive response, \"Okay.\"\n\"Thank you, Scion,\" Arix said politely.\nDrexel scratched his head awkwardly, \"Thanks, Scion... um, Scion bro.\"\nScion’s initially stern expression softened at the last three words, and he nodded kindly at Drexel.\nSeeing Scion’s attitude shift, Drexel finally understood why Scion had been giving him such a cold face since they met—he minded being treated like a senior, an elder.\nRealizing this, Drexel was both amused and exasperated.\n’Is it really okay for the Empire’s admiral to be concerned about such things?’",

      "content": "Chapter 123: Drexel’s Therian Form\nAfter dinner, the three of them went their separate ways.\nScion escorted Arix back to her bedroom before hurrying off to handle legion affairs.\nAfter watching him leave, Arix lounged leisurely on her bed, flipping through her mecha textbook while also watching a live stream about the Empire’s mechas.\n\"The mecha system includes inner and outer core systems, and ten peripheral systems. Combined, these are referred to as ’mecha’.\nThere were systems for energy transmission, for skeletal, for the plugin, for the life support system...\nAs the live stream detailed each part, Arix turned to the corresponding page in her textbook. The live commentary made the material much easier to grasp.\nBy the time the live stream was wrapping up, it was past 10 PM. Feeling sleepy, Arix yawned, sent ten virtual castle gifts to the streamer as usual, and exited the live stream.\nRemembering the bloodline test scheduled for early the next morning, Arix set her textbook aside, closed her eyes, and drifted off to sleep.\nTesting the bloodline is the most significant event for any clan in the Empire, so the chosen location is usually a special place for them.\nTake the Tiger clan, for instance; they conduct their bloodline tests in their clan’s Holy Temple.\nToday was their bloodline testing day. Many members of the Tiger clan have already gathered at the Holy Temple with their little ones.\nAside from a few locals, most have journeyed from other planets just for this occasion.\nSince it wasn’t 9 AM yet, the main gate of the Holy Temple remained closed. The group had to wait outside, killing time by chatting about the children in their arms.\nThey debated whose child seemed to have high bloodline purity and whose seemed lower.\nIn the midst of these discussions, Scion arrived carrying Arix. The two instantly drew everyone’s attention.\n\"Who is that child in Scion’s arms? Just one look and you can tell the bloodline is very pure,\" someone remarked.\n\"I don’t know, but seeing the golden mark on her forehead, her bloodline is certainly not low. The first Tiger Lord had a mark like that,\" another added.\n\"Now that you mention it, this little one does resemble the first Tiger Lord,\" someone else noted.\nArix, unable to understand their words, sensed they were probably praising her. Feeling pleased, she straightened up and put on a calm, aloof expression, trying her best to sit elegantly in Scion’s arms. After all, she couldn’t embarrass the admiral.\nUnbeknownst to Arix, her attempt at dignity only made her look more adorable. People found her not just beautiful but also incredibly cute.\nTrying to act aloof while sneaking glances at everyone, her contrast was too charming to resist.\nFriendly chuckles filled the air, and even Scion’s lips curved into a slight smile.\nOut of everyone, only Arix believed she looked cool. Drexel, standing behind Scion, silently facepalmed, thinking his sister’s intelligence had reverted along with her age.\nLuckily, their timing was spot on. As Scion reached the Holy Temple entrance, the clock struck 9 AM.\nThe main gate opened, and everyone’s focus shifted from teasing Arix to the temple.\nThe Holy Temple is an enormous hall, ending with a grand tiger statue that gazes down sternly at everyone gathered.\nRight before the statue stands a circular platform, half a meter high, placed in the center.\nA long carpet runs from this platform, descending three steps, and stretches all the way to the entrance.\nLamps line the walls, casting a soft, ever-burning glow.\nAs Arix looked closer, she saw the walls were densely inscribed with the names of Tiger clan members. Those names must belong to the ancestors of the Tiger clan, she thought, feeling a sense of awe.\n\"You’ll take the bloodline test on that platform,\" Scion said, holding Arix at the edge of the carpet and pointing to the platform.\nArix glanced over curiously; she had noticed it earlier but wondered what made it special.\n’Will the test be like in fantasies, where a device shows bloodline purity when touched? Or maybe a crystal ball that reveals purity with a drop of blood? Surely, it couldn’t be as simple as just standing there, right?’\nWhile Arix was still guessing, Krylak, the clan leader, entered with four elders.\nThey walked down the carpet to the platform and turned to face the gathered clan members.\nKrylak scanned the crowd before speaking, \"The bloodline purity test is about to begin. Place the untested cubs on the carpet in the center.\"\nFollowing the clan leader’s instructions, parents began to place their fluffy cubs on the central carpet in an orderly fashion. When all the little cubs were lined up adorably, only Drexel remained standing, looking mortified and refusing to move.\nArix, noticing Drexel’s absence, turned to look for him and quickly spotted him trying to hide behind Scion.\n\"Pfft,\" Arix couldn’t help but giggle.\nLooking at the fluffy cubs in front and behind her, she understood Drexel’s reluctance—he was the only big ’cub’ among them.\nBut as a caring sister, she couldn’t leave him behind.\nWithout hesitation, Arix flew out of the line, flapping her wings, and grabbed Drexel’s sleeve, dragging him to the end of the line of fluffy cubs.\nAt first, the clan members were puzzled, wondering what this little cub was up to. When they saw Arix dragging Drexel to the end of the fluffy line, they finally understood what was going on.\nThe hall was filled with amused chuckles, making even the sternest elders crack a smile. Arix’s antics, paired with Drexel’s sheepish compliance, brought a light-hearted moment to the serious occasion.\n\"Mom, look, there’s a big cub!\" a one-year-old exclaimed in a cute, surprised voice, pointing at Drexel. He had already been tested for bloodline purity last year.\n\"Ahem, sweetie, he is just testing his bloodline a bit later than usual. We shouldn’t laugh at him,\" said a Tiger clan mom who had been chuckling earlier. She smiled apologetically at Drexel and gently explained to her little one.\n\"Oh, then he is late, huh? Did he not listen to his mom?\" The little cub assumed Drexel was disobedient and immediately looked at him with disdain.\n\"Ahem.\" The mom glanced awkwardly at Drexel. Then she quickly covered her little cub’s mouth and retreated to the back of the crowd, feeling embarrassed.\nDrexel was left speechless.\n’No matter what I’ve done before, I deserved more than being mocked by a one-year-old.’\nHaving given up arguing with the kid completely, Drexel stood stiffly at the back of the fluffy line. Only his body was standing there; his soul had already left, mortified beyond words.",

      "content": "Chapter 124: The Test\nWatching the embarrassed Drexel, Arix chuckled softly.\nArix nodded in approval, then turned back to the platform ahead.\nThe test had begun. The first little cub slowly made its way to the center of the platform and stood there, waiting quietly.\nEveryone’s eyes were on the cub, as if expecting something. Their faces were even more nervous than the cub’s.\nA mysterious energy surrounded the little cub. Then, in a flash, a tiny wound appeared on her forehead.\nA single drop of blood emerged from the cub’s forehead.\nThe blood floated over to the forehead of the tiger statue and merged into it like a drop of water into the sea.\nSoon, an emblem glowing with red light appeared on the tiger statue’s forehead.\nArix hadn’t quite figured out what the red emblem meant when the Holy Temple was filled with sighs.\n’Does this mean her talent is poor?’\nArix wondered, frowning in thought.\n\"Krylak, Level 1 blood purity, next,\" Krylak announced with a sigh.\nThe cub’s parents were heartbroken, but they tearfully carried the oblivious cub off the platform.\n\"Garrick, Level 2 blood purity.\"\n\"Zara, Level 3 blood purity.\"\n\"Donovan, Level 6 blood purity.\"\nThe next cubs showed decent talents, especially Donovan, who caused quite a stir among the Tiger clan.\nAnother genius was born.\nLevel 4 blood purity meant that after transformation, his psychic and physical powers would be Supergiant-Class.\nDonovan’s parents were so thrilled they nearly fainted.\nOriginally from a side branch of the Tiger clan, they weren’t even allowed to live on the home planet.\nBut because of Donovan’s talent, they could now move to the main family’s place.\nThis was a huge honor for any side branch member of the Tiger clan.\nAs the number of cubs waiting for the test dwindled, Arix started to understand the test.\nFrom level one to seven—with seven being the highest blood purity level, and one the lowest.\nAfter a while, only Drexel and Arix were left.\nDrexel turned to his sister and asked, \"Arix, do you want to go first?\"\nArix shook her head. It didn’t matter who went first.\nSeeing his sister shake her head, Drexel didn’t hesitate. He walked straight to the center of the platform, mimicking the cubs by standing still and waiting quietly.\nThe Tiger clan members were quite curious about Drexel, the big cub. As soon as he stepped onto the platform, he immediately drew everyone’s attention, sparking a wave of discussion.\nThe process was the same as before. First, a mysterious energy surrounded Drexel. Then, a tiny pinhole appeared on his forehead.\nA drop of blood emerged from the tiny wound, quickly condensing in mid-air and floating at the center of his forehead.\nThe blood droplet then flew to the forehead of the tiger statue and merged into it.\nSoon, the emblem on the tiger statue’s forehead glowed red.\nThis red light, indicating the lowest blood purity, instantly caused a stir among the Tiger clan members.\n\"Oh my god, that can’t be right. His beast form transformation is so perfect; how can he have the lowest blood purity?\"\n\"Could it be a mistake?\"\n\"Impossible, the statue has never been wrong!\"\nHearing the discussions of the Tiger clan, Arix frowned, also finding it hard to believe.\nIt wasn’t that she had too much confidence in her brother; Drexel was indeed very strong.\nBoth his physical and psychic powers were naturally Supergiant-Class. It was impossible that his bloodline purity would be so low.\n’Is it that the human bloodline within Drexel was overpowering the therian bloodline?’\nJust as Arix thought she had guessed correctly, the emblem on the tiger statue’s forehead changed again.\n\"Blue light, that’s level four!\" someone yelled out.\nNot only Arix but the entire Tiger clan was dumbfounded. \"What is happening?\"\nThe Holy Temple fell silent.\nEveryone was just about to accept that the tiger statue might indeed have malfunctioned, but then, it lit up red again.\nTiger clan members and Arix stared in shock. \"Wow, this is really confusing.\"\nThe tiger statue’s forehead kept alternating between red and blue.\nIt was like a disco light, and Arix almost thought it was a dance party.\nFortunately, after a while, the light on the tiger statue’s forehead finally stopped, and everyone’s hearts, which had been thumping wildly, also calmed down.\nBut the test result was rather hard to describe.\nThe light on the tiger statue’s forehead was half vivid red and half deep blue.\nHeh...\nThis awkward color combination left everyone speechless.\nThe atmosphere in the Holy Temple became silent, and everyone stood there, dumbfounded, looking at each other.\nFinally, Krylak, the clan leader, broke the silence and said, \"There’s nothing strange about this. We have records about it. For instance, if one’s mother is from our Tiger clan and the father is from another powerful race, their offspring might inherit talents from both parents. That’s why the test showed two results.\"\n\"Does this mean his blood purity is low or high?\" one of the Tiger clan members asked from below the platform.\n\"I can only say it’s not bad. As for what the future holds, no one knows for sure,\" Krylak replied, leaving it at that without elaborating further.\nAfter speaking, he turned to Drexel and asked kindly, \"Drexel, right?\"\nDrexel nodded obediently and politely called out, \"Yes, sir.\"\nKrylak squinted his eyes and smiled warmly, \"Good boy, Drexel. Make sure to attend the blessing ceremony next month. As for your blood purity, whether it turns out to be the lowest or the highest is something only your future self can determine.\"\nDrexel was even more confused. He felt that Krylak’s words were as ambiguous as the results from the tiger statue. It was like they were both glowing and not glowing, both saying something and saying nothing at all.\nIt was like Schrödinger’s cat, leaving him utterly puzzled and without any clear answers.\nIt was simply maddening.\nKrylak knew Drexel must be brimming with questions. Instead, he just smiled and read out the results with little fuss.",

      "content": "Chapter 125: The Test (2)\n\"Drexel, bloodline purity undetermined. Next.\"\nDrexel stared at him, mouth agape. He took a deep breath, barely containing his frustration, and walked off the platform.\nHe looked quite upset. Then he saw Arix stepping up for her bloodline test. Letting go of his irritation, he smiled. He clenched his fist, and gave Arix an encouraging gesture.\nArix smiled back at Drexel. She then refocused, feeling both excited and nervous, and stepped to the center of the platform.\nAs Arix stood there, energy began to flow from the forehead of the tiger statue, swirling around her. This energy seemed particularly pleased with Arix, circling her more times than it had for any of the other cubs before.\nThe crowd watched in amazement.\n\"It’s the first time I’ve seen the statue so fond of a cub. It’s already gone around six times! Even Donovan only got three.\"\n\"Do you think this unusual behavior means this cub could have a level seven bloodline purity?\"\n\"Dream on! Our clan hasn’t had a level-seven Celesterror Lord for generations. I’d be satisfied with a level six purity today.\"\n\"Yeah, that’s true.\"\nArix also sensed the energy. Strangely, it felt very familiar to her. It reminded her of Vita, Cupid, and even Sophia.\nArix’s bright blue eyes widened in shock and uncertainty as she looked at the statue. The energy felt exactly like the fused psychic power of Vita and the others!\nWhen she had planned to assassinate Quispe, she had made the trio manifest a scalpel, and this energy felt exactly the same.\nJust as Arix was about to ask Vita and the others, something unexpected happened. The energy aimed at her forehead, likely to make a tiny pinprick to extract a drop of blood.\nBut Cupid didn’t know that. In her psychic world, Cupid, who had been asleep, was jolted awake just before the energy touched Arix’s forehead.\nMistaking the approaching energy for an attack, Cupid got furious and, with overwhelming power, swallowed the energy in one gulp.\nYes, he swallowed it.\nThe sudden disappearance of the energy left the Holy Temple in dead silence. The Tiger clan members were clueless about what had just happened. They only knew that the statue’s energy had abruptly vanished.\nThe crowd watched the statue’s energy abruptly vanish, then exchanged puzzled glances before looking up at the tiger statue again. The ancestral figure seemed unusually lively today, having teased them twice already. Earlier, despite being a dual-color bloodline purity test, the statue had at least given a result. But now, it had skipped even the step of drawing a drop of forehead blood.\nNo one suspected Arix since she was just a little cub. They all thought the statue was playing tricks on them again.\nBut Arix knew exactly what had happened.\nSuppressing a scream that almost escaped her throat, she hurriedly communicated with Cupid in her mind, \"Cupid, you can’t eat it! Spit it out, quick!\"\nCupid blinked in confusion but obediently expelled the energy.\nSeeing the visibly smaller energy orb, Arix sighed in relief. Smaller or not, at least it was still there.\nOnce she felt reassured, Arix explained to Cupid, \"It’s okay. It’s not an enemy. Let it poke you.\"\n\"Got it,\" Cupid replied cheerfully.\nFortunately, the energy lacked consciousness. After being spat out, it hesitated for only a few seconds before continuing with the task of drawing Arix’s forehead blood.\nOnce it had the drop of blood, the energy returned to the statue’s forehead.\nSeeing the energy safely return, Arix finally felt completely at ease.\nToday’s test had been quite the rollercoaster—first Drexel’s antics, then her almost making the statue’s energy disappear.\nArix nervously touched her nose, thinking that the statue must feel quite unlucky to deal with siblings like them.\nIt was a good thing the energy had no consciousness; otherwise, the Holy Temple might soon post a sign banning Arix, Drexel, and any other troublemakers from entering.\nAmused by her own thoughts, Arix suppressed her laughter and asked internally, \"Sophia, Vita, Cupid, was it just my imagination? That energy seemed exactly like ours.\"\nBefore Vita or Sophia could respond, Cupid smacked his lips and said, \"When I swallowed that energy, it did feel like I was eating a part of myself. So it was the same.\"\nArix curled her lips.\n’Cupid, you’ve really exposed us here, you know that?’\nFeeling exasperated, Arix realized she’d better get more Insectoid Cores to keep the gluttonous Cupid from trying to eat everything, including himself.\nVita chuckled and ruffled Cupid’s hair, while Sophia gave Cupid a speechless glance before answering Arix’s question.\n\"That energy should be the residual psychic power of the original clan leader. You’re his descendant, so it’s not surprising that it’s similar,\" Sophia explained, as if stating a simple fact like 1+1=2.\nBut Arix shivered at what she heard.\n’Residual psychic power from the first clan leader? Does that mean the temple is haunted?’\nNoticing Arix’s thoughts, Sophia rolled her eyes and said, \"It’s just pure psychic power, no soul, and it’s definitely not a haunting. The first Tiger lord must have poured all his psychic power into this statue before dying. Every year, descendants offer a drop of their blood for testing, and the pure psychic power in that blood keeps the statue energized.\"\nHearing such a logical explanation, Arix sighed in relief. Then she remembered she had also offered a drop of her blood and frowned with concern. \"Does the offering have any effects?\" she asked worriedly.\nThinking about offerings, Arix’s mind wandered to all sorts of sacrificial practices throughout history, from ancient human sacrifices that left the victim intact to those that didn’t even leave ashes. The more she thought about it, the more terrified she became, her face turning pale.\n\"None at all,\" Sophia replied flatly. \"Drinking a cup of milk should replenish you.\"\nArix was surprised, and she fell in silence.\nIf something as simple as drinking milk could make up for it, there was no need to make it sound so terrifying.",

      "content": "Chapter 126: Test Over\nArix held back the urge to leave. She said, \"Alright, I got it.\" With that, Arix stopped talking to Cupid and the others, focusing on the statue.\n’So, what level will my bloodline purity be?’\nAs everyone waited eagerly, the emblem on the statue finally lit up. The bright red light made Arix so disappointed.\n’Level one? Seriously?’\nSeeing the red emblem, Arix wondered if maybe her human bloodline was suppressing her therian bloodline. With her Supergiant+ psychic power, it should be at least level six, well, or at least she thought so.\nThe Tiger clan members below the platform started murmuring. They didn’t believe that Admiral Scion’s favorite little cub was only a level-one. Thinking about the statue and the dual-colored situation earlier, everyone waited patiently again.\nIn Arix’s psychic world, the three little ones also looked suspiciously at the statue.\n\"Arix can’t possibly have just level one bloodline purity,\" Vita objected first.\n\"At least level six,\" Sophia nodded in agreement.\n\"Arix, maybe I should just swallow it,\" Cupid said, glaring at the statue with a pair of threatening little tiger fangs.\n’Could it be that its energy was eaten up by Cupid earlier, so it’s not working right?’\nArix thought, recalling how the already faint energy had been drained further by Cupid.\nHearing what was going on in Arix’s mind, Cupid suddenly felt his little fangs get a bit cold. He blinked, and quickly retracted them, feeling a bit guilty.\nVita and Sophia also thought it made sense. After exchanging a glance, Vita suggested, \"Let’s wait and see.\"\nAll three nodded simultaneously, thinking the idea was feasible, and once again looked at the statue’s forehead.\nSure enough, after a while, the red light of the totem gradually faded, replaced by an orange light. Seeing the orange light, everyone in the Holy Temple breathed a sigh of relief and started discussing again.\n\"See, how could the admiral’s cub only have level one bloodline purity?\"\n\"Even level two is still too low for her. Will it change to level three next?\"\n\"It’s possible.\"\nThe Tiger clan’s leader, Krylak, stared at the statue’s forehead, dumbfounded. \"What’s this?\" Krylak looked at the now yellow totem. Then, he turned to the four elders beside him in confusion.\nThe four elders exchanged glances and shook their heads simultaneously.\n\"It’s not in the clan’s records,\" the first elder, Faelan, stroked his long beard and shook his head.\n\"Never heard of it, never seen it,\" said the second elder, Rowtag, as he adjusted his old-fashioned glasses.\n\"Let’s wait and see,\" the third elder, Bran, suggested with a smile.\n\"Agreed,\" the fourth elder, Kylian, nodded indifferently.\nSeeing the four elders speak, Krylak had to suppress his confusion and focus on the tiger statue again. Deep down, he was filled with anticipation.\n’Will Arix really have level-six bloodline purity?’\nAs everyone eagerly watched, the emblem’s color continued to change until it finally turned blue, signaling level six. The crowd erupted in cheers.\n\"Oh wow, another level-six genius!\"\n\"This year, our Tiger clan has measured two with level-six bloodline purities, plus the... the half one from earlier, making it two and a half. Can any other clan in the Empire compete with us?\"\n\"Ha, I knew it! How could the admiral’s favorite cub be ordinary?\"\nOnce the color turned blue, everyone in the Tiger clan instinctively felt it wouldn’t change again.\nDuring the long wait, the crowd, including those from other planets, learned that Arix and Drexel were from the Alliance. The fact that the siblings, who weren’t even from the Empire, had Tiger clan blood was already astonishing enough.\nKrylak and the elders exchanged satisfied smiles. As everyone assumed the bloodline test was over, Krylak prepared to announce Arix’s test results.\n\"Arix, your bloodline purity level is...\" Krylak was halfway through his announcement when the blue light on the emblem suddenly turned into a dazzling purple.\nKrylak’s words got stuck in his throat, and his eyes almost bulged out in shock. The rest of the Tiger clan stared at the statue, stunned like ducks being strangled.\nThe emblem’s light had turned purple, meaning Arix’s a level seven!\nEveryone in the Holy Temple rubbed their eyes in unison, carefully observing the emblem for a moment.\nOnce they were sure they weren’t mistaken, their first reaction wasn’t joy or laughter. Instead, they began to weep.\n\"It’s been a hundred years. Our clan finally has a pureblood cub. She’s going to be a Celesterror Queen.\"\n\"Finally, we won’t be looked down upon by those jerks anymore.\"\n\"Yes! Let’s see those jerks try to show off in front of us now. They’ve devolved from dragons to almost snakes and lizards, and they still have the audacity to call themselves the Dragons. Even their pureblood is just a hydra.\"\nThe Tiger clan members, recalling the discrimination they had faced over the years, held each other and cried.\nTherian clans in the Empire competed with each other on almost all occasions. For any clan, if they don’t have a pureblood among their cubs, they would be despised. Although the Tiger clan is one of the major families in the Empire, they were no exception of that.\nThe Tiger clan had gone a whole century without a pureblood, and the bitterness they endured was beyond words.\nArix was just as surprised as everyone else that her bloodline purity level turned out to be seven.\n\"Sophia, did the statue make a mistake? How can I have level seven bloodline purity?\" Arix asked, holding her chin with her paws, equally stunned.\nShe thought she was from the Alliance, so how could she become a pureblood therian? \"Does this mean I’m no longer human?\"\n\"Although it’s unexpected, the fact is right in front of us. From now on, you’re not a human anymore,\" Sophia said with a smirk, clearly enjoying Arix’s confusion.\nHearing that, Arix had mixed feelings.\n’If I go back to the Alliance now, will I live in a house or a zoo? But, I mean... Tigers are a protected species, right? I’ll be living a very comfortable life in the zoo, without having to work.’\nCome to think of it, being a tiger seemed better than being a human.\nWhile Arix was lost in thought, Krylak, having snapped out of his shock, excitedly lifted her up.\nHe announced to the Tiger clan below, \"Arix, with level-seven bloodline purity, is our generation’s pureblood cub!\"\n\"Whoa!\"\n\"Awesome!\"\n\"Awoooo!\"\nThe tigermen below the platform erupted in joy, some even transforming into their beast forms and roaring happily at the sky.\nHeld aloft by Krylak, Arix stared at the excited crowd, blinking as she thought.\n’Maybe staying a tiger wouldn’t be so bad after all...’",

      "content": "Chapter 127: The Libertines\nToday, word spread like wildfire across the Empire about the birth of a pureblood cub to the Tiger clan. The news had everyone buzzing.\nEvery therian in the Empire was talking about the new Tiger cub.\nThe sneaky dragons made snarky comments but kept their distance from the mighty Tigers, only grumbling amongst themselves.\nThe strong, straightforward mermen sent gifts to celebrate.\nThe easygoing birdmen didn’t think much of another pureblood arrival but enjoyed a few extra bug legs in honor of the event.\nThe elves, close allies of the Tigers, sent their prized honey as soon as they heard the news.\nWhen Alpha Leonidas and Luna Amethyst learned the pureblood cub was named Arix, they were both amazed and pleased for Cassian’s good luck.\nIn the Empire, the four pureblood cubs were second only to the royal family in esteem. If Cassian and Arix were to fall for each other, no one would dare oppose their match.\nTo give their son a chance, Leonidas and Amethyst sent Cassian to the Tiger clan to congratulate them.\nThey brought a mountain of gifts, but the most significant was Alpha Leonidas’ promise of a wish. Arix could use this wish to claim a ducal rank in the Empire if she wanted.\nWhat would Arix choose? No one knew yet.\nThe Dragon clan, the Merman clan, the Birdman clan, and the Elves all sent representatives with gifts too. The Tiger clan was more festive than it had ever been.\nWhile they celebrated, things were tense in the Dragon clan’s territory...\nDragon clan leader Ignathor was furious, smashing a teacup to the floor. \"An elder was killed on his own land, and after a whole day, you haven’t caught the culprit? What are you good for? How did our clan end up with such useless members?\"\nIgnathor fumed, glaring at the ten elite members of the clan’s agents kneeling before him.\nThe leader of the agents spoke with a mix of respect and coldness, \"We haven’t caught them, but we know who did it.\"\n\"Who is it?\" Ignathor’s eyes blazed with rage. Whoever it was, he would make him pay dearly.\n\"It was the Empire’s top bounty target, the Libertines!\" The agent trembled slightly as he said the name.\nEven the leader’s reaction showed just how terrifying these space pirates were.\nThe Libertines, a space pirate group that emerged out of nowhere ten years ago, had a mysterious origin and an unknown base of operations.\nAfter their sudden appearance, they quickly established themselves as the strongest space pirates in the Empire, defeating every rival in their path.\nWhat made the Libertines unique was that they didn’t follow the usual pirate path of bullying the weak or robbing commercial spacecraft. Instead, they exclusively targeted various corrupt forces within the galaxy, amassing their wealth by preying on other criminals.\nTheir most famous act was successfully dismantling the Empire’s most notorious human trafficking clan.\nBy removing this blight from the Empire, the Libertines earned a reputation as heroes among many common therian citizens. Even the Empire’s royal family turned a blind eye to their activities afterward.\nThis made the Libertines a source of admiration for many cadets in the Empire’s military academies, with some eager to join their ranks.\nUnfortunately, the Libertines remained too secretive, and no one had ever been known to successfully join them. Even clans hoping to plant spies had given up.\nWhen Ignathor heard it was the Libertines, his anger subsided, and his eyes twitched.\nHe knew well enough to weigh the consequences of provoking the Libertines.\nAfter considering his options, Ignathor rubbed his forehead and asked, \"Do we know the reason?\"\n\"Not clearly, but there was a message left at the scene. It said the ninth elder messed with someone he shouldn’t have...\" The leader of the dark unit spoke hesitantly.\nIgnathor closed his eyes. He took a deep breath to quell his anger, and then opened his eyes. \"This matter ends here. We’ll tell the public that the ninth elder died of a sudden illness.\"\n\"Understood.\" The leader of the dark unit placed his right hand on his chest in a respectful salute, then he led the other elite agents out of the room.\nOnce alone, Ignathor frowned deeply and muttered, \"The ninth elder is dead, and the Tiger clan has a new pureblood cub. Nothing good for us has happened lately...\"\nOn the same day, there was good news on the interstellar net of the Alliance.\nThe Alliance’s official headline announced the latest news about Arix: the recipient of the Alliance’s highest honor had been rescued a few days ago and was currently recovering. In about a month, Arix would return to Hecaris Military Academy to pick up her studies.\nThis news caused an immediate uproar both online and offline throughout the Alliance.\nPeople flooded the interstellarnet, sending their well-wishes to Arix. Some beneficiaries of Psychic Healers also posted their thanks under the Alliance’s official announcement.\nStudents at the Hecaris Military Academy were the happiest of all. Almost everyone there was genuinely overjoyed, as the grief that had been hanging over the academy finally dissipated completely today.\nArix’s friends were especially thrilled, spreading the news to each other excitedly.\nAt the Koros Military Academy, Zephyr heard the news and continued calmly cleaning his energy gun. However, the slight smile on his lips betrayed his good mood.\nAt the Snorri Military Academy, Elio, who had been training relentlessly since Arix fell into the black hole, collapsed onto the training ground floor upon hearing that Arix was alive. He kept repeating, \"Great, thank god,\" over and over.\nAt the Ceres Military Academy, Varden pushed up his glasses, his voice filled with deep longing as he said, \"Arix, when will you come back to help me learn potion making?\" He sighed and went back to laboring over the mountain of medical ingredients his troublesome grandfather had sent.\nAt the Mulado Military Academy, Cirilla was sparring with her brother when she heard the news and burst into tears.\nAmid her sobs, she murmured through her congested nose, \"Welcome back, Arix.\"\nOnly then did she notice Adrian staring at her in shock. Her fingers twitched, realizing he was still there.\nWiping her tears, she quickly replaced her expression with a cold, menacing look. Her lips curled into a threatening smile as she asked, \"You didn’t see anything, right, Adrian?\"\nAdrian swallowed hard and shook his head frantically. \"N-no, I didn’t see anything!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 128: Arix’s Wish\nArix sat at the table in a small yard, looking absolutely stunned. Her eyes were wide as she stared at Cassian. \"Are you serious? Your father really promised to grant me a wish?\"\n\"Yep,\" Cassian confirmed with a nod. Then, with a slight frown, he added, \"My dad is so tight-fisted, though—just one wish. If it were up to me, I’d give you three, Arix.\"\nArix felt a bit awkward. She scratched her head and chuckled, \"One is plenty. More than enough, really.\"\nSince finding out Cassian was the crown prince, Drexel had been sitting in a chair, deep in thought. But hearing Arix, he snapped back to reality and looked at her with keen interest. \"Arix, you actually have a wish?\"\n\"Yeah, and it’s a really good one,\" Arix said, her eyes softening as she thought about her time with Mama Tiger. Just the memory made her feel warm inside.\n\"What is it? Do you want the Alliance and the Empire to never go to war again?\" Drexel suggested. He thought that would be the best wish. If they avoided war, aside from dealing with the insectoids, the universe would be a much more peaceful place.\n\"That’s unnecessary. As long as I’m around, the Empire won’t start a war with the Alliance,\" Cassian stated confidently, his voice carrying the weight of his future role. He then looked at Arix kindly, \"Arix, ask for something you really want.\"\nDrexel threw a disdainful glance at the overly affectionate Cassian but stayed quiet, considering his earlier statement.\n\"Thanks, Cassian,\" Arix said, feeling a bit more at ease. His words had reassured her.\nCassian smiled at her, nodding encouragingly.\n\"My wish is for the Empire’s Celesterrors to be under the same special protection regulations as the Alliance’s,\" Arix said, her claws nervously gripping the table.\nBoth Drexel and Cassian were shocked. They couldn’t understand why Arix would wish for that.\nDrexel felt a pang of disappointment. \"Arix, if you don’t have a wish, you could give the chance to me. I could use a Supergiant-Class mecha.\"\n\"Arix, your brother’s right. A Supergiant-Class mecha would be great too,\" Cassian chimed in. He thought this wish was a waste for Arix, offering no personal gain. Even though it was his father who had to fulfill the wish, Cassian wanted Arix to get the most out of it and not hold back.\nArix gave an exasperated look at her brother before shaking her head at Cassian. \"No, my wish is exactly this.\"\n\"Arix, can I ask why?\" Cassian didn’t push further, figuring he could always ask his father for something good for her later.\nArix smiled, lost in thought for a moment. \"When I first came to the Empire, a Celesterror tiger helped me out. I want to repay that kindness.\"\nHearing this, Drexel and Cassian understood there was no changing her mind. Gratitude and repaying kindness were core to who Arix was. Asking her to be ungrateful would be tougher than defeating Quispe—at least that had some hope.\nDrexel sighed deeply, choosing not to argue. Cassian, already scheming a backup plan, smiled and gently patted Arix’s fluffy head. \"Alright, I respect your decision.\"\n\"Thanks,\" Arix nodded, returning his smile.\nDrexel watched Cassian’s hand on Arix’s head with obvious displeasure, his intense gaze practically burning a hole through it. Cassian noticed Drexel’s murderous glare and, out of respect for Arix, reluctantly withdrew his hand.\nSatisfied, Drexel smirked and sat back down, relishing his role as the universe’s biggest third wheel.\n’I’m a third wheel, and I’m proud of it!’\nCassian was clearly annoyed. If it weren’t for Arix, he wouldn’t spend a second with Drexel.\n’I need to come up with something,’\nhe thought. Finally seeing Arix again, he couldn’t let this nuisance hang around.\nCassian’s lips curled into a sly smile as he recalled some information from his investigations. He had an idea.\n\"Hey, Drexel,\" Cassian said, sounding unusually friendly, \"I remember you like playing holographic mecha battles on the interstellarnet, right?\"\n\"So what?\" Drexel shot Cassian a disdainful look, lifting one eyelid.\n’This guy is up to something again. You think I don’t know? Hmph, let’s see what you’ve got.’\nCassian, more confident now, pulled out a top-tier Connective Pod, a rare model gifted to the royal family. Casually, he said, \"I have a top-of-the-line series Connective Pod. Interested?\"\nDrexel, who had been lounging with his legs crossed, opened one eye slightly at first.\nWhen he saw it was the limited-edition Connective Pod he had only dreamed of, his eyes widened. As he stared at it, he could barely hold back his excitement.\nThis was the one he had only ever seen from a distance, never having the chance to touch.\n\"...Um, yes, I’m interested.\" Drexel’s eyes were glued to the irresistible dream machine. He couldn’t say no.\n\"Then it’s yours to play with,\" Cassian said generously, a broad smile spreading across his face.\nDrexel swallowed hard, pointing incredulously at the Connective Pod. \"Are you serious? You’re giving it to me?\"\nCassian nodded, still smiling.\nDrexel took a deep breath. His opinion of Cassian changed in an instant.\n’This isn’t some scheming brat; this is a genuinely generous guy!’\n\"Want to try it out? If anything’s wrong, I can get you another one,\" Cassian encouraged, his enthusiasm evident.\n\"Okay, okay, I’m heading out. You two have a good chat, take your time. Bye!\" Drexel swiftly packed up the Connective Pod and vanished in an instant, completely forgetting about his sister.\nCassian watched Drexel disappear and couldn’t help but chuckle.\n’Well, that’s one way to get rid of a third wheel,’\nhe thought to himself.\nTurning back to Arix, he felt a wave of relief. Finally, some alone time.\n\"So, Arix, now that it’s just us, how have you been?\" he asked warmly, genuinely curious about her well-being.\nArix watched silently as Cassian performed. She waited until Drexel finally left before bursting into laughter.\n\"Don’t you feel bad? You just gave away a Connective Pod worth millions,\" Arix said, amused.\nArix knew Cassian had sent Drexel away just because he found him annoying. But giving away such a pricey gadget seemed extreme.\n\"If you like it, I can give you one too. Oh, and I brought that car you mentioned earlier,\" Cassian said, first pulling out a Connective Pod and then rummaging in his Space Button for the car.\n\"What car?\" Arix was confused, not having had the chance to refuse before Cassian’s last comment threw her off.\n\"The car I promised to give you when we were on our way to the auction,\" Cassian replied. He soon revealed an shining Lev, crafted from a Supergiant-Class insectoid shell.\nSeeing the high-end Lev, Arix finally remembered. Her fingers trembled as she pointed at the Lev, asking, \"Is this really the car made from a Supergiant-Class insectoid shell?\"\n\"Yes, do you like it? It’s yours,\" Cassian said warmly, without a hint of hesitation.\nArix gasped, shaking her head quickly. \"No way, it’s too expensive. I can’t accept it.\"\nThe car was worth more than she could ever dream of affording.\n\"But Arix, you already said you’d take it,\" Cassian said, feigning a hurt expression.\n\"I said that because I didn’t think you actually had it,\" Arix replied, still stunned that Cassian was the heir to the Empire.\n\"So, can you accept it?\" Cassian asked, looking at her with his captivating golden eyes, as if her refusal would break his heart.\nArix was speechless.\nAfter a long pause, Arix sighed, taking out ten psychic power healing potions she had prepared for Cassian. \"Arix, what’s this?\" Cassian asked, puzzled.\n\"These are Supergiant-Class psychic power healing potions. They’re not a perfect match for your Supergiant+ level, but they’re the best I can make right now. They should be enough to save your life. Since you’ve given me such precious gifts, you have to accept my little token of appreciation,\" Arix said seriously.\nThese ten potions had cost Arix all her savings. She had made them out of concern for Cassian, worried that she might not be around to help him in a month’s time when she returned to the Alliance. This way, she could leave knowing he would be okay.\nCassian didn’t know the depth of Arix’s feelings behind this gesture. Seeing her determined face, he smiled slightly and said, \"Alright, thank you, Arix.\"\nWatching Cassian accept the gift without hesitation, Arix finally smiled with satisfaction and then stored away the Connective Pod and the car.",

      "content": "Chapter 129: A Historical Meeting\nAfter exchanging gifts, Cassian noticed it was getting late and finally addressed the second reason for his visit. \"Arix, do you know what being pureblood means?\" His face suddenly turned serious.\n\"I’m not sure, but it seems to come with a high status,\" Arix replied. Ever since she was discovered to be a pureblood cub, nearly everyone in the Tiger clan had looked at her with respect and trust.\nCassian nodded. \"In the Empire, pureblood cubs do have high status, but it also comes with risks. If someone wants to harm the Tiger clan, their first target would be you.\"\n\"Me again?\" Arix wasn’t surprised by Cassian’s words and seemed quite used to it.\n\"Others have targeted you too?\" Cassian’s eyebrows knitted together, a hidden fury in his eyes.\n\"Not people, but insectoids. You probably know this, Cassian. I have Supergiant+ psychic power, so I’m particularly attractive to insectoids. There have already been several attempts on my life by them,\" Arix said with a nonchalant smile.\n\"When I get stronger, the first thing I’ll do is wipe them out,\" Cassian said, even more angered by the fact that Arix was also targeted by insectoids.\n\"Don’t worry, Cassian, I can protect myself,\" Arix quickly reassured him, seeing how furious he was getting.\nDespite her confidence, Cassian still wasn’t convinced. He took off a sapphire necklace from around his neck and placed it in front of Arix. \"Arix, drop your blood on this,\" he said seriously.\n\"What is this? Are you trying to give me another precious thing?\" Arix frowned, resisting.\nGiven that it was a personal accessory, it was clearly something special. While she was touched by Cassian’s willingness to give her all his best things, she didn’t want him doing something foolish for her sake.\n\"Relax, it’s not that valuable. It’s just a locator. If you’re ever in danger, I can find you with it,\" Cassian explained with a mixture of helplessness and affection.\nArix still didn’t fully trust him, feeling like Cassian was trying to pull one over on her. But before she could refuse again, Cassian used his psychic power to cut her finger.\nA drop of blood fell onto the sapphire, which glowed faintly as it absorbed the blood, then returned to its original state.\n\"How could you...\" Arix was furious. She pointed at Cassian for a long time but unable to scold him, so she turned away in frustration.\n\"Arix, don’t be mad. This way, I’ll feel more at ease,\" Cassian said, gently touching her paw with his fingers, trying to appease her.\nArix didn’t know what to say.\nArix found it impossible to stay mad at Cassian for long. Her frustration dissipated in less than three seconds before she turned to him and asked, \"So what exactly is this necklace? Can you tell me now?\"\n\"It’s called the Moon’s Blessing,\" Cassian replied, his tone casual, as if he were giving away something as ordinary as an apple.\nArix frowned deeply. Although she didn’t know what the Moon’s Blessing was, the name alone suggested it was something extraordinary, not just a simple trinket.\nDetermined, she pushed the necklace back towards Cassian and looked him straight in the eye. \"I don’t want it. Take it back.\"\nCassian, however, shook his head with a smug yet playful expression. \"I can’t. It’s already bound to you by blood. From now on, you’re its only owner.\"\n\"You...\" Arix lifted her paw, pointing at Cassian, about to protest further.\nBut Cassian gently picked up the necklace and placed it around her neck, his voice soft and tender. \"Arix, I can’t always be with you. Let this necklace guard you for me instead.\"\nArix’s was touched. She looked down at the sapphire necklace that stood out so brilliantly against her white fur. This gift was too sweet for her to refuse.\nBecause Arix was a pureblood cub, the two most powerful interstellar nations, the Empire and the Alliance, convened a special international meeting.\nRepresenting the Empire were Alpha Leonidas, Luna Amethyst, the Tiger clan leader, and four clan elders. The Alliance was represented by President Zeta, Kering family head Matis, the couple Thaddeus and Fleur, and three Kering family elders.\nThe meeting kicked off with the Empire presenting a document to the Alliance. It revealed that Arix had been tested on an opticomputer and confirmed to have a level seven blood purity.\nThe Alliance members reviewed the data and exchanged meaningful glances, acknowledging that Arix was indeed a rare gem who would excel anywhere.\nPresident Zeta felt the weight of the situation the most. After closing the opticomputer file on the holographic screen, he faced the Empire representatives displayed on another screen.\n\"I’m sorry, but I can’t agree to your request,\" Zeta stated firmly, leaving no room for debate.\nThe Empire wanted Arix to stay in the Tiger clan as their holy child, symbolizing pureblood status within the clan, second only to the clan leader.\nIn return, they offered ten Supergiant-Class mechas and the Aqualis Region, which included 56 planets: ten rich in resources, twelve habitable, and thirty-four undeveloped. The offer was undeniably generous.\nHad the request involved someone else, like even his own son Elio, Zeta might have agreed without hesitation. But Arix, who invented the psychic power healing potion and was the Alliance’s sole Supergiant+ psychic power individual, was a different story.\nZeta’s refusal came naturally, driven by his deep commitment to the Alliance, even though it pained him.\nArix was the Alliance’s future hope. While the Empire’s offer was tempting, nurturing their own talent promised a more prosperous future for the Alliance. Properly cared for, Arix could bring unparalleled benefits, far surpassing the Empire’s proposal.\nThus, the Empire’s request had to be declined. Despite the heartache of turning down such an appealing offer, Zeta’s face remained steadfast, showing no signs of compromise.\nThe Empire was taken aback by the Alliance’s rejection. Krylak, not willing to give up, turned to Matis and asked, \"Does Admiral Kering agree with the President?\"\nMatis nodded firmly, without hesitation.\nMatis thought Krylak’s question was absurd. There was no way he’d trade his precious granddaughter, not even for the entire Empire.\nHowever, since Krylak was part of his daughter-in-law’s family, Matis held back. If it had been anyone else, he wouldn’t have hesitated to scold them. The nerve of even thinking about taking his granddaughter!\nRealizing the Alliance’s firm stance, Krylak looked disappointed but quickly changed tactics. He signaled to the four family elders, who nodded in agreement.\nWith their backing, Krylak turned to Fleur, wearing a sorrowful expression.\n\"Cousin Fleur, you should understand the importance of a holy child for a clan within the Empire. I don’t ask for Arix to become a permanent member of our clan; I only hope Arix can represent our clan as the holy child, while also being part of the Alliance’s Kering family. This is my humble request.\"\nKrylak’s plea was as humble as possible, and the elders joined in to express their grievances.\n\"Our clan hasn’t had a pureblood cub in a hundred years. We’ve faced countless discriminations, and it breaks my heart,\" Faelan lamented, looking like an ancient figure watching his nation fall apart. His face was full of endless pain and sorrow.\n\"Yes, we elders don’t care about those discriminations, but the young ones in our clan are innocent,\" Rowtag added.\n\"Fleur, we are all old and will soon be dead. This is our last wish before we die. Can’t you understand?\" Bran said.\nKylian, meanwhile, was at a loss. Everyone else had delivered their emotional performances so well that there was nothing left for him to say.\nHowever, he knew that if he didn’t put on some sort of act, he’d face the others’ displeasure later.\nResolving himself, Kylian began to tear up, presenting the image of an elderly man shedding tears.\nThe Alliance members watched the Empire’s elders with deadpan expressions. To be honest, they didn’t even feel a thing. Little did they expect that one among them was from the Tiger clan.\nFleur, overwhelmed with empathy, started crying. Though she grew up in the Alliance, the Tiger clan was her home, her roots.\nSeeing his wife in tears, Thaddeus felt his heart ache and immediately looked to his father for help.\nMatis: .....\n’This spineless son of mine! Your wife hasn’t even spoken yet, and you’re already panicking!’",

      "content": "Chapter 130: Multiple Identity\nAfter a moment, Mr. Kering sighed and exchanged a look with Zeta, who nodded in agreement.\nMatis turned to the people of the Empire and said, \"I understand your difficulties, but ultimately, it depends on her own wishes. If Arix agrees, she’ll be part of both the Kering family of the Alliance, and the Tiger clan of the Empire.\"\n\"Great, thank you for your generosity,\" Faelan quickly replied, eager to seal the deal and offered an abundance of praise.\nAlpha Leonidas, seeing the discussion winding down, felt his presence was no longer necessary. He had only been there as a witness, and he was ready to wrap things up.\nJust as he was about to turn off his end of the holographic video, Luna Amethyst tugged at his sleeve, giving him a meaningful look and whispering, \"Our future in-laws might be here, be polite.\"\nAlpha Leonidas’ hand pulsed mid-air.\nTaking a deep breath, Alpha Leonidas forced a stiff smile. His eyes, trying to appear gentle, still held a cold, sharp edge as he looked at the people of the Alliance, especially the Kering family.\nThe Kering family, chatting \"amiably\" with the Tiger clan, froze under Alpha Leonidas’s gaze.\nThey thought he was displeased with the outcome. Even Zeta, the president of the Alliance, seemed a bit shaky.\nEveryone worried that if something went wrong, a war might erupt between the Alliance and the Empire today.\nThe Tiger clan also thought Alpha Leonidas was unhappy with the result. They had never seen such a terrifying expression on his face.\n’Is he so angry that he’s lost his sanity? Is that why his features look so twisted?’\nAs the Tiger clan members pondered whether they should try to calm Alpha Leonidas down, he suddenly spoke, \"For your generosity, the Empire will not initiate war against the Alliance for the next hundred years. Additionally, the Aqualis Region will still be given to the Alliance as a gesture of goodwill from the Empire.\"\nWith that, Alpha Leonidas immediately disconnected the holographic video.\nAway from prying eyes, Alpha Leonidas stared blankly at Luna Amethyst.\nShe knew exactly what he was thinking. He almost messed up the act and still wanted praise.\nSmiling and shaking her head with a sigh, Luna Amethyst ruffled Alpha Leonidas’s hair, saying, \"My dear Leo, well done.\"\nHearing what he wanted, Alpha Leonidas nodded reservedly, a visible smile curving his lips.\nMeanwhile, the Alliance members, still in the holographic meeting, were left stunned by Alpha Leonidas’s words for quite a while.\nBut once the situation sank in, both Zeta and the Kering family members shifted from initial reluctance to more joyful expressions.\nLosing the ten mechas paled compared to having the ruler of the Empire personally promise not to initiate war for a hundred years. This assurance was worth far more than the mechas and even the Aqualis Region.\nIn the end, this international meeting wrapped up on a high note, with both sides getting satisfactory answers.\nNow, it all hinged on Arix’s decision. Both sides agreed to honor her choice, whatever it might be.\nAfter the meeting, Krylak sent an urgent message to Arix’s opticomputer, asking her to come to the conference room immediately.\nMeanwhile, Arix had just seen Cassian off and was about to head back to her villa when she got the message.\nFrowning, she figured Krylak had something important to discuss and quickly made her way to the conference room.\nWhen she entered, she was surprised to see her grandfather and the others there.\nArix paused for a moment, then greeted everyone from both the Alliance and the Empire.\nThanks to the language converter, the Alliance members understood her perfectly this time.\nEveryone present nodded appreciatively. There was nothing more likable than a talented and polite junior.\nAfter the greetings, they got down to business. Both the Alliance and Empire members looked towards Zeta to start the conversation. Given his high position and lack of direct relation to Arix, he was the natural choice to lead the discussion.\nZeta coughed and thought to himself,\n’Being the president is tough enough for me; and now it even comes down to handling these sorts of delicate family matters?’\nTaking a deep breath, Zeta put on a friendly smile and spoke softly to Arix, \"Arix, how would you feel about taking on an additional role?\"\n\"An additional role?\" Arix’s round, tiger-like eyes looked at Zeta curiously.\n\"Ahem, let me be clearer.\" Matis shot a glance at Zeta, unhappy with his vague approach.\nZeta wanted to snap back at Matis,\n’If you think you can do better, go ahead!’\nbut he refraied himself.\nSeeing Zeta’s troubled expression, Arix wasn’t sure what he wanted to say but kindly helped him out, \"Sir, it’s okay. You can just tell me.\"\nZeta was moved.\n’What a considerate and understanding child she is, so different from her often troublesome grandfather.’\nZeta didn’t waste any more time. He directly explained what had just transpired, including Alpha Leonidas’s promise.\n\"Arix, if you agree, you’ll still be Arix in the Alliance, but in the Empire, you’ll become a cub of the Tiger clan family. If you don’t want to, that’s fine too. We respect your decision, so don’t feel pressured.\" Zeta gave her a reassuring smile.\nUnderstanding what Zeta meant, Arix tilted her head and blinked, thinking it over. This really did mean taking on an additional role.\nIf Arix decided to join the Tiger clan now, it could pave the way for a genuine friendship between the Empire and the Alliance. Plus, the Alliance would gain control of the Aqualis Region. The Tiger clan would also put their worries about pureblood cubs to rest.\nIf Arix chose not to join, the Alliance wouldn’t lose much. However, the Tiger clan would likely face tough times ahead.\nAfter an afternoon of Cassian explaining things, Arix realized just how vital a pureblood cub is to a therian clan. The Empire’s therians all worship the Moon Goddess, and a pureblood cub, also known as a divine child, is considered Her offspring.\nA therian family without a pureblood cub is seen as forsaken by the Moon Goddess. If it weren’t for the Tiger clan’s privilege of having members serve as Pontifex at the Moon Goddess Temple, they would have been weakened or even taken over by other families, especially the Dragon clan, which has always been greedy for others’ wealth.\nLately, since the Tiger clan hasn’t had a pureblood cub, the Dragon clan has been more open about their ambitions. If the Tiger clan shows any sign of weakness, the Dragon clan would likely pounce.\nSo, becoming the Tiger clan’s cub benefits everyone, including Arix. There’s no reason to hesitate over something that’s good for all parties.\nAfter thinking it over, Arix looked up and said, \"I am willing to join the Tiger clan.\"\n\"Great!\" Krylak was unable to contain his excitement upon hearing Arix’s answer. He jumped up and announced, \"I, Krylak, the 72nd head of the Tiger clan, declare that from today, Arix is the pureblood cub of the Tiger clan!\"\nAs soon as he finished speaking, everyone in the conference room began clapping. Amidst the applause, Thaddeus and Fleur looked at Arix with tears of pride and joy in their eyes.\nThus, Arix became the pureblood cub of the Tiger clan.\nThe Tiger clan members, upon hearing the news, celebrated with great enthusiasm.\nFireworks lit up the dark night sky.\nIn the villa’s study, Arix perched by the window, lifting her little head to gaze at the night sky. Countless fireworks shot into the sky, bursting into blooms of red, yellow, and green. The fireworks, like falling stars, seemed almost within reach.\nArix watched quietly for a long time, even as Scion, who was handling the Tiger Legion’s business, finished his opticomputer files.\nScion tidied up the desk, then quietly walked over to Arix. He stood by her side in silence, watching the fireworks outside the window.\n\"Scion,\" Arix suddenly said, her eyes still glued to the colorful display in the sky.\n\"Hm?\" Scion turned his attention to her, puzzled, as she continued to stare at the fireworks.\nArix then looked up at Scion, her face a mix of curiosity and concern. \"Did you want to be the next Pontifex, Scion?\"\nIn the past, Arix would never have questioned this. But after learning about the fate of a pureblood cub, she wondered if Scion had really chosen his path voluntarily.\nScion stayed silent for a long moment before replying, \"Probably not at the time.\"\nHe looked up at the fireworks; memories of a young boy crying by a small lake flashed through his mind. That boy, who didn’t want to become the next Pontifex but couldn’t defy his parents, felt utterly lost.",

      "content": "Chapter 131: Taking Mecha Lessons\nAfter Scion’s bloodline was tested to be of the sixth level, his parents began to distance themselves.\nThey knew their child would soon enter the Moon Goddess Temple and become an emotionless Pontifex. So, instead of investing their emotions in him, they showered all their love on his younger brother.\nLittle Scion couldn’t understand what he had done wrong, and why his parents abandoned him after his bloodline was tested.\nHe hid in dark corners every day, watching his family interact lovingly, searching for answers. But every time he watched, his heart broke a little more.\nWhen his parents saw him by chance, they would respectfully bow and quickly leave with his younger brother.\nOver time, Scion’s spirit eroded. He didn’t know when it started, but he gradually felt abandoned by the world and began to abandon the world in return.\nKrylak, however, always smiled at him. Krylak wasn’t the brightest in the clan but was definitely the kindest to Scion. He once told Scion, \"If you don’t want to go, then don’t.\"\nKrylak, who later became the clan leader, found countless reasons to delay Scion’s entry into the Moon Goddess Temple.\nKrylak was had no blood relation with Scion, but he was more like a father than anyone else. Scion would likely have been a heartless automaton by now, if Krylak hadn’t been there for him.\nSeeing the sadness in Scion’s eyes, Arix jumped into his arms and nuzzled him with her head, offering silent comfort.\nWith a comforting tone, Arix softly howled, \"It’s okay, Scion. I’ve become the pureblood cub now, so you don’t have to be the Pontifex anymore.\"\nScion felt a warmth in his heart and patted Arix’s small head. However, he neither agreed nor disagreed with her words.\nAs a child, Scion might have felt powerless, but as an adult, he had long since gained the ability to make his own decisions.\nScion remembered Krylak, who always opposed the elders just to delay his entry into the Moon Goddess Temple. He also thought of the elders who always said he had to leave, but they never took any forceful action.\nA slight smile formed at the corner of Scion’s mouth, and his eyes softened. His pupils, reflecting the fireworks, shone more brilliantly than the stars in the night sky.\nThe fireworks bloomed brilliantly in the night sky, and the two by the window, one big and one small, watched quietly, soaking in the moment.\nTime passed silently in this beautiful scene. Around 1 AM, Arix suddenly let out a loud cry.\nStartled by the piercing sound, Scion looked over, puzzled.\n\"Oh no, oh no, Scion, I forgot I have online classes tomorrow! I need to go to bed now. Bye!\" Arix exclaimed.\nThen the little cub bolted out of the study like a fire had been lit under them.\nWatching the small cub disappear quickly, Scion’s eyes crinkled slightly at the corners. A hearty and pleasant laugh bubbled up from his throat.\n...\nThe next morning, bright and early, Arix struggled to get out of her small bed and freshen up. She then settled at her desk and fired up the opticomputer her school provided.\nThe virtual screen blinked to life, and the Department of Chemistry icon was already glowing, showing she was late. Her paw hovered for a moment before she quickly clicked it.\nThe screen displayed the face of the Chemistry teacher, who noticed her arrival. Adjusting his glasses, he said gently, \"Arix, you’re late. Try to be on time next time.\"\nHearing the teacher’s voice, Arix quickly typed an apology and sent it as a subtitle on the screen.\nArix: Sorry, sir. I’ll be earlier next time.\n\"Alright, no problem. Let’s continue the class,\" the teacher replied. Then, he dove into the origins of potions and how different medicines counteract each other.\nMost of the potion content was review for Arix, so she treated it as a refresher.\nAfter Chemistry, Arix quickly switched to the Department of Mecha Manufacture. Normally, students had free study time after class, but Arix was enrolled in three departments.\nThe Psychic Ware Department’s class conflicted with Mecha Manufacture, so she recorded the Psychic Ware class to watch later. Then, she tuned into the Mecha Manufacture class, watching it like a live stream.\nAt that moment, the mecha teacher stood next to a large virtual teaching screen, showing a webpage with different mecha grades.\nMecha Grades:\nSupergiant-Class = level-eight mecha\nSupergiant-Class = level-seven mecha\nSubgiant-Class = level-six mecha\nStar-Class = level-five mecha\nPlanet-Class = level-four mecha\nMoon-Class = level-three mecha\nComet-Class = level-two mecha\nMeteor-Class = level-one mecha\n\"Mechas are divided into grades. The highest is the level-eight mecha. These are national treasures, and I’ve never even seen one,\" the teacher said with a sigh.\n\"There’s a legend that level-eight mechas evolve into mechanical life forms. So, if you see an elderly man fighting or even cleaning, he might just be a level-eight mecha. Especially among the five major families of the Alliance,\" he added mysteriously.\nAs the classmates buzzed with chatter, Arix scratched her head.\n’Is Grandpa a level-eight mecha? But he fathered Dad, so... it seems unlikely.’\nStill, when she returned to the Alliance, she’d keep an eye on the family elders. There might just be a level-eight mecha among them.\nArix’s eyes sparkled, feeling like a new world had just opened up to her.\nWhen the mecha class wrapped up, Arix had an instinct to send a gift, but after searching in vain, she realized she was in a class, not a live stream.\nAlmost laughing at herself, she yawned and stretched.\nWith more classes coming up in the afternoon, she drank a bottle of nutritious fluid and went back to bed for a quick nap.\nAt moments like these, Arix couldn’t help but feel a bit envious of Drexel. His courses from the Department of Strategy and Commanding and the Department of Combat were all in the afternoon, letting him sleep in even if he gamed late the night before.\nAnnoyed, Arix grumbled to herself before drifting off to sleep.\n\"Hey, Arix, wake up for class! How can you still be sleeping in the afternoon?\" Drexel, full of energy, knocked on Arix’s door. He was ready to join her for their online classes.\nArix really wanted to toss her brother out.\nShe opened the door to let Drexel in. She too lazy to even wash her face since the teacher couldn’t see her anyway.\nAfter putting up with Drexel’s scolding, the two started their first class of the afternoon.\n\"In the ancient times, the famous general Lepidas fought 100 battles without a single defeat, creating numerous classic military strategies,\" the Strategy and Commanding teacher said. \"His success was due to his extensive reading of military texts and eagerness to learn.\"\nThe teacher seemed to idolize that general, and he dedicated almost the entire class to discussing his achievements. Arix feel like she was reading some fan fiction.\n\"For homework, read\nThe Art of War\n. I’ll check your memorization tomorrow. Class dismissed,\" the teacher concluded, abruptly ending the live stream.\nAfter class, Arix searched for the two books and added them to her library. She glanced at Drexel, who was leisurely playing games on his opticomputer.\n\"Aren’t you going to read the books?\" Arix asked, puzzled.\n\"No need. I know these books by heart,\" Drexel replied with a smug grin. His confident expression made it clear he considered everyone else amateurs.\nAs the heir of the Kering family, Drexel had been trained in these subjects from a young age. Not just these two books, but nearly any book on military strategy, Drexel could recite them without a single word missing.\nArix rolled her eyes, not bothering to retort for once.\nThe second class of the afternoon was the one Arix had been looking forward to: the Department of Combat. To prep for this class, Arix even took out and polished the level-two mecha she had received as a school reward.\nSeeing this, Drexel scratched his head, looking like he wanted to say something but held back.\n\"Hey, Arix, class is about to start. What are you doing?\" Drexel finally asked.\n\"I’m polishing my mecha, can’t you see? We need it for class,\" Arix replied, giving Drexel a look that said he was stating the obvious.\nNow it was Drexel’s turn to be baffled. With a twitch of his mouth, he asked, \"Who told you that you need a real mecha for the Department of Combat class?\"\n\"Then what should I prepare for the class?\" Arix stopped her polishing, looking confused.\n\"Of course, you need this,\" Drexel said, pulling out the Connective Pod that Cassian had given him from his Space Button.\nArix glanced at the Connective Pod on the floor, then back at Drexel. She gave him a look of disdain and skepticism, \"Drexel, seriously, I got no time for jokes.\"\nHalf an hour later, on the Alliance interstellarnet, Arix stood on a virtual street, feeling a bit guilty for having scolded Drexel. She turned to Drexel and said, \"Sorry, you were right.\"\n\"Haha, that’s what you get for not using the interstellarnet enough. Probably the entire Alliance knows that beginners start by familiarizing themselves with mechas here,\" Drexel teased triumphantly.\nArix ignored Drexel’s smug expression and opened her virtual opticomputer. She entered the location their tutor had given earlier. After clicking the teleport button, she vanished from the spot.\n\"Hey, wait for me!\" Drexel, still chuckling, quickly opened the location and teleported after his sister.",

      "content": "Chapter 132: An Unexpected Mentor\nThe Department of Combat’s mentor selection event took place in a huge simulation hall. When Arix got there, the place was already packed with students.\nThe moment Arix’s virtual Psychic Incarnation showed up, silence fell over the room. Then, a wave of cheers erupted, nearly lifting the roof off.\n\"Whoa, look, it’s Arix, the one who invented the psychic power healing potion!\"\n\"Arix, I’m a huge fan! Can I get your autograph?\"\n\"Me too! I want one too!\"\nAs soon as they recognized Arix, the students swarmed her, eagerly pulling out all sorts of things for her to sign.\nFeeling flattered, Arix didn’t turn them down, so almost everyone walked away with a signature.\nLuckily, the Department of Combat wasn’t too big, so Arix wrapped up the signing session pretty fast.\nGrinning from ear to ear, the students gradually left the hall with their prized autographs.\nIn the end, only Maya, Rei, and Dae-jung were left. They were also from the Department of Combat.\nSeeing her old friends, Arix beamed, arms wide open. \"Maya, Rei, Dae-jung, I’m back.\"\nRei and Maya, laughing in tears, rushed to hug her tightly.\n\"Arix, where have you been? We were so worried!\" Rei’s voice cracked as tears ran down her cheeks.\n\"I heard you were still in the hospital. Were you badly hurt?\" Maya asked, her voice thick with concern.\nDae-jung stayed silent, but his worried eyes spoke volumes.\n\"I’m fine now, really. I’ll be back to school soon,\" Arix assured them, carefully picking her words to ease their worry.\n\"Are you lying again? If you’re okay, why haven’t you come back yet?\" Rei shot her a teary-eyed glare.\n\"I’m not lying. I’ll be back soon, Rei, so don’t cry,\" Arix said gently, wiping away Rei’s tears.\n\"You better not be lying, or you’ll regret it!\" Rei huffed.\n\"Don’t worry, it’s the truth. If you don’t believe me, ask Drexel.\" Arix quickly diverted the attention as Drexel arrived.\nDrexel had just walked in and was clueless about what was going on.\nRei glanced at Drexel. Seeing no odd reaction from him, she finally believed Arix.\nWith Rei convinced, Arix breathed a sigh of relief and swiftly changed the subject, \"By the way, who’s our mecha pilot mentor? Why haven’t we seen them yet?\"\nEven Rei was caught off guard by this. She knew the answer but was surprised Arix didn’t.\n\"Your mentor is, of course, your dashing, charming, and utterly irresistible Uncle Marlone,\" Marlone announced, popping up behind Arix with a cheeky grin.\n\"Uncle Marlone,\" Arix groaned, facepalming. A bad feeling washed over her as she thought about what lay ahead.\nAs soon as Marlone, the mentor for the Department of Combat, stepped in, the students quickly lined up.\n\"Alright, today’s task is simple. Each of you needs to kill 100 insectoids. Drexel, for you, make that 1000. No problem, right?\" Marlone asked, giving Drexel a mock affectionate look.\n\"That’s not fair! I objection!\" Drexel protested.\n\"Overruled. You got a problem with 1000? Then let’s make it 2000. That’s the spirit of our top student in the Department of Combat. Everyone, follow his example,\" Marlone said, giving Drexel a fake thumbs up.\n\"Way to go, Drexel! You’re the best!\"\n\"Drexel, you can do it! We believe in you!\"\n\"Nice!\"\nThe students, used to this routine, joined in the fun, cheering for Drexel.\nDrexel muttered under his breath but didn’t dare argue, fearing his target would increase again.\nWith a scowl, he opened the nearest simulation room. He picked a level-five mecha from the virtual opticomputer’s warehouse, jumped into the cockpit, and started attacking the swarm of insectoids with the mecha’s silver spear, venting his frustration.\nThe other students followed suit, albeit more clumsily. Many were still learning to pilot a mecha and were quickly overwhelmed by the insectoids, getting ejected from the simulation room by the system.\nFortunately, their kills still counted, so they just re-entered and continued the fight.\nWatching the action unfold, Arix felt her adrenaline spike. She clenched her fists, ready to join the fray, but a large hand stopped her by gently grabbing her head.\nTurning, she saw it was Marlone. \"What’s up, Uncle Marlone?\" she asked, confused.\n\"At the military academy, you should call me ’sir,’ okay?\" Marlone said with an unusual serious expression. He never wanted to treat anyone differently.\nDrexel, hearing this, thought to himself,\n\"Yeah, right, that ’not liking to treat them differently’ crap again!\"\nArix nodded obediently. \"Sir, do you need something?\"\n\"Arix, it’s your first time piloting a mecha today. Don’t push yourself too hard. Just do your best,\" Marlone said, gently patting her head.\nArix nodded again, taking his advice to heart. Then she glanced at Drexel with worry. \"Will Drexel be okay? He has to kill 20 times more than us.\"\n\"Him?\" Marlone’s face shifted from gentle to disdainful, as if he was hating Drexel for not being good enough. It was clear he wanted to kick Drexel but held back, only because Arix was watching.\nMarlone frowned and pursed his lips in frustration, but he managed to keep his cool for Arix’s sake.\n\"Arix, don’t worry. Your brother is just a lazy donkey who won’t move without a whip. With his talent, if he put in some effort, even Supergiant+ physical power would be within his reach,\" Marlone said, thinking that the 2000 insectoid task was too lenient and mentally added another 1000 for next time.\nArix shivered at the thought and decided it was best not to ask Marlone any more questions. She figured that if she kept asking, Drexel’s life would get even more, well, \"exciting.\"\nArix felt a wave of sympathy for Drexel and softly whispered, \"Amen.\"\nAfter that, she bid farewell to Marlone and stepped into an empty simulation room. From the outside, it looked small, but once inside, it was as big as a training field.\nWith just three minutes on the countdown timer flashing on the virtual screen, Arix didn’t have time to waste. She quickly accessed the virtual opticomputer and navigated to the mecha storage place.\nShe picked the cheapest mecha available. Why? Because she was broke! That’s why!\nHolding back tears, she forked over 100,000 astrocredits and got a level-one mecha that came with nothing but a sword.\nPulling the mecha from the system’s storage, Arix swiftly climbed into the cockpit. Following the manual step-by-step, she established the connection with the mecha.\nJust as the connection was complete, the countdown hit zero.\nBig, blood-red letters popped up on the screen: \"Insectoids approaching! Soldiers, get ready!\"\nArix swallowed hard, controlling the mecha to grip the sword tightly, ready for action. Although it wasn’t a real battlefield, the interstellar era’s tech made the experience feel totally real.\nIt was like being inside a game, experiencing everything firsthand. The only difference was you wouldn’t actually die.\n\"Hiss----!\" The first insectoid appeared in the simulation room. It looked like a giant, black mantis, with terrifying mouthparts and sharp forelimbs, covered in a layer of armor-like skin.\nJust seeing it was enough to make anyone’s heart pound with fear.\nFacing the insectoid, which was three times the height of her mecha, Arix instinctively put some distance between them. But the insectoid, seeing Arix as a tasty meal, charged forward excitedly.\nAs the insectoid attacked, Arix raised her sword, barely managing to block the strike.\n\"Hiss---!\" The insectoid, frustrated by its failed attack, let out an angry screech. It quickly raised its forelimbs again, thrusting them toward Arix.\nNot wanting to take the hit head-on, Arix made her mecha leap back just in time. Unfortunately, her landing was far from smooth, and she nearly face-planted.\nTerrified, Arix hurriedly pressed several buttons on the virtual keyboard in the mecha cockpit, barely managing to regain control and avoid a complete wipeout.\nArix took a deep breath as she regained her balance, and then she glared at the insectoid with a mix of relief and irritation.\nMaybe it was the anger that fueled her, but her subsequent maneuvers were smooth and precise.\nBefore long, she had sliced the insectoid in half with a single stroke.\nHowever, she didn’t have a moment to relax. As soon as the first insectoid fell, two more appeared in the simulation room.\n\"Come on! Give me a break!\" Arix muttered.\nThen came two more, then four, then eight... The place was soon swarming with insectoids. All around, students were fighting furiously to take them down.",

      "content": "Chapter 133: Getting The Money Back\nOutside the simulation room, Marlone was observing the students closely.\nMost of the students had been training for several days, but their mecha control skills were still a bit clumsy.\nMarlone understood, though, since 80% of the students at the Hecaris Military Academy came from Planet Waste. Many of them probably hadn’t had much experience piloting a mecha, let alone using one in combat.\nYet, it was also true that some students from Planet Waste, upon getting into the prestigious Hecaris Military Academy, had let it go to their heads. They thought they were hotshots now and started slacking off.\nMarlone’s eyes narrowed as he looked at a few students who had only managed to kill four insectoids since the session began.\nAs they were still dawdling, Marlone approached them from behind and said in a cold, stern voice, \"If you’re not here to train seriously, then get out of the Department of Combat. If you don’t want to be soldiers, then get out of the Hecaris Military Academy. You’re here to learn how to protect the people and your country, not to live a cushy life. If that’s what you want, go back to stealing—you might strike it rich that way!\"\nMarlone’s harsh words were like ice water, snapping the students back to reality.\nThey were future soldiers, not here for an easy life. They had worked hard to get into this academy, and slacking off now would make all that effort meaningless.\n\"Sorry, sir! We understand now!\" the students shouted, their voices full of determination.\nWith renewed vigor, they attacked the insectoids as if facing their worst enemies.\nSatisfied with their change in attitude, Marlone nodded approvingly and moved on to check other simulation rooms.\n\"Casper, if you’re a man, show some strength. Stop acting like a delicate doll.\"\n\"Tam, how many times do I have to tell you? Watch your positioning! Watch your positioning!\"\n\"Cirus, while it’s brave to go for mutual destruction, do you really want to die alongside these low-level insectoids on the battlefield? That’s not a worthwhile trade!\"\nAs Marlone continued his rounds, he eventually came to Arix’s simulation room. Watching Arix, who was still a bit clumsy but managing to take down insectoids with a single strike, Marlone’s eyes filled with pride. A smile crept onto his face despite himself.\n\"Arix, great job! Fantastic! Yes, just like that! Awesome!\" Marlone, in a surprising change from his usual sharp tongue, showered Arix with praise.\nArix felt nothing but sheer embarrassment, while the students in the surrounding simulation rooms looked on with envy.\nMarlone reminded Arix not to overexert herself and then, somewhat reluctantly, moved on to the next simulation room. Everywhere he went, he delivered a round of scathing motivational comments.\nFinally, Marlone reached Drexel’s simulation room.\nSeeing the screen display a kill count of 965 insectoids, Marlone nodded in satisfaction and said, \"Well done, Drexel. While others have only taken down twenty or thirty insectoids, you’ve nearly hit a thousand. Looks like next time, we’ll need 3,000 insectoids to give you a real challenge.\"\nAs expected, Marlone then heard Drexel’s exasperated groan, almost as if he were coughing up blood from the stress.\nWith a mischievous smile, Marlone felt a deep sense of satisfaction and concluded his rounds for the day.\nArix’s mecha was so beat up from the long battle that it looked like a shadow of its former self.\nEach time it got hit, Arix felt like she took the blow too.\nShe had poured 100,000 astrocredits into that machine!\nWith every new dent and crack, her attacks only grew fiercer. She had spent nearly all her savings on a Supergiant-Class psychic power healing potion, leaving her with about 100,000 astrocredits left. Buying this mecha today had pretty much emptied her account.\nBeing broke brought anxiety, irritation, and a fiery anger that made her want to squash bugs. This mix of rage and desperation ramped up Arix’s attack power by 200%.\nBefore her mecha completely gave out, Arix managed to take down the final insectoid. As it fell, the battered mecha, pushed past its limits, started to break down. Its sword-wielding arm dropped off first, then the right leg, and soon, the whole thing began to collapse like a row of dominoes.\nAfter the deafening crash, Arix crawled out from the cockpit, shaky but determined. She stood on unsteady legs and looked back at the pile of scrap that was her mecha.\n\"Thanks, old buddy. I won’t forget your sacrifice. Amen,\" she said, before heading out of the simulation room.\nOutside, others had finished their missions. Only a few were still standing, catching their breath. Most were sprawled on the floor, including Drexel.\nArix walked over and helped Drexel to his feet, supporting him with her shoulder.\nShe just felt a bit embarrassed for Drexel, but Drexel didn’t see it that way. He thought Arix was just worried about him lying on the cold ground and felt deeply moved.\n\"Thanks, Arix. I misjudged you before. You’re the greatest sister in the world,\" Drexel said, his spirits lifting instantly from her gesture.\nArix blinked, feeling like Drexel had gotten the wrong idea. But then she remembered her empty bank account and her eyes lit up.\nShe said sweetly, \"And you’re the greatest brother! By the way, do you have any money?\"\n\"Yes! Last month, my online store made a profit of 10 million,\" Drexel, still basking in the sibling love, blurted out without any guard.\n’What a goldmine!’\nArix’s eyes sparkled with excitement as she tried to hide her emotions. She then put on a pitiful look and said, \"Drexel, I’m out of money. Can you give me 5 million?\"\n\"Sure, no problem!\" Drexel immediately transferred the money to Arix.\nAs his balance dropped by 5 million, Drexel’s brain, previously clouded by sibling affection, began to catch up. He opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but Arix interrupted him.\n\"Thank you, you’re the best brother in the world,\" Arix said sweetly, putting extra emphasis on \"brother\" in the most sugary tone possible.\nDrexel’s mouth trembled even more, and the combined mental and physical shock caused him to pass out on Arix’s shoulder.\nFeeling the sudden weight on her shoulder, Arix touched her nose, feeling a rare pang of guilt. This naive guy was still her brother, after all. She couldn’t milk him too hard; if she drove him to ruin, it would be her loss.\nWith this thought, Arix transferred back 4 million and sent a message to his opticomputer.\n\"Bro, borrowing 1 million temporarily. I’ll deduct it from next month’s store profits.\"\nAfter doing all this, Arix felt a bit proud of herself, thinking she truly was the best sister in the world.\nOnce all the military students had completed their tasks, the Department of Combat class came to an end.\nMarlone checked each student’s record in the simulation room on his opticomputer, nodded in satisfaction, and said, \"Today’s class is over. See you all tomorrow.\"\n\"See you tomorrow, sir,\" the students replied in unison, saying the most insincere words.\nAfter the dismissal, everyone quickly logged off.\nAfter saying goodbye to her uncle, Arix logged off too.\nWaking up from the Connective Pod, Arix jumped out and patted the pod next to her, calling, \"Get up for dinner.\"\n\"I’m not eating,\" Drexel said angrily. If he hadn’t realized by now that he had been tricked by his sister, he would truly be a fool.\n\"Come on, check your opticomputer,\" Arix said, rolling her eyes.\nDrexel glanced at Arix, and skeptically opened his opticomputer.\nHe saw the transfer and Arix’s message.\nSeeing his funds mostly intact, he instantly revived. He jumped out of his pod, hugged Arix, and rubbed her head. \"Ah, you still care about me.\"\n\"Of course, I am the best sister,\" Arix said, proudly puffing out her chest.\n\"So, world’s best sister, how about increasing my share of the online store profits by 5%?\" Drexel asked, eyes shining.\n\"No! Way!\" Arix replied, smiling sweetly but firmly.\nDrexel choked on her words.\n’Just how stupid was I earlier to think this trickster is the best sister in the world?’",

      "content": "Chapter 134: Exchange Students\nArix and Drexel strolled towards the dining hall, playfully bantering along the way. As they entered, they spotted not just Scion, but Krylak as well.\nThey greeted Scion and Krylak with respect.\nScion glanced up, giving them a gentle nod. Krylak, with a warm, almost grandfatherly smile, motioned them to sit. \"Sit down,\" he said, his expression kind as if they were his treasured babies.\nOnce seated, Arix and Drexel turned their attention to Krylak, curiosity evident on their faces.\nSensing their curiosity, Krylak smiled and got right to the point. From his Space Button, he produced two envelopes adorned with the Hecaris Military Academy crest. He handed one to each sibling.\nDrexel took his envelope, looking puzzled, and glanced at Krylak for an explanation.\n\"Open them,\" Krylak encouraged, noticing they were just holding the envelopes.\nExchanging a look, Arix and Drexel nodded at each other. Drexel then opened his envelope and took out the letter inside. The bold words at the top left them momentarily stunned.\nAlliance Exchange Student Recommendation Letter\nDear Imperial Royal Military Academy:\nWe are thrilled to have our students participate in this exchange program with your prestigious academy. This is an excellent chance for mutual learning and exchange between our institutions. After a thorough selection process, we believe Arix and Drexel Kering are the perfect candidates for this exchange and hope your academy will accept them. On behalf of our academy, we express our sincere gratitude.\nAs they finished reading, Krylak began to explain. \"Every year, the Empire and the Alliance have a week-long exchange program. Since you two are already here in the Empire, we thought it would be a great opportunity for you both. What do you think, Arix? If you’re not interested, I can decline on your behalf.\"\nThe Imperial Royal Military Academy was the Empire’s top military school, renowned for its exceptional faculty. Rumor had it that passing their assessments came with substantial rewards.\nMoreover, in a year’s time, the Empire and the Alliance would host a major mecha competition for military students from across the universe. This exchange program seemed like the perfect chance to gather intel on their strongest competitors.\nArix and Drexel shared a knowing glance, each understanding the other’s thoughts. Then, they both grinned.\n\"Drexel and I would love to be exchange students,\" Arix said, raising a hand.\nDrexel nodded in agreement.\n\"Great, it’s settled then. Get a good night’s rest tonight. Tomorrow, Targon will take you both to the school,\" Krylak instructed with a smile.\n\"Alright,\" the siblings replied obediently.\nArix suddenly remembered they were representing the Alliance. \"Sir, who is the Empire sending to the Alliance? Are they going to the Hecaris Military Academy?\" she asked curiously.\nKrylak’s expression turned a bit awkward. He hesitated before revealing the truth.\n\"This time, the Empire is sending two students from the Dragon Clan. They were supposed to go to Hecaris, but they chose Koros Military Academy instead. The school had to respect their choice,\" Krylak said carefully.\nIn reality, those Dragon Clan students had almost insulted Hecaris, calling it worthless. They believed the students, mostly from humble backgrounds, had nothing valuable to learn from.\nKrylak recalled the presidents of both academies almost had a fallout over this.\nWithout further explanation, Arix and Drexel understood the situation.\nThey exchanged glances, their eyes now filled with determination.\nLater, in Arix’s Room...\nThe siblings sat in Arix’s room—one on the bed, the other on a chair—waiting for the other to speak first. Finally, Arix broke the silence.\n\"So, should we deal with those Dragon Clan guys?\" Arix asked coldly.\n\"Absolutely, we need to deal with them,\" Drexel replied without hesitation.\n\"How do we deal with them? Directly or subtly?\" Arix asked, her eyes glinting.\n\"I’ll handle it directly; you can be more subtle,\" Drexel said with a sinister smile.\n\"Alright! Let’s rest up for tomorrow’s battle,\" Arix said, slapping her hand decisively.\n\"Before sleeping, I need to do something first,\" Drexel said, taking out his communicator and starting to type.\nArix was curious. \"What are you doing? Are you planning something?\"\nShe thought her brother was thorough, even planning their confrontation with the Dragon Clan students.\n\"Hold on, I’m almost done,\" Drexel said, typing furiously.\nAfter a short while, he finished and projected the message on the virtual screen for Arix to see.\nAt first glance, Arix thought she must be seeing things.\nThe message read:\nComplaint Letter\nI, freshman Drexel, am reporting Department of Combat Mentor Marlone for serious double standards, which have deeply hurt my fragile feelings. I request the school to dock his bonus!\n\"This is what you spent so much time writing?\" Arix looked at Drexel as if he were an idiot.\n\"How does it look? I’m planning to send it tonight,\" Drexel said with a mischievous grin.\nArix was speechless. She realized she had overestimated her brother.\nArix took a deep breath, then used her psychic power to bind Drexel. She opened the door and tossed him out of the room.\n\"Hey, Arix, what are you doing?\" Drexel yelled, dazed as he stood up and rubbed his sore bottom, looking incredibly hurt.\n\"Drexel, I’m warning you. If you can’t take down those Dragon clan guys tomorrow, you might as well prepare to be taken down yourself,\" Arix said, making a throat-slitting gesture as she spoke.\nWithout waiting for Drexel’s response, she waved her hand and slammed the door shut.\n\"She’s turning into a real ruthless tiger,\" Drexel muttered to himself as he looked at the closed door. Then he went back to his room to rest.\nThe next day, at the entrance of the Imperial Royal Military Academy.\nArix and Drexel crouched in a shadowy corner, whispering conspiratorially.\n\"From now on, we’re the bad guys. When we get into the school, we’ll provoke them non-stop, and then we’ll give them a good thrashing,\" Arix said fiercely, demonstrating several attack poses and even letting out a domineering growl.\n\"Yeah, we’re the bad guys now,\" Drexel nodded vigorously but then scratched his head in confusion. \"But, how exactly do bad guys act?\"\nArix took a sharp breath and looked at Drexel as if he were an alien. \"Haven’t you ever seen a bad guy before?!\"\n\"I have, but I usually finish them off before they can do anything bad,\" Drexel admitted honestly.\nGiven Drexel’s strength, anyone who tried to mess with him usually ended up incapacitated before they could act.\n\"What’s your impression of a bad guy, then?\" Arix probed.\nDrexel pondered for a moment, rubbing his chin. Then, he suddenly spat on the ground.\n\"What are you doing?\" Arix asked, disgusted.\n\"You said you wanted my impression of a bad guy. Don’t they always spit on the ground first?\" Drexel responded.\nArix thought for a moment and then nodded. \"Okay, keep going.\"\n\"Leave the women, kill all the men,\" Drexel said with a creepy grin.\n\"No way, we’re not bandits,\" Arix shook her head.\n\"Hand over your je jewelry or else!\" Drexel mimicked a throat-slitting gesture.\n\"That’s not right either, we’re not robbers,\" Arix rolled her eyes.\nDrexel scratched his head, finding this bad guy role harder than he thought.\nSuddenly, Drexel got another idea. He lifted his chin, looking down at Arix with disdain. \"You’re all garbage.\"\n\"That could work, but we’re only targeting the Dragon Clan. This might provoke everyone,\" Arix said, frowning with hesitation.\nDrexel fell silent. Suddenly, he realized that being the bad guy didn’t seem so easy.\nArix was feeling a bit deflated too. She had never tried being a bad guy before either.\n\"Hey, what are you two doing? It’s time to go into the school,\" Targon called out, noticing that the gate was open but the siblings were still hiding in a corner.\nHearing Targon’s voice, Arix and Drexel had a sudden flash of inspiration. In perfect sync, they said, \"ASK HIM!\"\nHaving made up their minds, Arix jumped into Drexel’s arms and cheerfully waved her hand at Targon. \"Coming!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 135: Pureblood of the Dragon Clan\nWhen they got to Targon, Drexel suddenly put an arm around Targon’s neck and whispered, \"Cousin Targon, do you know any way we can provoke the Dragon Clan? The more embarrassing, the better!\"\n\"Why do you want to know that? You’re not planning on doing something bad, are you?\" Targon looked at them suspiciously instead of answering right away.\nDrexel and Arix exchanged a guilty look, then both started shaking their heads frantically.\n\"No, no, we would never do anything bad,\" Drexel said, scratching the back of his head and smiling nervously.\n\"Exactly, we only do good things,\" Arix added, her eyes darting around nervously, unable to meet Targon’s gaze.\n\"Heh.\" Targon gave a cold laugh, clearly not believing them, but he didn’t push further. Instead, he pretended to talk to himself. \"I heard the Dragon Clan hates being called ’lizards.’ Not sure if that’s true, but you two definitely shouldn’t try it out.\"\n\"Got it,\" Drexel and Arix both said, their eyes lighting up at the same time. They exchanged excited glances and nodded enthusiastically. As for what Targon said afterward, they didn’t hear a word because they were too busy imagining the chaos they could cause.\nAfter that, the siblings followed Targon to the office to complete their exchange student procedures.\nWhen it was Drexel’s turn, the staff kept a cold, emotionless face throughout the process. But when it was Arix’s turn, the guy’s expression changed instantly to one of warmth and kindness.\n\"You’re Arix, right?\" the guy asked gently.\nArix blinked in confusion and nodded. \"Yes, sir.\"\n\"Since you’re also a therian, why not transfer to our Department of Chemistry here at the IRMA? It’s more suitable for you,\" the teacher said, looking at Arix like she was a precious herb being wasted in the wrong soil.\nArix caught on quickly and smiled apologetically. \"Sorry, sir, but I’m from the Alliance, so I won’t be transferring.\"\n\"Alright then. Your paperwork is complete. If you ever change your mind, you’re always welcome here,\" the teacher said, waving tiredly.\nSeeing this, the three of them wisely took their leave. Once outside the office, Targon finally let out the shock he had been holding in.\n\"Wow, Arix, do you know who that was?\" Targon asked, his mouth agape.\n\"Who?\" Arix glanced at Targon, not really interested.\nSeeing her nonchalant attitude, Targon decided to scare her a bit. He leaned in and whispered, \"That was Professor Fret, head of the Department of Chemistry and a Master Chemist.\"\n\"Oh, got it,\" Arix replied dismissively.\nTo Arix, the best Master Chemist would always be her granduncle. No other Master Chemist, no matter how skilled, could compare to him in her eyes.\nThinking of this, Arix suddenly missed Sims and wondered if he missed her too.\nSeeing Arix’s indifferent attitude, Targon decided to drop the subject.\nHe felt that continuing to boast would only embarrass himself. Especially with the ten psychic power healing potions in his Space Button—potions that even Master Fret couldn’t make—he figured it was best to stay quiet.\nSilently, Targon led Arix and Drexel towards the Grade 1, Class S at IRMA. As they walked, Drexel’s Hecaris Military Academy uniform drew a lot of attention from the Empire’s military students.\nMost of the looks they received were a mix of curiosity, disdain, and scorn, as if they were looking at some country bumpkins.\nArix noticed that nearly every student at IRMA carried an air of superiority, a kind of \"I’m noble, and you’re all beneath me\" attitude.\nThis haughty demeanor reminded Arix of the cadets at the Snorri Military Academy back at the training base, who were just as snobbish and had the same nose-in-the-air arrogance.\nIn the Empire, freshmen are split into five classes, with Class S being the cream of the crop and Class D scraping the bottom.\nIt was no wonder that exchange students landed in Class S. IRMA wants to show off their power and give those Alliance military students a not-so-subtle warning.\nAfter dropping the siblings at Class S, Targon headed back to his own sophomore Class S.\nWhen Drexel and Arix walked into Class S, they got mostly unfriendly stares, especially from the Dragon clan students who looked ready to pounce like hungry wolves.\nArix instantly put on a pitiful act, whining to Drexel in a cutesy voice, \"Drexel, look at that person! He’s not just mean but also... Okay, let’s be honest, he’s scaringly ugly.\"\nHer complaint echoed, making the classroom fall silent. The Dragon clan student she pointed at slammed his desk and stood up, glaring at Arix like he wanted to send her flying right then.\nDrexel raised an eyebrow, playing along with Arix’s act, and said to the Dragon clan student, \"Sorry, bro. My sister is still young and doesn’t know any better. You wouldn’t hold a grudge against a child, right?\"\n\"You—!\" Kares, the Dragon clan student, was about to lose it when the mentor at the front of the class coughed, stopping him.\n\"Alright, are we having a class or not? The two from the Alliance, come up and introduce yourselves,\" said Mentor Rennes, sounding pretty cold.\nRennes wasn’t exactly kind-hearted. If the president hadn’t told him to make sure the Tiger clan’s Alliance exchange students didn’t get a bad impression, he wouldn’t have stepped in even if Arix was about to get beaten up.\nArix and Drexel noticed this. They didn’t know why the mentor was a b it unfriendly to them, but as long as it didn’t mess with their plans, they were cool with it.\nThe siblings exchanged a look before Arix enthusiastically jumped onto the podium to introduce herself.\n\"Hi everyone, I’m Arix from the Hecaris Military Academy of the Alliance. I love mechas, and I want to pilot one of my own mecha some day in the future. Also, I’m an animal lover. My favorite animal? Lizards, of course!\" Arix said, sounding all naive.\nAs soon as she mentioned \"lizards\", the class’s attention shifted to the Dragon clan students. Sure enough, Siqi, the leader of the Dragon clan, couldn’t hold it in. He lashed out with a Supergiant-Class psychic power whip aimed right at Arix.\nThe students in Class S frowned but stayed indifferent, coldly watching it all unfold.\nArix’s lips curved into a triumphant smile as she thought to herself, \"Vita, Cupid, Sophia, counterattack! Make sure he’ll be in bed for the next six months.\"\n\"Got it!\" the trio responded excitedly.\nBut plans never go as expected. Suddenly, a psychic power barrier with a terrifying energy intercepted Arix’s attack.\nArix and Drexel both cursed inwardly, wondering who had ruined their plan. Their perfect opportunity slipped away like a bird taking flight.\nArix stared in disbelief at the barrier protecting her. Without it, Drexel would be the one lying on the ground.\nShe scanned Class S to identify who had sabotaged their plan and soon spotted Cassian, sitting in the back row, grinning at her like he wanted a pat on the back.\nArix sighed and facepalmed internally. It was obvious who the culprit was. She glanced at Cassian but kept quiet.\nKares, however, was less patient. He turned to Cassian, trying to keep his anger in check. \"Prince Cassian, isn’t this a bit too much?\"\n\"Too much?\" Cassian replied, feigning confusion. He stood up leisurely and walked towards the podium.\nAs he passed Kares, a powerful psychic pressure enveloped him.\nKares, veins bulging in pain from the psychic assault, was immobilized.\nCassian’s golden eyes bore into Kares as he said, \"I can do even more. If I catch you targeting Arix again, I swear by my title as the Crown Prince of the Empire, the Dragon clan’s purebloods will have a new leader by tomorrow.\"\nKares’s pupils contracted, and his body trembled. Ultimately, he sat down silently.\nCassian withdrew his psychic energy without giving Drexel another glance and continued to the podium.\nStanding in front of Arix, his golden eyes softened, and he called her name with gentle affection, \"Arix.\"\n\"Cassian, you really didn’t need to intervene. He couldn’t hurt me,\" Arix said with a hint of exasperation.\n\"Sorry, Arix, it was an instinctive reaction. I couldn’t help it,\" Cassian replied, spreading his hands innocently.\nSeeing Cassian’s expression of faux contrition, as if saying, \"I know it wasn’t right, but I’ll do it again,\" Arix could only indulge him.\nNoticing Arix’s silence, Cassian smirked and turned to Rennes. \"Sir, I’d like this new student to sit with me.\"\n\"Of course, Your Highness,\" Mentor Rennes agreed immediately, bowing respectfully in the Empire’s fashion.\nAfter returning the gesture, Cassian led Arix to the back row. The two of them walked off together, completely forgetting about Drexel.\nDrexel rolled his eyes, accustomed to the routine. As long as his sister was around, he always seemed to turn invisible.\nRennes hadn’t forgotten about Drexel. With a wary look, he addressed him, \"Please introduce yourself, properly.\"\nDrexel felt wronged; he hadn’t even done anything yet.\nPouting slightly, he stepped to the front. Then he glanced around at the students, and began his introduction, \"Hello, everyone. I’m Drexel, the top freshman from the Department of Combat at the Alliance’s Hecaris Military Academy. Today, I’m going to challenge the pureblood cub of the Empire’s Dragon clan. If I lose, you can do whatever you want with me. But if I win, the Dragon clan must apologize.\"\nHis declaration sparked an immediate uproar. The students recalled the recent scandal where the Dragon clan had forcefully transferred a student from another military school.\nRealizing this, the students grew even more excited. All eyes turned to the Dragon clan’s pureblood, eagerly awaiting his response.",

      "content": "Chapter 136: Battlefield\nKares sneered but then noticed something odd. He glanced at Cassian and saw the prince remaining calm.\nOnly then did Kares let out a breath of relief. Turning back to Drexel, he continued his taunts. \"Really? You think you can challenge the Dragon clan? If you’re so eager to get yourself embarrassed, I’ll oblige. See you at the training ground.\"\n\"Alright, it’s a deal,\" Drexel replied, satisfied with the outcome. He turned to Rennes and said, \"Sir, that’s all for my introduction.\"\nRennes was speechless. A student arranging a fight during self-introductions? It had been years since he’d seen such a troublemaker.\nThankfully, Drexel would be here for just a week. Rennes decided it was best to ignore it.\nRubbing his temples in frustration, he pointed to the farthest corner of the classroom, \"You’ll sit there for this week.\"\n\"Okay, sir,\" Drexel nodded, looking innocent and harmless.\nShaking his head, Rennes addressed the rest of the students, \"Since we have a duel scheduled, today’s lesson will be practical training. Get up and follow me to the training ground.\"\nHearing this, Arix glanced worriedly at Drexel.\nThe Dragon clan’s pureblood, Kares, his psychic power was Supergiant-Class, but he could achieve Supergiant+ in physical power when in his beast form. This put him a rank above Drexel.\nSensing Arix’s worry, Drexel gave her an ’OK’ hand gesture with a smile. Then he turned back to continue his snarky exchange with Kares as they left the classroom.\n\"Arix, are you worried about your brother?\" Cassian looked down at the little tiger in his arms and noticed her tightly folded wings, a sign of her nervousness and fear.\n\"Yes, I’m afraid Drexel will lose and get hurt,\" Arix replied, her tone somber.\n\"Arix, you should have more faith in him. Sometimes, even I can’t beat him,\" Cassian said sincerely. Arix knew he was just trying to comfort her, since it was clear who was stronger: Cassian having both psychic and physical power at Supergiant+, versus Drexel with both at just Supergiant-Class.\nEven though she believed it was a kind lie, it still warmed Arix’s heart. She smiled and said, \"Alright, no need to comfort me. Let’s go, we need to cheer for Drexel!\"\n\"Okay.\" Cassian didn’t explain further, just smiled indulgently and carried Arix towards the training ground.\nAs soon as Arix and Cassian stepped into the training ground, they saw Drexel and Kares already in the dimensional battlefield, ready to duel.\nThe dimensional battlefield, as its name suggests, was a huge arena created using spatial technology. From the outside, it seemed small, but inside, it expanded to an enormous size.\nBecause of this, the dimensional battlefield was the go-to spot for students to settle scores or train. It allowed them to fight without worrying about damaging public property or being constrained by space.\nOutside the battlefield, students from Class S and curious onlookers had gathered to watch. Even other classes on the training ground paused to see the action.\nSoon, all the teachers and students in the area focused on the battlefield.\nThe excitement grew when they realized one of the fighters was an exchange student from the Alliance and the other a pureblood from the Dragon clan. Many recorded the event with their opticomputers and posted it on IRMA’s campus network with eye-catching titles:\n\"Shocking! A Revenge Duel by an Exchange Student from the Alliance’s Hecaris Military Academy!\"\n\"A Grumpy Exchange Student! Dares to Challenge the Strongest Newcomer from the Dragon Clan?’\"\n\"Alliance Military Student Drexel vs. IRMA’s Kares – Who Will Win? Stay Tuned!\"\nThese posts quickly soared to the top of IRMA’s trending list, with comments flooding in at lightning speed:\nThornBush: \"Wow, did I read that right? This year’s exchange student from the Alliance has some guts!\"\nQuirkyQuokka: \"Didn’t the Dragon clan exchange students insulted the Hecaris before? They switched to the Alliance’s Koros Military Academy. I think anyone whose school was insulted like that would seek revenge against the Dragon clan. Still, I doubt the Alliance student will win.\")\n(Sparrow258: \"Right! There’s nothing much to see. I bet the Alliance student will definitely lose.\")\n(MeowingKitty: \"I’ll bet a lizard on it, LMAO.\")\n(GalacticGuppy: \"Hey, what’s the deal with the lizard joke? Can someone explain it to me?\")\n(Raccoooon: \"It’s because the Dragon clan’s bloodline has mixed so much that many of them look like lizards. Calling them lizards is like a stronger insult, implying they’re mongrels.\")\n(ZenZebra: \"LOL! No wonder the Dragon clan members go crazy when they hear ’lizard’! Haha!\")\n(NeonNarwhal: \"Hey, did you notice this year’s exchange student from the Alliance is pretty good-looking? I wonder if he’s open to interracial dating, ’cause I’m thinking of pursuing him.\")\n(LittleGoldfish: \"Uh, pretty sure he wouldn’t care much about the interracial thing, but... are you sure he’d be open to dating a guy?\")\n...\nThe comments continued to roll in.\nThe campus network buzzed with activity, and the training ground was alive with gossip.\nArix listened to the crowd, which mostly cheered for Kares from the Dragon clan. Frustrated, she took a deep breath and shouted, \"Drexel! Go for it! HMA will win! The lizard will lose!!!\"\nAt first, her cheer blended into the background noise, just another voice supporting the Alliance military student. But when the last part hit their ears, every student in the training ground, even the mentors, gasped.\nCalling out the Dragon clan so openly was beyond bold—it was almost a declaration of war. The entire training ground fell silent for a moment, everyone processing Arix’s words.\nCassian looked at Arix with wide eyes, a mix of admiration and worry. \"Arix, that was... intense.\"\nArix puffed out her chest. \"Someone had to say it.\"\nMeanwhile, Drexel glanced over at Arix, a smirk forming on his lips. He gave her a quick thumbs-up before turning his full attention back to Kares, who was now seething with rage.\nKares’ eyes blazed. \"You dare insult the Dragon clan? You’ll pay for that.\"\nDrexel just shrugged, a calm smile on his face. \"Guess we’ll see about that.\"\nThe tension in the training ground was palpable as the duel was about to begin, with everyone holding their breath in anticipation.",

      "content": "Chapter 137: A Fierce Fight\nWhen someone called them \"lizards,\" any Dragon clan member with an ounce of pride wouldn’t let that slide.\nRight on cue, every Dragon clan student in the room zeroed in on the young cub with icy glares. Their anger was almost visible, thickening the air around them.\nBut before they could react, an intense psychic power wrapped around them. It was Prince Cassian of the Empire, his glare full of menace.\nOnly then did the Dragon clan students realize the cub was in the hands of His Highness Cassian. The shock made them go silent instantly.\nThe leading Dragon clan students exchanged looks and quickly sent a message to their pureblood, asking for instructions.\nOn the battlefield, Kares, who was about to start a fight, nearly choked when he saw the message on his opticomputer. With a mix of frustration and resignation, he gritted his teeth and said to Drexel, \"Tell your sister to stop calling us ’lizards.’ In return, I’ll make those two Dragon clan exchange students apologize to the Hecaris Military Academy. Otherwise, the Dragon clan won’t let you off.\"\n’A deal like this?’\nDrexel raised an eyebrow and agreed, sending a quick message to his sister.\n\"Arix, Kares agreed to have those two exchange students apologize. You can hold off on the insults for now.\"\nArix replied swiftly. \"Okay.\"\nSeeing his sister’s message, Drexel smiled slightly. He just had one more thing to handle.\nThinking about it, Drexel looked up at Kares, his usually innocent eyes now fierce and ready for battle.\nKares’ gaze turned cold. He couldn’t touch Arix, but he was determined to make the one in front of him pay.\nTheir energy flared up at the same time. The intense pressure even made Rennes, the referee, frown.\nRennes sighed inwardly, regretting not rejecting the president’s decision to put those two Alliance exchange students in Class S. If he had, they wouldn’t be in this mess. But it was too late for regrets.\nRennes closed his eyes, took a deep breath. Then he abruptly opened them and shouted, \"Ready—\"\nDrexel’s eyes were sharp, and a surge of powerful psychic energy radiated from him. Slowly, an ice-blue spear formed in his hand.\nSeeing this, Kares’ eyes narrowed with seriousness. He stopped taking things lightly and immediately shifted into his beast form.\nKares’ beast form was an awe-inspiring dragon, stretching about ten meters in length.\nHis body was armored with tough scales. Sharp, conical teeth lined his mouth. His large, round eyes scanned his surroundings.\nHe had a powerful tail, strong limbs. Though his wings were ridiculously small, almost laughable, his presence was still imposing.\nWhen Kares transformed, everyone watching gasped in awe. This was the closest they had ever come to seeing a real dragon, and they were thrilled at their luck to witness it today.\nThe crowd, caught between terror and excitement, scrambled for their opticomputers to record or livestream the event. Arix, seeing Kares’ beast form, watched the battlefield with rising anxiety, not daring to look away.\n\"Come on!\" Arix thought, clutching her paws tightly and silently praying.\nIn the dimension battlefield, Rennes raised his right hand and swung it down sharply, shouting, \"Fight!\"\nAt the word, Drexel sprang forward like a bolt of lightning, his ice-blue spear gleaming menacingly like the scythe of death.\nKares moved too, his thick tail whipping toward Drexel like a colossal lash.\nDrexel, facing the incoming attack, planted his spear into the ground and launched himself into the air, skillfully avoiding Kares’ strike. Twisting mid-air, he aimed his spear straight for Kares’ throat.\nUnfazed, Kares reached out with one claw for Drexel and the other for the spear.\nDrexel, eyes narrowed, dodged the claw, continuing his relentless spear assault. Each thrust was swift and ruthless, the spear slicing through the air with terrifying precision.\nDespite Drexel’s speed and ferocity, Kares’ Supergiant+ physical power and tough scales withstood the assault. Drexel’s spear could only leave marks on the scales, failing to break through and cause significant damage.\nDetermined, Drexel poured more psychic power into his spear, making it colder and sharper.\nKares’ expression grew serious as Drexel managed to cut a gash on his left arm.\nBreathing heavily from the exertion, Drexel smiled at the sight of the wound. He intensified his attacks, his spear movements growing even more vicious and rapid.\nUnder Drexel’s relentless onslaught, Kares’ body soon bore numerous wounds of various sizes.\nHowever, Drexel’s own condition wasn’t any better. The ferocity of his attacks was taking its toll.\nBecause of his relentless offense, Drexel’s defense was weak, and although he dodged as best he could, Kares’ claws still managed to pierce him in several places, leaving bloody holes.\nYet, at this point, both fighters were in a frenzy, completely ignoring their injuries. They focused solely on defeating each other.\nTheir intense battle turned the dimension battlefield into a gruesome scene.\nBlood and scales rained down like a storm, creating pools of blood and scattered scales on the ground. The sight of flesh-laden scales and large bloodstains shocked the spectators outside the battlefield.\nThe students of Class S, in particular, were horrified. They swallowed nervously as they watched the brutal fight.\nOne single thought now occupied all their minds: This year, they must avoid provoking the Alliance exchange students. Drexel, just like Kares, was a maniacal fighter!\nEver since Drexel got injured, Arix’s eyes had been red, fixed on the dimensional battlefield.\nAs the ground filled with more blood and scales, the sight of the glaring red made Arix’s heart feel like it was being stabbed repeatedly, causing an instant, wrenching pain.\nThe intense pain made the light in her eyes gradually fade, turning into confusion.\nIn the end, her eyes were vacant, staring blankly at the battlefield, her mouth mumbling unconsciously, \"Drexel... stop fighting... stop... stop...\"\nThe deafening noise around them drowned out Arix’s whispers, so no one noticed her condition.\nCassian, worried that the scene would overwhelm Arix, reached out to cover her eyes and finally noticed something was wrong.\n\"Arix?\" Cassian realized that Arix didn’t react at all when he covered her eyes, instantly sensing that something was off.\n\"Arix! What’s wrong!\" Cassian picked Arix up and saw her vacant eyes.\n\"Arix! Can you hear me?\"\n\"Arix, wake up!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 138: Arix Rampaged\n\"Stop... stop...\" Arix mumbled unconsciously, unable to hear Cassian’s calls. Her mind seemed trapped in a dark, silent room.\nLarge drops of blood began to fall from the sky, splattering on the floor. The sight of the blood red made Arix’s eyes snap open.\nShe looked up at the sky, seeing Drexel’s heavily injured state.\n\"Drexel! Nooo!\" Arix’s emotions collapsed, and her Supergiant+ psychic power exploded, sweeping out like a shockwave.\nThe nearby students, unaware of what was happening, were blasted dozens of meters away by the terrifying psychic power, only stopping when they hit the walls.\n\"Ugh!\" The training ground was filled with the sounds of countless people coughing up blood.\nIRMA’s mentors, despite being injured, immediately stood up and shouted, \"Get out of the training ground! Someone’s psychic power is out of control!\"\n\"Hurry, go! The Alliance exchange student’s psychic power is out of control!\"\n\"Oh my God! Run!!!\"\n\"Drexel is crazy, and so is his sister! This year’s Alliance exchange students are cursed!\"\nThe training ground turned into chaos, with people running for their lives or making sarcastic comments.\nSome fearless ones even took out their opticomputers to record videos and upload them to the campus network.\nThe instant Arix’s psychic power rampage hit, the campus network went wild. The buzz over these posts even eclipsed the earlier excitement about Drexel and Kares’ battle.\n\"Terrifying! Alliance exchange student loses control, hurts all teachers and students present!\"\n\"Suspected Supergiant+ psychic power from the Alliance exchange student!\"\n\"Nightmare day at IRMA! The insane Alliance exchange student!\"\nThe comment sections were on fire too.\nLuckyKoi: \"Demolishing the Empires best military academy? Nice try, Alliance people!\"\nQuakqook: \"What’s going on? Why did the exchange student suddenly have a psychic power rampage?\"\nPinkbear: \"I was there! It’s probably because her brother got beaten too badly.\"\nRaccoooon: \"Was Kares that brutal?\"\nPinkbear: \"No... Kares got beaten up pretty badly too... you should have seen the battlefield, it was covered in his scales... but the saddest part is he doesn’t have a sister to feel sorry for him.\"\nPinkbear: \"Pfft! Hahaha! Don’t twist the knife with your words.\"\nBack at the training ground, the only ones left were a few mentors. They were anxiously watching the rampaging Arix.\nArix’s initial psychic outburst caught Cassian off guard and injured many Empire military students. Luckily, he soon managed to contain the rest of her rampage with his own psychic power barrier.\n\"Arix! Wake up!\" Cassian was pouring out psychic power while trying to wake Arix.\n\"Drexel...\" Arix mumbled, her mind fixated on entering the dimensional battlefield to save her brother and kill the dragon attacking him. The thought of that dragon only fueled her stress, making her attacks on the psychic barrier even stronger.\nCassian’s psychic power barrier, while temporarily containing Arix, was under immense strain, nearly breaking multiple times. He didn’t want to harm Arix, so he held back from forcefully suppressing her, and instead, he reinforced the barrier constantly, trying to figure out what to do next.\n\"Your Highness! What should we do?\" The mentors, whose psychic power levels were insufficient, could only watch helplessly.\n\"Go to the dimensional battlefield and stop the fight. Get Drexel here immediately,\" Cassian quickly ordered. He understood what caused Arix’s rampage.\n\"Got it, got it!\" The mentor quickly caught on to Cassian’s plan. Arix’s rampage was clearly triggered by her brother’s injury.\nWith this in mind, the mentor hurriedly used their opticomputer to contact Rennes, instructing him to immediately halt the match and bring Drexel over.\nRennes, having just received the urgent message, felt his head spinning.\nHe looked at Drexel, who had torn into Kares so fiercely that the ground was littered with scales.\nThinking about Arix outside, apparently causing her own kind of havoc, made Rennes feel even more dizzy.\nWithout wasting any time, he used his referee authority to separate the still-battling pair.\nThe two were still caught up in their frenzy. The sudden end to the fight left both combatants glaring at Rennes with murderous intent.\n\"Today’s match is over. Arix is in trouble, and you need to...\" Rennes hadn’t even finished his sentence when Drexel disappeared on the spot.\nOnce the chaos of today was over, he was definitely going to have a talk with the president about reassigning these two Alliance exchange students. Otherwise, he wasn’t sure if he’d survive the week!\n...\nOn the training ground...\nDrexel, drenched in blood, bolted over from the dimensional battlefield. The first thing he saw was his sister, Arix, pounding on a psychic power barrier, seemingly oblivious to everything around her.\n\"Arix!\" Drexel shouted, his voice laced with worry.\nAt the sound of her brother’s voice, Arix halted her attack. The psychic energy enveloping her started to settle down.\nCassian, noticing this, began to relax. But then Kares emerged from the dimensional battlefield.\n\"What happened? Where is everyone?\" Kares asked, confusion etched on his face as he scanned the deserted training ground.\n\"Uh-oh!\" Cassian’s eyes widened in alarm. Before he could move, Arix shattered the psychic power barrier and charged straight at Kares.\n\"Watch out!\" Cassian shouted, panic in his voice.\n\"Arix!\" Drexel echoed, eyes filled with concern for his sister.\nKares, hearing the commotion, turned to face them. He barely had time to register the sight of Arix flying at him before her fierce psychic power slammed into him.\n\"Ugh...!\"\nBlood sprayed from Kares’s mouth as he was hurled against the wall like a rag doll.\nCrumpling to the ground, Kares coughed and spat blood, terror filling his eyes as Arix prepared to strike again. It was bad enough dealing with her brother, but Arix was a psychic-powered Supergiant!\n\"Help!\" Kares yelled, desperate for assistance against the unstoppable force.\nThe nearby mentors hesitated, but Cassian intervened.\n\"No need!\" Cassian said quickly.\n\"But Kares...\" one mentor began, concerned as Kares took another blow.\n\"He’ll be fine. He won’t die,\" Cassian reassured, relaxing as if he’d figured something out. He exchanged a knowing glance with Drexel, and the two of them simply watched.\n\"Drexel, what are you doing? Do something! Stop your sister!\" Kares said as he dodged another attack. He looked pleadingly at them, only to see Cassian and Drexel observing like it was entertainment.\n\"My sister? She’s fine,\" Drexel replied innocently, glancing at Arix. She seemed a bit ruffled but otherwise okay.\n\"Of course your sister is fine, but can’t you see I’m in trouble?!\" Kares’s patience snapped.\n\"Oh, you’re in trouble?\" Drexel asked. He feigned sudden realization, covering his mouth in mock surprise.\nKares was about to breathe a sigh of relief, thinking Drexel finally understood, but Drexel’s next words angered him even more.\n\"But you’re not my sister. Why should I care if you’re in trouble?\" Drexel asked seriously, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.\n\"You guys!\" Kares barely managed to shout before Arix’s psychic power blasted him again.\nFor several more minutes, Kares endured a relentless barrage, his face swelling until he looked unrecognizable.\n\"Alright, alright! What do you want? Just tell me already!\" Kares finally broke down, his spirit crushed.\nDrexel’s lips curled into a smile. Leisurely, he said, \"Can the Dragon clan apologize to HMA now?\"\n\"Yes, yes!\" Kares agreed instantly, desperate for the onslaught to end.\n\"And about that last fight, who won? You or me?\" Drexel’s eyes sparkled with amusement.\n\"You won!\" Kares spat out the words, gritting his teeth in frustration.\n\"And today’s damages, who’s going to pay for them?\" Drexel asked, chuckling softly.\n\"I’ll pay! I’ll pay! Happy now?\" Kares glared at Drexel, trembling with rage.\nNever in his life had he met siblings as shameless as these two!\nSeeing Kares’s pitiful state, even Drexel felt a twinge of guilt. He quickly ran over and hugged Arix, stopping her from attacking further.\n\"Arix, that’s enough. No more fighting,\" Drexel gently comforted her, holding her tightly.\nAmazingly, Arix seemed to calm down, her anger dissipating.\nKares sighed in relief, feeling safe at last.\nWith the situation under control, Drexel was internally delighted but outwardly feigned annoyance. \"See? If you had agreed earlier, none of this would have happened. You youngsters, always making things difficult.\"\nKares, unable to take it anymore, coughed up blood and fainted, overwhelmed by the siblings’ antics.\nDrexel swallowed what he was going to say and sighed.\n’Wow, Kares is really sensitive.’\nArix, still in Drexel’s arms, looked dazedly at the unconscious Kares. She turned to Drexel, her eyes clear. She had regained her senses earlier but had pretended to be out of control to help her brother get revenge.\nBut now, she started to wonder if they had gone too far today.",

      "content": "Chapter 139: Punishment\nThe siblings stared at each other in silence until they heard a voice exclaim with joy.\n\"The president is here!\" The remaining mentors shouted in excitement.\nBoth Arix and Drexel froze. Drexel reacted first and whispered urgently to Arix, \"Arix, pretend to faint, quick!\"\n\"Oh, oh,\" Arix wasn’t dumb. She immediately tilted her head and pretended to faint convincingly.\nSeeing Arix’s performance, Drexel breathed a sigh of relief. Then, he loudly cried out, \"Arix, are you okay? If something happens to you, how can I live with that?\"\n\"Waaah, my poor sister!\" Drexel cried as he shook Arix gently, acting like he was trying to wake her up.\nThe sight of the unconscious cub, Drexel covered in blood, and his heartfelt crying was enough to tug at anyone’s heartstrings. It was a scene so tragic it could bring anyone who saw it to tears.\nDerick, the president, had just arrived. He was bewildered by the sight of Kares unconscious on the ground and the Alliance exchange student crying miserably. He couldn’t quite tell who the real victim was.\nCassian, who had witnessed everything, silently raised his hand to cover his mouth, hiding a smirk.\n...\nIn the IRMA president’s office, President Deric felt the tension crackling like a storm.\nOn his left, the Dragon clan leader wore a dark scowl.\nTo his right, the Tiger clan leader maintained a relentless smile.\nDeric sighed, rubbing his temples to fend off the headache brewing.\n\"They can’t just hurt my son without bearing any consequence. Arix must be punished,\" growled Ignathor, the Dragon clan leader, his eyes glinting dangerously.\nKrylak, the Tiger clan leader, immediately fired back. \"Why should Arix be punished? If your son Kares hadn’t hit her so hard, Arix’s psychic powers wouldn’t have spiraled out of control.\"\n\"Huh, so it’s my son’s fault he got injured?\" Ignathor sneered, his anger bubbling over.\n\"That’s not what I meant. Kids fight, they get hurt—it’s normal. No need to blow this out of proportion,\" Krylak said, though guilt tinged his voice.\n\"But did Arix get hurt? My son is the one who’s badly injured!\" Ignathor’s glare was intense, cutting through Krylak’s bravado.\n\"Arix is hurt too! She’s at home, unconscious, probably with serious internal injuries. Just because you can’t see the damage doesn’t mean it’s not there,\" Krylak shot back, his frustration mounting.\nThe heated argument dragged on, neither side backing down. Finally, they turned to President Deric for a decision.\n\"President Deric, what do you say? I expect a satisfactory answer,\" Ignathor demanded, his tone cold and menacing.\n\"Mr. President, we need to handle this fairly. We can’t punish a nice kid,\" Krylak added, his voice firm.\nCaught in the crossfire, Deric took a deep breath and stood. Bowing slightly to Ignathor, he began, \"I’m very sorry your son was hurt at school. We will cover all medical expenses and provide compensation for mental distress. I hope this satisfies you.\"\nIgnathor, somewhat placated, pressed on, \"And what about Arix’s punishment?\"\n\"Mr. Ignathor, I’m sorry, but since Arix isn’t a student here, we can’t punish her. However, we will terminate the exchange program,\" Deric said, regret evident in his voice. Losing Arix was tough, but student safety came first.\n\"Just terminating the program? That’s it? My son’s injuries mean nothing?\" Ignathor’s dissatisfaction was palpable, especially with his son still healing.\n\"I’m very sorry. With the program terminated, Arix is no longer our responsibility. You can take this matter up with her parents,\" Deric replied, deftly shifting the burden.\nIgnathor had no choice but to glare at Krylak.\n\"Don’t look at me like that. I’m not Arix’s custodian,\" Krylak said, spreading his hands and shaking his head.\n\"Then who is her custodian?\" Ignathor’s voice was cold, clearly showing he wasn’t planning to let this go easily.\n\"Her custodian? Well, it depends. Do you want the ones from the Empire or the Alliance?\" Krylak’s tone was conflicted.\n\"The Empire,\" Ignathor decided, thinking it was closer.\n\"Oh, then you need to go to the Moon Goddess Temple and find the Pontifex. He’s her grandfather,\" Krylak said nonchalantly.\n\"Bang!\"\nIgnathor slammed the table in anger, thinking Krylak was messing with him. \"Krylak! Are you joking with me?\"\nThe Pontifex? Even Alpha Leonidas wouldn’t easily offend him!\n\"Ignathor, you can check it out yourself. Arix really is the Pontifex’s granddaughter. I’m not making this up,\" Krylak said, feeling wronged.\n\"I can confirm that Arix is indeed the Pontifex’s granddaughter,\" President Deric quickly interjected, trying to prevent another argument.\nIgnathor was momentarily stunned, not daring to offend the Pontifex. He shifted his approach, \"Then what about the Alliance?\"\n\"The Fifth Legion Admiral Matis is her grandfather too, and I wouldn’t suggest you go to him. The big families in the Alliance are fiercely protective of their own,\" Krylak said, kindly advising him.\nThis time, Ignathor didn’t immediately get angry. Instead, he looked at President Deric.\nPresident Deric nodded in agreement. Then, he remembered something and hesitantly added, \"Also, Alpha Leonidas and Luna Amethyst have vouched for Arix.\"\nThe implication was clear: pursuing this further would mean offending both Alpha Leonidas and Luna Amethyst.\nHearing these names, Ignathor’s expression finally changed. His face turned various shades of red and purple before he grudgingly said, \"In that case, the Dragon clan will not pursue this matter further.\"\nWith that, he stood up and left the president’s office without another word.\nKrylak couldn’t help but laugh but felt it would be impolite, so he coughed and said to President Deric, \"If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave.\"\nIt wouldn’t be polite to laugh here; he’d save it for when he got home.\nDeric, feeling exhausted, rubbed his temples and said dismissively, \"See you around then. Need me to walk you out?\"\n\"No need, but thanks,\" Krylak said cheerfully. He left the office humming a tune.\nFinally, with the two troublemakers gone, President Deric could relax a bit. He thought for a moment and then decided to open the opticomputer. He posted a new announcement on the Imperial Royal Military Academy’s website.\nIRMA OFFICIAL:\nDue to special circumstances, the school will not accept exchange students from the Alliance for the next four years.\nAfter posting the announcement, Deric felt like the sky was bluer and the air was fresher. The reason for the four-year ban was simple: once Arix graduated from the military academy, she would no longer be eligible to become an exchange student.\nFeeling pleased with himself, Deric gave himself a mental pat on the back.\nArix was an excellent student, no doubt about it. Any school lucky enough to have her would be truly blessed. But in the end, Arix wasn’t a student of IRMA. No matter how much IRMA did for her, it was ultimately taking care of someone else’s student.\nAnd with her tendency to cause trouble, there was no guarantee IRMA would even have a future if she stayed. So, this \"blessing\" was better off given to someone else; IRMA didn’t need it.\nDeric, now more relaxed, let out a deep breath. The tension of the past few days seemed to lift as he settled back into his chair. He felt a rare moment of peace in his often chaotic role as president.",

      "content": "Chapter 140: Sneaking Out\nEver since Arix and Drexel caused a disturbance at IRMA and gave Kares a solid beating, Krylak had kept them on lockdown to prevent any Dragon clan retaliation.\nFor twenty long days, they stayed within their clan’s territory, dutifully attending online classes.\nToo much idle time, however, makes people restless.\n\"Arix, aren’t you bored?\" Drexel asked, sprawled out on the desk.\n\"What do you think? It’s been almost 20 days, and we haven’t been out for fun,\" Arix replied, looking like a deflated little tiger on the verge of a tantrum.\n\"When will these days end?\" Drexel pouted, balancing a pen on his lips.\n\"Uncle Krylak said he’d let us out before the Blessing Ceremony. But it’s only five days away, and we’re still stuck here,\" Arix complained, feeling like Krylak was breaking his promise.\n\"Adults never keep their promises,\" Drexel sighed, letting the pen drop from his lips in frustration.\n\"And now with Scion out on a mission, it’s even worse.\" Arix had tolerated the confinement because she could visit Scion every day. But with him away, the boredom was unbearable.\nDrexel rolled his eyes at Arix’s complaint. Her obsession with Scion’s looks was something he couldn’t understand. Thank goodness Arix was a girl—if she were a boy, she’d be the spitting image of the Calix family’s son, surrounded by illegitimate kids.\nHowever, it suddenly came to Drexel that being called \"uncle\" by a bunch of kids didn’t seem so bad after all.\nDrexel chuckled to himself, lost in his thoughts.\nArix shot Drexel a deadpan look, wondering if he had finally snapped from being locked up. His creepy laughter dragged on, making Arix’s forehead twitch. She held back her temper until she couldn’t anymore and threw a pen at Drexel.\n\"Have you laughed enough? What’s so funny?\" Arix asked, clearly annoyed.\nDrexel dodged the pen, but he dared not reveal his thoughts. If he did, the next thing flying at him might be Arix’s knife.\n\"Ahem, isn’t it almost time to return to the Alliance? I was just thinking about the famous Moon Goddess Temple in the Empire—we haven’t visited it yet!\" Drexel coughed, quickly changing the subject.\nArix just snorted, \"We can’t go out anyway, so what’s the point in thinking about it?\"\nDrexel raised an eyebrow, a mischievous grin spreading across his face. \"I have a way. It just depends on whether you wants to go out or not.\"\n\"What way?\" Arix asked, curiosity and suspicion battling within her.\nDrexel’s face lit up with a big, smug grin as he said, \"Come on, follow me. I’m taking you out for fun.\"\nArix had a bad feeling about this but couldn’t resist the curiosity, so she followed him.\nA few minutes later, they arrived at a secluded corner of the family estate.\n\"Drexel, don’t tell me this is your way out!\" Arix’s paw trembled as she pointed to a tiny dog door about ten centimeters high.\nWhenever she was with Drexel, they always managed to hit new lows. Like now, he wanted her, a proud young tiger, to crawl through a dog hole!\n\"Shh, Arix, keep it down,\" Drexel whispered urgently, covering her mouth with his hand and putting a finger to his lips. After making sure no one was around, he relaxed a bit.\n\"It may look like an ordinary dog door, but it’s the only blind spot for the clan’s surveillance radars. I spent days figuring this out,\" Drexel explained proudly, keeping his voice low.\nArix rolled her eyes.\n’No matter how he puts it, it’s still a dog hole!’\n\"I’m not going. I’d rather just ask Uncle Krylak and go out openly,\" Arix said, shaking her head and taking a step back, her whole body radiating resistance.\n\"Sure, we could go out openly, but we can’t exactly visit the Moon Goddess Temple openly. Since we have to sneak there anyway, we might as well start sneaking now. If we get caught by the Moon Goddess Temple folks, we can at least say we had no ill intentions,\" Drexel reasoned.\nArix couldn’t deny that her brother had a knack for strategy. Even his exit plans were well thought out.\nSighing, she looked at the dog door, struggling internally for a moment before hesitating again.\n\"Come on, just get out quickly. The hole’s too small; I still need to make it bigger to get out myself,\" Drexel said impatiently, rolling his eyes and lifting Arix through the hole first.\nThen he started tearing at the wall to enlarge the hole enough for him to squeeze through.\nArix, now outside, watched Drexel struggle to wiggle through the hole. The sight was quite unappealing.\n\"Why not make the hole a bit bigger?\" she asked.\n\"You don’t get it. This way, we save materials for patching it up later. If we make it too big, it’ll be harder to hide. Oh crap! My waist is stuck. Arix, give me a hand!\" Drexel groaned, hands on the ground, trying to pull his waist through.\nReminding herself that this was her brother, Arix gritted her teeth and grabbed his shirt, pulling with all her might.\nWith a thud, Drexel’s waist finally came free.\nHe grimaced as he got up, rubbing his waist. \"I guess next time I won’t skimp on making the hole bigger. The time wasted here could’ve filled two dog holes.\"\nArix, not wanting to waste time on this silly topic, quickly interrupted, \"Alright, just find something to cover the hole, and let’s get going.\"\n\"Got it,\" Drexel replied, brushing the dirt off his clothes. In the dim alleyway, he found two broken baskets and used them to cover the dog hole.\nSatisfied with the makeshift cover, Drexel grinned and then picked up Arix, heading out of the alley.\nStepping out of the alley, Arix and Drexel found themselves amidst the bustling streets of Imperial Nexus. They wandered, eyes wide with wonder, as if they’d never seen anything like it.\nIt wasn’t that walking around was unusual; it was the stark contrast between the streets of the Alliance and those of the Empire that held their fascination.\nIn the Alliance, street vending was mostly banned, with robots patrolling to keep illegal vendors at bay. But here, in the Empire, robots were a rare sight. Instead, therian folk managed everything themselves, giving the streets a unique, almost otherworldly charm.\nStreet vending thrived in the Empire, with few restrictions. Therians set up stalls everywhere, selling strange items from their travels to dangerous places. These exotic goods attracted more interest than usual, making business brisk.\n\"Check it out! Insectoid Cores, anything you want, I have it all!\"\n\"Hey kid, want to be a mecha master overnight? Buy this guide! Seven days or your money back!\"\n\"Fresh beast meat, ten credits a kilo! First come, first served!\"\nArix clung to her brother, eyes darting around in excitement. She often pulled him to her favorite stalls for a closer look.\n\"Arix, why do you like these little trinkets? They all look like junk,\" Drexel finally said, watching her rummage through a pile of odds and ends.\n\"Well, you shouldn’t buy that ’mecha master in seven days’ guide either!\" Arix shot back, equally disdainful.\n\"That’s different! What if it’s a real master’s guide?\" Drexel argued, pulling out the guide he’d just bought and flipping through it. He couldn’t understand it, but it looked impressive.\nArix rolled her eyes and resumed her treasure hunt. Just as Drexel believed he might find a secret master’s guide, Arix was convinced she could stumble upon a hidden gem.\n’Aren’t these stalls where lucky finds often occurred in novels?’\nEven if there were no treasures, the quirky items were fascinating.\nArix found some little pearl—it was so smooth! It would make a great gift for Cirilla.\nThese medicinal ingredients looked good too; they might be a nice present for Varden.\nThen she found a piece of stone. She wasn’t sure what this stone was for, but it was pretty and might be worth keeping.\nArix spent quite a while picking out items, satisfied with her purchases. After paying, she nestled back into her Drexel’s embrace, and they continued exploring.",

      "content": "Chapter 141: The Moon Goddess Temple\nAs they wandered, Arix’s eyes suddenly lit up when she spotted a particular restaurant.\n\"Hey, wait, Drexel! Let’s go eat there!\" she exclaimed, pointing excitedly at the place.\n\"It’s not even lunchtime yet. What do you want to eat now...\" Drexel trailed off as he followed her gaze. A cute cat-eared maid was enticing customers, while a wolf-eared butler showed off his abs.\nDrexel almost stared his eyes out.\n\"Arix, if I take you to a place like this, guess what Mom and Dad will do to me,\" Drexel said, giving her a ’don’t even think about it’ look.\n\"Why should you be scared of them? You are taking me to the Moon Goddess Temple, and you aren’t afraid,\" Arix retorted, pouting.\n\"Well, you have to choose: the Moon Goddess Temple or this restaurant,\" Drexel replied, deadpan.\n\"Alright, the Moon Goddess Shrine it is,\" Arix finally decided, though she was clearly reluctant.\nIt wasn’t that the restaurant wasn’t appealing, but the Moon Goddess Temple had someone she wanted to meet. As for those handsome boys and pretty girls, she figured there would be another chance.\nDrexel watched Arix’s lingering gaze, too tired to say anything. ’\nWhose genes did Arix inherit to be such a sucker for good looks? Thank God she isn’t a boy; otherwise, who knows how many girls she’d trouble.’\nBut on second thought, Drexel found that a girl like this might be even more problematic.\n’What if Arix gets swayed by a handsome guy and ends up in danger?’\nAs Drexel was lost in his worrying thoughts, Arix asked casually, \"Why do you want to go to the Moon Goddess Temple anyway?\"\n\"Huh?\" Drexel’s mind, still muddled from his daydreaming, took a moment to process her question before replying, \"Curiosity. The Moon Goddess Temple is famous; wouldn’t it be a shame not to check it out?\"\n\"Is that the only reason?\" Arix tilted her head, looking puzzled.\n\"What else could it be?\" Drexel asked, genuinely confused.\nArix frowned and probed, \"Do you know about Grandpa, I mean, Mom’s dad?\"\n\"Yeah, I know. Didn’t he die? Why are you bringing him up now?\" Drexel replied, puzzled.\n\"No! Who told you that?\" Arix gasped, her eyes nearly popping out of her head. The Pontifex of the Empire was very much alive.\n\"Mom said so. When I asked where Grandpa went, she said he was in some far far away place. Isn’t that just a nicer way of saying he died?\" Drexel scratched the back of his head.\nHe remembered a classmate’s father who had died, and his mother had explained it the same way.\n\"I think what Mom meant was that Grandpa can’t visit us, but he’s still alive,\" Arix tried not to sound too critical.\n\"Whatever. If Grandpa is really alive but hasn’t come back to see us all these years, it means we’re not important to him. So why should we care about him?\" Drexel said indifferently, shrugging.\nEven though his words were harsh, they made some sense. Arix felt a bit deflated thinking about it. Maybe Grandpa really didn’t care about them.\nOutside the Moon Goddess Temple...\nDrexel clutched Arix as they huddled in a nearby alley. He quietly eyed the activity around the Moon Goddess Temple.\nBy the main entrance, aside from the occasional believers in robes coming and going, two knights in armor stood on guard.\nArix peered around for a bit. She noticed that security at the Moon Goddess Temple was pretty tight, making it seem unlikely they could sneak in.\n\"How are we going to get in? Should we dig a dog door again?\" Arix asked, turning to Drexel.\n\"No, this time we’re going in openly,\" Drexel replied, setting Arix on the ground. He then pulled out a set of white and gold robes from his Space Button.\n\"Aren’t those the believers’ robes? When did you get them?\" Arix asked, surprised.\n\"I came across a vendor selling them while shopping, so I bought one just in case,\" Drexel said, putting on the robes and pulling up the hood. At a glance, he really did look just like one of the believers.\n\"But even if we dress like this, we can’t get in. Those knights seem to be checking identities,\" Arix pointed out the main issue.\nDrexel raised an eyebrow and gave a mysterious smile, \"I have a plan, but you need to cooperate with me.\"\n\"You’re not thinking of another crazy idea, are you?\" Arix shivered, feeling a sudden chill.\n\"You’ll see soon enough,\" Drexel said, a slight smile on his lips as he picked up Arix again. Then he headed straight for the main entrance of the Moon Goddess Temple.\n\"Wait, aren’t we going to disguise ourselves?\" Arix asked nervously in a low voice.\n\"Don’t worry, trust me,\" Drexel reassured her, patting her on the head.\nArix still had doubts, but Drexel already walked to the door. Thus, she had no choice but to go along with Drexel’s plan.\n\"Stop! No unauthorized persons allowed in the Moon Goddess Temple!\" The two knights crossed their swords at the entrance, looking very serious as they shouted.\n\"I am Drexel, a believer, here by order of the Pontifex to bring the young Tiger clan member to him,\" Drexel said, suddenly looking like a different person. He made a look of detachment and indifference, just like a real believer.\nThe two knights looked suspiciously at Arix, but when they saw the blue gemstone necklace on her chest, they were taken aback. They immediately bowed and said respectfully, \"Please come in, Your Excellency!\"\nThey stepped aside and quietly waited for them to pass through.\nDrexel was confused.\n’This isn’t how I planned it!’\nDrexel’s eye twitched slightly. But under the knights’ serious gazes, he forced himself to stay calm and walked into the Moon Goddess Temple.\nAfter the siblings walked away, one of the knights looked a bit puzzled and asked, \"They seemed quite suspicious. Are we sure it’s okay to just let them in?\"\n\"The person who has that necklace has been approved by the Moon Goddess Herself. If the Moon Goddess acknowledges them, why should we doubt?\" the older knight said calmly.\n\"Oh, I see,\" the younger knight replied, letting go of his doubts and resuming his post.\nMeanwhile, Drexel and Arix, who had successfully snuck in, found a small room to hide in. They both slumped to the floor with relief.\n\"Phew, I thought we were going to get caught!\" Drexel said, patting his chest nervously.\n\"Wasn’t that a bit too easy?\" Arix frowned, feeling it was too good to be true.\n\"Now that you mention it, something does feel off. I had prepared a whole bunch of excuses, but they let us in after just one sentence,\" Drexel said, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.\n\"It seemed like they saw something that made them let us through,\" Arix recalled the knights’ expressions and then looked down at the necklace Cassian had given her.\n’Was it because of this?’\nSeeing Arix staring at the necklace, Drexel laughed and teased, \"You don’t really think it’s because of that necklace, do you? How could a necklace be that powerful?\"\n\"Then what do you think it was? Your HANDSOME face?\" Arix snapped, putting down the blue gemstone necklace and giving Drexel a fierce look.\nRaising an eyebrow, Drexel pulled out a small mirror from his Space Button and admired his face. \"Well, now that you mention it, it’s quite possible,\" he said smugly.\n\"Alright, enough joking. Let’s look around and then leave,\" Arix said, deciding to change the subject as she couldn’t be bothered to argue with Drexel.\nDrexel shrugged but didn’t object. He put away the mirror and gently picked up Arix. Then he carefully pushed the door open.\nHe saw no one around and stepped out.\n\"Where should we go?\" Drexel asked, looking around the vast expanse of the Moon Goddess Temple.\n\"Let’s check out the Pontifex’s place,\" Arix suggested, feeling a strange urge to see him.\n\"The Pontifex? Are you sure, Arix? Wandering around the Moon Goddess Temple is one thing, but if the Pontifex catches us, Uncle might skin us alive!\" Drexel said, his face full of fear.\nHe felt that Arix was even crazier than him, always wanting to go to the most dangerous places.\n\"The Pontifex is our grandfather,\" Arix decided not to hide it from Drexel anymore.\n\"Oh, okay... Wait, grandfather?\" Drexel almost choked on his shock. He lifted Arix, shaking her in disbelief. \"Did I hear you right? Did you say the Empire’s Pontifex is our grandfather?\"\n\"Yes, Mom’s dad,\" Arix confirmed with a nod.\nThe air was still for a moment.\nThe siblings stared at each other for a long time.\nFinally, Arix blinked and tentatively asked, \"So, are we still going to see the Pontifex?\"\nDrexel wiped his face with a hand. His gaze then became firm. \"Yes, we’re going!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 142: Thyrsus\nOnce they had made up their minds, Drexel and Arix followed the map on the opticomputer and tracked down the location of the Pontifex.\nThis place was the heart of the Moon Goddess Temple. The buildings here looked grander and more sacred than anywhere else.\nArix and Drexel hid by the entrance of the main hall, sneaking peeks inside. An old man in priest robes was praying to the Moon Goddess statue, his back to them.\n\"What now? We can’t see his face,\" Drexel whispered, stretching his neck to get a better view.\n\"How about we sneak in?\" Arix suggested.\n\"No way. If we alert him, they will skin us alive,\" Drexel shot back.\n\"What are you doing here?\" a voice suddenly asked from behind them.\nArix and Drexel froze, turning slowly like wooden dolls.\nAn old man in priest robes stood there, smirking.\n\"You still haven’t answered my question. What are you doing here?\" His smile was professional, his eyes kind yet chilling.\n\"Um... we’re here to find... Arix, run!\" Drexel stammered. They backed away slowly, then bolted out when they were a meter away from the door.\n\"Heh!\" The old man chuckled coldly, waving his hand.\nSuddenly, countless black figures appeared out of nowhere, quickly surrounding them.\nDrexel held Arix tightly with one arm, manifesting a blue-tinged psychic spear with the other. He eyed the black figures warily.\n\"Oh, you have talent. Would you like to stay and become a Pontifex?\" The old man seemed intrigued by the psychic spear.\nBefore Drexel could answer, Arix exploded with anger.\nShe bared her small fangs, growling at the old man. \"Don’t even think about it! My brother’s going to get married and give me cute nephews!\"\nDrexel blinked.\n’Thanks, but I’m not planning on getting married young!’\n\"Heh.\" The old man laughed, but his gaze turned sharp as a blade. \"The Tiger clan is always so annoying, even the little ones.\"\nWith that, he unleashed his immense psychic power at Arix.\nDrexel quickly set her down and swung his spear at the old man. But he was no match.\nThe spear barely touched the old man’s attack before Drexel was slammed to the ground, skidding several meters across the floor.\n\"Pfft—\" Drexel used the spear to stop his slide, but as he came to a halt, he coughed up a mouthful of blood.\n\"Drexel!\" Arix rushed to his side, her eyes filled with concern. Seeing the blood on the ground, she turned a fierce gaze toward the old man, an intense killing intent emanating from her. This was the first time Arix had ever felt the urge to kill.\n\"Cupid!\" Arix called out in her mind.\n\"I’m here!\" Cupid responded, transforming into a surge of psychic power that quickly flowed out from within her. A force more terrifying than the old man’s psychic power surrounded Arix, ready to strike back at any moment.\n\"Supergiant+ psychic power.\" The old man in the white robe frowned, surprised as he looked at the young girl.\nHowever, his killing intent only deepened. He knew this little cub must be the new pureblood of the Tiger clan. If he could kill her today, it would be a devastating blow to them.\nWith that thought, the old man’s pupils turned vertical, and his psychic power transformed into a massive lizard, striking toward Arix.\n\"Stop!\"\nAt that moment, a psychic barrier intercepted the old man’s attack, shielding Arix and her brother. The Pontifex had arrived without anyone noticing.\n\"Thyrsus, who gave you permission to act in my hall?\" Vezgor looked at the old man with a cold, indifferent expression, as if he were an insignificant insect.\n\"Your Holiness, I was just trying to catch these little thieves. If I’ve caused any disturbance, please forgive me.\" Thyrsus, upon seeing who had arrived, realized there was no longer any chance for him. He quickly bowed his head and admitted his fault.\nVezgor seemed indifferent to Thyrsus’s explanation. He glanced at Arix and Drexel, his expression changing slightly upon seeing their condition.\n\"They came here at my behest,\" Vezgor said calmly.\nThyrsus knew Vezgor was lying but could do nothing about it. Grinding his teeth in frustration, he forced a twisted smile and said, \"So it was just a misunderstanding. In that case, Your Holiness, I’ll take my leave.\"\nThyrsus turned to leave, but Vezgor’s voice halted him.\n\"Wait. You attacked my people. Priest Thyrsus, shouldn’t you provide an explanation?\"\nThyrsus’s eyebrow twitched as he struggled to contain his anger. He turned back with a forced smile, \"What more do Your Holiness require? I will comply with any request.\"\n\"I don’t have any specific requests, but there are always consequences for attacking my people,\" Vezgor said. Then, a surge of psychic power, just as formidable as Arix’s, pierced a large hole through Thyrsus’s shoulder.\nThe searing pain in his shoulder made Thyrsus grunt, and he instantly fell to his knees in a pathetic state. Yet, he didn’t even have the courage to lift his head. He kept it bowed, teeth clenched, not daring to retaliate against the man before him.\nAfter punishing Thyrsus, Vezgor paid him no further attention. Instead, he turned to Arix and Drexel, saying, \"Come with me.\"\nArix and Drexel exchanged a glance and grinned, their faces lighting up with happiness. \"Sure thing!\" they chimed in unison.\nAs they walked away, Arix couldn’t resist sticking her tongue out at Thyrsus, making a taunting face. She then huffed triumphantly and skipped after her brother.\nThyrsus watched the trio leave with a cold gaze. Wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth, he issued a chilling command to the black-robed figures around him, \"Find out who those two are.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" the black figures responded respectfully, Then they walked out and vanished into thin air.\n\"Vezgor, I will settle this score with you sooner or later! Just you wait!\" Thyrsus muttered coldly. Clutching his bleeding shoulder, he turned and left the scene.\nIn the grand hall, Vezgor sat cross-legged on a cushion, quietly watching the siblings.\nArix and Drexel were initially nervous but soon became restless.\nDrexel, filled with doubts, locked eyes with Pontifex Vezgor. Meanwhile, Arix’s gaze was fixed on the statue of the Moon Goddess.\nThe Moon Goddess, named Sylvana, had two forms like everyone in the Empire.\nIn her human form, she wore a crescent crown, a long white robe, and carried a torch. She was as radiant and beautiful as the moon.\nIn her beast form, she was a blend of white tiger, white deer, and white wolf. Her snow-white body, both elegant and mysterious, had massive wings. It was said that those wings could obscure the stars of the galaxy when spread.\nAs Arix stared at the statue, a deep sense of awe filled her heart.\n\"Do you like the Moon Goddess?\" Vezgor suddenly asked, looking at Arix.\nArix was caught off guard, flattered that the Pontifex was speaking to her. She quickly nodded. \"Yes, Grand... um... Your Holiness. Is the Moon Goddess really named Sylvana?\"\nShe had wanted to call him grandpa but worried Vezgor might not appreciate it, so she chose a more respectful title.\n\"Yes, Her esteemed name is Sylvana,\" Vezgor replied solemnly. His cold face showed no expression, and he didn’t seem to mind Arix’s formal address.\n\"Can you tell us the story of Sylvana and how she became the Moon Goddess of the Empire?\" Arix asked, surprised at how approachable her grandfather seemed. Her previous tension eased.\nDrexel, hearing his sister’s question, turned his attention to Vezgor. He, too, was curious about the Moon Goddess, despite finding little useful information online.\n\"Sure,\" Vezgor nodded gently, meeting their eager gazes.\nHe began to recount Sylvana’s story.\nSylvana’s rise to a common Goddess started with the origins of the Empire. The ancestors of the Empire’s people came from ancient Earth, living before Earth’s first great catastrophe.\nDuring this mythic era, life was primitive, and various clans constantly competed. The Wolf clan emerged victorious, becoming the supreme ruling tribe.\nThe wolves had their own deity, Sylvana.\nWhen the Great Flood occurred, the wolves prayed to her. As the floodwaters rose and despair set in, Sylvana appeared.\nShe used all her power to create a crescent-moon ship, transferring all remaining life on ancient Earth to other habitable star systems.\nBut Sylvana exhausted her divine power in the process and fell into a deep sleep, disappearing without a trace. To honor her sacrifice, the beings she saved built what was now the Moon Goddess Temple in their new home.\n\"I see,\" Arix said, rising to bow slightly to the statue, showing sincere respect.\n\"Sylvana is a deity worthy of reverence,\" Drexel added, performing a formal Empire salute to the statue.\nSeeing their actions, a slight smile appeared on Vezgor’s lips, his eyes filled with affection. But when the siblings looked his way, Vezgor quickly concealed his emotions.\nArix and Drexel exchanged glances, unsure of what to say.",

      "content": "Chapter 143: The Miserable Siblings\n\"Do you have any other questions?\" Vezgor asked, his eyes still warm despite his calm expression.\nThe siblings shared a look. Arix nodded slightly and turned back to Vezgor.\n\"Do you want to leave the Moon Goddess Temple? Mom told us you didn’t join voluntarily,\" Arix asked, her voice filled with concern and a bit of awkwardness.\nDrexel quickly added, \"If you want to leave, we’ll do everything we can to help you.\"\nTheir concern left Vezgor silent for a long time. Just as they started feeling uneasy, thinking they might have upset him, Vezgor finally spoke.\nHe shook his head and calmly said, \"The Moon Goddess Temple is not a burden or a prison for me. The Moon Goddess gave me hope when I was most desperate. Serving her is something I will never regret or resent, not in the past, nor in the future.\"\n\"Don’t you miss us and Mom? Especially mom, she grew up without a father,\" Drexel’s emotions surged, and he questioned Vezgor.\nDrexel’s heart ached for his sister and especially for Fleur, who lived alone in the Alliance, away from her family in the Empire. Fleur was a child left to face the rain alone because she had no umbrella.\nAfter venting, Drexel squatted down, hugging his head, and muttered, \"Sorry, I lost control.\"\n\"Grandpa is...\" Arix started to explain, but Vezgor interrupted her.\n\"No need to explain. The biggest regrets of my life are for my daughter and my wife. But knowing that you are there gives me peace of mind. It’s getting late; you should head back now,\" Vezgor said, closing his eyes and falling silent.\nDrexel clenched his fists, anger simmering at Vezgor’s seemingly detached words. After a moment of tense silence, he let out a cold snort and abruptly left the grand hall.\n\"Drexel!\" Arix called out, worried, as Drexel stormed off. She had never seen him so angry that he forgot about her.\nArix glanced in the direction her brother had gone, then she turned back to Vezgor. \"I’ll come visit you again,\" she said before hurrying after Drexel.\nAfter the siblings left, Vezgor opened his eyes once more, quietly watching the direction they had gone. His lashes lowered, concealing the complexity in his gaze.\nArix bolted after Drexel, but it turned out he hadn’t gone far. He stood nearby, waiting for her.\nA warm feeling bloomed in Arix chest as she approached the brooding Drexel. \"Hey, are you alright?\" she asked, her voice soft with concern.\nDrexel shook his head silently. Then, with a sigh, he bent down to pick up Arix. \"Arix, let’s go home,\" he said, his voice tinged with disappointment.\n\"Sure, let’s go home,\" Arix agreed, nuzzling against Drexel to comfort him.\nHer rare show of affection brought a faint smile to his lips. He gently patted her fur and said, his tone sentimental, \"Arix, tell me about Grandpa.\"\nArix nodded, thinking for a moment. \"I don’t know much about Grandpa. Mom said he and Grandma were the strongest in the Tiger clan. They fell in love and had Mom. But one day, Grandma got very sick, and Grandpa joined the Moon Goddess Temple to save her, becoming a pontifex. The pontifexes are dedicated to the Moon Goddess for life. They can’t marry or fall in love. If they do, the Temple hunts them down. So, Grandpa and Grandma had to separate. Grandma, heartbroken, brought Mom to the Alliance, but she passed away when Mom turned eighteen.\"\n\"That’s all I know. But honestly, I can understand Grandpa’s actions. If one day...\" Arix trailed off as Drexel clamped his hand over her snout.\n\"Arix, think more positively, will you?\" Drexel said, rolling his eyes as he held her mouth shut.\nArix nodded pitifully, mumbling through his hand until he let go. He then tapped her forehead lightly with his finger.\nRubbing her sore forehead with her paws, Arix glared at Drexel, a mix of pain and anger in her eyes. But remembering how sad Drexel was today, she held back the urge to bite him and let out a small huff, deciding to let it go.\nSeeing his sister’s uncharacteristic gentleness, Drexel’s gloomy expression finally lifted. He smiled and, feeling content, carried her towards their home. Before leaving the Moon Goddess Temple, Drexel glanced back in the direction of Vezgor. Without a word, he turned and left.\nBack in the alley with the dog door, Drexel moved aside two broken baskets and lifted Arix through first. When it was his turn, he reminded her, \"If I get stuck, help me out, alright?\"\nBut after waiting for a while, he heard no response from Arix inside the wall.\nDrexel frowned and asked in confusion, \"Arix, are you still there?\"\nHe called again, but there was no response from the other side of the wall. Feeling a bit annoyed, he grumbled, \"Didn’t even wait for me before going ahead.\"\nMuttering under his breath, he began to squeeze through the hole. Halfway through, just as he got stuck, a pair of military boots appeared in front of him.\nDrexel froze. Looking up stiffly, he saw a man in an Empire captain’s uniform holding Arix, glaring at him with a furious stare.\nDrexel swallowed hard, forcing a smile onto his face. Trying to deflect, he turned to Arix and asked, \"Hey Arix, this guy looks really impressive. Who is he?\"\nArix, covering her eyes with her paws as if giving up, replied, \"This is Sunak. Mom asked him to take care of me.\"\nHearing this, Drexel’s smile grew even more strained. Trying to ingratiate himself, he flashed a sycophantic grin at Sunak and said, \"Hi, Sunak. I’m your nephew, Drexel. Nice to meet you.\"\nSunak smiled back, somewhat mockingly, and pulled Drexel out of the hole. \"I was wondering how such a cute and obedient cub like Arix could be so mischievous. Now I see why,\" Sunak said, looking at Drexel with a meaningful smile.\nDrexel lowered his eyes, standing there obediently while Sunak lectured him. He didn’t dare protest, barely even breathing, afraid that Sunak might report him to his mom if he showed any defiance.\nSunak lectured Drexel for quite a while before finally letting him off. Then, he turned his gaze to Arix, who was giggling at her brother’s predicament.\nSensing Sunak’s stare, Arix’s smile froze, and she quickly put on an innocent, adorable look, letting out a soft \"awoo\" sound, \"Sunak, I’m a good cub.\"\n\"Oh, you? Really? You think I don’t know how much trouble you’ve been causing while I was away?\" Sunak said, grabbing Arix’s ear playfully but firmly.\n\"Ouch, it hurts! Sunak, be gentle. I’m just a kid; you can’t use violence on me,\" Arix cried out, feigning a pitiful look.\n\"You won’t learn your lesson if it doesn’t hurt. And you, a kid? I haven’t seen any kid who could turn IRMA upside down, beat Kares until he couldn’t get out of bed, and end up losing control of his psychic powers!\" Sunak scolded, grinding his teeth in frustration.\nGod knows how anxious and scared he was when he received the news about Arix’s psychic power going out of control.\nIf Krylak hadn’t assured him that the cub was safe, he would’ve abandoned his mission and rushed back from the border, risking the military’s wrath. He couldn’t bear the thought of anything happening to this troublemaking cub again.\n\"Sunak, Sunak, please stop pulling my ear. I know I was wrong, okay?\" Arix begged, tears welling up in her eyes.\nSeeing his sister’s ear turning bright red, Drexel finally spoke up, \"Sunak, if you have to pull someone’s ear, pull mine. I can take it.\"\n\"Yeah, yeah, Sunak, if you need to pull an ear, pull Drexel’s,\" Arix added quickly, throwing Drexel under the bus without a second thought.\nDrexel stared at her, speechless.\n\"Sunak, just keep pulling her ear!\" he muttered.",

      "content": "Chapter 144: Meeting Amethyst Again\nSeeing Drexel’s downcast face, Sunak’s anger melted away, a grin spreading across his face. \"I’ll let you off this time. But mess up again, and I’ll tell your mother,\" he said, chuckling.\nDrexel and Arix nodded vigorously, their voices overlapping as they promised, \"We won’t do it again!\"\nSunak’s expression turned serious. \"Alright, I’ll take your word for it. The ceremony is soon, so stick around. If I catch you wandering off, you know what will happen,\" he warned, even miming a throat-slashing gesture.\nThe two siblings gulped, shaking their heads quickly. \"We won’t, we won’t,\" they echoed.\n\"Okay, off you go,\" Sunak said with a satisfied smile.\nThey bolted, feeling as if they were hearing the sweetest music, racing back home.\nSunak watched them flee as if wolves were on their heels, finally letting out a hearty laugh.\nThree days later, on the eve of the blessing ceremony, the entire Empire buzzed with anticipation. From commoners to nobles, everyone was busy preparing for the grand event.\nHomes were alive with activity. Adults cleaned and decorated with new posters of Sylvana, the Moon Goddess, while children donned fresh clothes, excited for the upcoming ceremony.\nArix and Drexel, heeding Sunak’s stern warning, had stayed home these past few days.\nFortunately, after the ceremony, they would head back to the Alliance. On this last day, Krylak finally lifted their house arrest.\n\"I’m visiting the palace today to say goodbye to Cassian’s parents. Want to come?\" Arix asked, checking the gifts for Cassian’s parents in her Space Button.\nAs she prepared to leave, she turned back to Drexel.\n\"Cassian’s parents? The Empire’s Alpha Leonidas and Luna Amethyst? You know them?\" Drexel asked, astonished.\n\"I’ve met them a few times. They’re nice,\" Arix said, smiling at the thought of the contrasting couple.\n\"Then I’ll come too. I’ve never met Alpha Leonidas and Luna Amethyst,\" Drexel said, excitement lighting up his eyes.\n\"Alright, I’ll wait for you at the main gate,\" Arix replied, heading off to ask the butler to arrange a beast-drawn carriage.\n\"I’ll be quick.\" Drexel dashed to get ready.\nSoon, Drexel and Arix were in the carriage, arriving at the palace gates.\nAs they stepped out, Cassian, who had been waiting, opened his arms and greeted Arix with a warm smile, \"Arix.\"\n\"Cassian.\" Arix leaped into his arms, playfully nuzzling him. \"Were you waiting at the gate just for me?\" she teased.\nCassian affectionately patted Arix’s fluffy head, his voice dripping with tenderness. \"Yeah, I just wanted to spend more time with you.\"\n\"Tsk, listen to this sweet talk. Cassian, come clean, how many young women have you charmed with these lines?\" Arix teased, raising an eyebrow playfully.\nCassian sighed and gently tapped her head. \"None, but I wish there was one. Sadly, that one person is too smart to be wooed.\"\n\"Why are you tapping my head then?\" Arix pouted, rubbing her head and glaring at him with mock indignation.\nCassian sighed again, ruffling her hair soothingly. \"Sorry, Arix, I was too hasty.\"\n\"Hmph, I’ll let it slide this time. But if you do it again, we’ll be at odds for a whole week,\" Arix said, feigning magnanimity.\nCassian laughed softly, then ruffled her hair once more. \"Alright, let’s go meet Mother and Father. Drexel, you come too.\"\nDrexel, feeling a bit jittery about meeting the Empire’s high-ranking figures, nodded and followed them calmly.\nAs they walked through the palace, Arix and Drexel witnessed Cassian’s influence firsthand. Everyone they passed, from maids to ministers, greeted him with deep respect, to which Cassian responded with polite nods.\nAfter about ten minutes, they found Alpha Leonidas and Luna Amethyst in a garden, admiring the flowers.\n\"Oh, isn’t this little Arix? Come here and let me have a good look at you,\" Luna Amethyst’s eyes sparkled with joy when she saw Arix, beckoning her over.\nArix, beaming, darted out of Cassian’s arms and leaped into Luna Amethyst’s embrace.\n\"Auntie, did you miss me?\" Arix asked in a sweet, childish voice.\n\"How could I not? I missed you so much, you little rascal, always forgetting to visit,\" Luna Amethyst replied, tapping Arix’s forehead with gentle reproach.\n\"I missed you too, but I got into trouble and Uncle Krylak grounded me,\" Arix pouted, snuggling closer.\nLuna Amethyst laughed, remembering the incident. \"Was it about the IRMA matter?\"\n\"Yeah, Auntie, do you think I was too harsh? Kares is from the Empire after all,\" Arix asked, worry in her voice.\nLuna Amethyst smiled and lifted Arix to look her in the eyes seriously. \"Arix.\"\n\"Hmm?\" Arix shrank back, her eyes darting around, unable to meet Luna Amethyst’s gaze. The thought that Luna Amethyst might dislike her because of the IRMA incident made her heart sink. Her mood plummeted, and her expression grew dim.\nNoticing Arix’s drooping ears, Luna Amethyst felt a mix of exasperation and heartbreak. \"Arix, what I meant to say is, even if you hit Cassian, I wouldn’t be angry. So why would I care about Kares? He means nothing to me.\"\nHearing this, Arix’s eyes instantly lit up, her energy returning. She snuggled closer to Luna Amethyst, her voice sweet and affectionate. \"You’re the best. I like you the most.\"\nOverjoyed by Arix’s sweet talk, Luna Amethyst showered her with endless endearments and affection.\nArix’s face brightened with relief. \"Thanks. That means a lot.\"\n\"Anytime, my dear. Now, let’s enjoy this beautiful day,\" Luna Amethyst said, giving Arix a warm hug before setting her down.\nArix and Luna Amethyst were as close as real mother and daughter.\nDrexel was instantly curious and nudged Cassian with his elbow, whispering, \"Is my sister really that close with your mom?\"\nCassian looked puzzled and asked back, \"Yes, but why ask?\"\nArix was so likable, and Cassian thought his mom naturally liked her as everybody else would; if someone didn’t like Arix, the problem had to be with themselves.\nWatching Cassian, who seemed to adore Arix even more than he did, Drexel felt a bit defeated.\nHe quickly lifted his chin with a proud expression and said, \"Of course! My sister is so adorable. If someone doesn’t like her, they must have something wrong with them.\"\nDrexel felt a bit guilty, thinking he might have exaggerated a bit. But to his surprise, Cassian nodded in agreement, \"You’re right. Anyone who doesn’t like Arix must be a bad person.\"\nAlthough Drexel agreed that Arix was great, he didn’t think it was to such an extreme extent. He had a wild guess, that Cassian clearly had some kind of predisposition. Otherwise, how could he see Arix through such rose-colored glasses that even her brother felt a bit inferior in comparison?\n’Yikes! Better keep a distance from him, just in case it rubs off.’\nWith this thought, Drexel quietly moved a step to the side.\nCassian didn’t even notice Drexel’s movement; his attention was fully on Luna Amethyst and Arix. Arix and Luna Amethyst continued their affectionate exchange for quite a while.\nIt wasn’t until Luna Amethyst accidentally looked up and noticed the new guest today. She gazed warmly at Drexel, smiling as she greeted him, \"You must be Arix’s brother, right? No need to be shy, come over and sit. Cassian, you too, come sit.\"\nCassian smiled and pointed Drexel to a seat. \"Thank you, Luna Amethyst,\" Drexel said shyly, performing the Empire’s salute before sitting down next to the two big shots with Cassian.\nLuna Amethyst studied Drexel for a moment and nodded slightly. Her smile deepened as she said, \"No need to be so formal. Just call me Aunt Amy.\"\n\"Alright, thank you, Aunt Amethyst,\" Drexel responded, feeling both flattered and a bit overwhelmed. Even at home, his mom wasn’t this gentle with him.\nHe was moved to tears—Cassian’s mom was really nice! Luna Amethyst nodded at Drexel, then turned her gaze back to Arix in her arms. She asked fondly, \"Arix, are you here to say goodbye today?\"\n\"Yeah, I’m heading back to the Alliance the day after tomorrow. These are my parting gifts for you.\" Arix nodded and then hopped onto the table. From her Space Button, she pulled out the gifts she’d prepared and handed them to Alpha Leonidas and Luna Amethyst.",

      "content": "Chapter 145: Precious Gifts\nArix presented two beautiful sachets. The light purple one had a purple fox embroidered on it, while the pure black one had a majestic white werewolf. She first pushed the black sachet towards Alpha Leonidas and then gave the light purple one to Luna Amethyst.\nAlpha Leonidas, surprised to receive a gift, picked up the black sachet, examining it with interest. \"Is this a sachet?\" Luna Amethyst asked, both surprised and curious, as she looked over the small item in her hand.\nArix nodded, feeling a bit shy. \"Yes, I made it myself. The sachets are filled with medicinal ingredients that help calm the mind and soothe the spirit. I hope you like them.\"\n\"How could not? We love it! Arix, you’re so sweet,\" Luna Amethyst replied, clearly delighted as she admired the delicate sachet.\nIt wasn’t just the function but also the craftsmanship that captivated her. The fox, in particular, looked just like her true form, showing how much thought Arix had put into the gift.\n\"Arix, don’t you think something’s missing?\" Cassian suddenly interjected with a pout.\nArix rolled her eyes at him before retrieving a light blue sachet from her Space Button. \"I prepared this for you earlier. See if you like it,\" Arix said, pushing the sachet with a werewolf pup towards Cassian.\n\"I love anything from you, Arix,\" Cassian said, cherishing the sachet as he examined it.\nLuna Amethyst watched her son’s interaction with Arix, a smile playing on her lips.\nShe couldn’t help thinking how Cassian’s sweet demeanor resembled hers, unlike his father, who was terrible at wooing girls back in the day.\nLuna Amethyst glanced disdainfully at Alpha Leonidas, remembering how clueless he was when they were younger. He’d acted more like he was picking a fight than courting her. It took several one-on-one duels before she figured out his true intentions.\nShaking her head with a smile, Luna Amethyst brought out two gift boxes and placed them in front of the siblings. \"Aunt Amy, what is this?\" Arix asked, surprised to receive a gift in return.\nLuna Amethyst winked and put a finger to her lips, signaling for silence. \"These are gifts for you, but what’s inside is a secret for now. Arix, you must wait until you get home to open it.\"\n\"Thank you, Aunt Amy.\" Arix, though curious, nodded obediently and tucked the gift into her Space Button.\nThe siblings chatted for a while longer before finally bidding farewell to Alpha Leonidas and Luna Amethyst.\nAs they walked out of the palace, Cassian suddenly remembered Arix’s previous wish. \"Oh, Arix, the Celesterror Protection Act will be announced the day after tomorrow,\" he said, knowing how much Arix had been waiting for this news.\nAs expected, Arix perked up immediately, her excitement obvious. \"Really?!\"\nCassian nodded confidently. \"Yes, the national council has already approved it. Now, it’s just waiting for the official announcement.\"\n\"That’s fantastic! Mama Tiger will be so happy,\" Arix said, thinking of Mama Tiger and her four cubs. A genuine smile spread across her face. With the Celesterror Protection Act in place, she could return to the Alliance with peace of mind.\nChapter 172 A Nice Mecha\nOn the way back, Arix sat in the carriage. She looked a bit lost, staring at a new Space Button in her hand.\nCassian had just given it to her, insisting that the previous gift didn’t count and this was a replacement. But Arix knew Cassian was just giving her another goodie, thinking she needed it.\nArix sighed. She had already accepted it, so there was no turning back. Fortunately, her Arix Crystal dividend from the Alliance had arrived, so she could plan a return gift for Cassian once she got home.\nDrexel noticed Arix’s mixed feelings about the gift, which only soured his mood more. \"Arix, if you don’t want it, I can do you a favor and take it off your hands,\" he said, his eyes gleaming with envy as he eyed the Space Button.\nArix looked at her brother, almost ready to scold him. But knowing that he had no income and was under their mom’s strict watch, she softened. \"I’ll check when I get back. If I don’t need it, I’ll give it to you.\"\nDrexel hadn’t expected his offhand comment to result in Arix actually considering sharing the gift. He felt a surge of pride, like a father watching his kid grow up. The gift itself didn’t matter; it was the thought that counted, making all his care for Arix feel worthwhile.\nThe more Drexel thought about it, the warmer his gaze became. He reached out to ruffle Arix’s hair, feeling a glow inside as he said, \"I was just joking. This is from your friend, so you should keep it.\"\nArix looked at Drexel in surprise, not expecting such a noble response.\nBut the truth was, Drexel regretted it instantly, feeling like crying inside.\nPretending to be generous while being broke was tough.\nFeeling worse by the second, Drexel took out the gift Luna Amethyst had given him, planning to open it to lift his spirits.\n\"Didn’t Auntie say to wait until we got back? Are you opening it now?\" Arix asked, curious.\n\"We’re almost home, so it doesn’t matter,\" Drexel said, finding a weak excuse. Then he opened the box. Inside was a mecha-specific Space Button necklace.\nSeeing the necklace, both siblings’ eyes widened in disbelief. They stared, confirming they weren’t seeing things.\n\"It’s a mecha Space Button!\" Arix exclaimed, her mouth hanging open in shock.\nDrexel swallowed hard. If there was really a mecha inside, this gift would be insanely valuable.\nAfter a tense glance between them, Arix signaled with her eyes for him to check the Space Button.\nDrexel nodded, his fingers trembling as he picked up the necklace. Slowly, he channeled his psychic power into it\nWhen he saw what was inside, his heart skipped a beat and then started racing. He withdrew his psychic power and stared at the necklace, his face a mix of shock and disbelief.\n\"What’s inside? Tell me already!\" Arix urged, impatiently.\n\"A m-m-mecha... I-I really saw a mecha,\" Drexel stammered, too nervous to get the words out.\n\"Well, duh! What’s in a mecha Space Button if not a mecha? A Connective Pod?\" Arix shot back, her sarcasm cutting through the tension.\nDrexel, still stunned, finally managed to say, \"Supergiant-Class.\"\nArix’s jaw dropped. She swallowed hard, her voice trembling, \"A S-Supergiant-Class mecha?\"\nDrexel nodded stiffly. Then he quickly added, \"You should check yours too!\"\n\"Oh, right! I have mine!\" Arix hurriedly opened her gift. As expected, it was also a mecha-specific Space Button necklace.\nTaking a deep breath, Arix channeled her psychic power into it. Inside, she saw a fiery red mecha holding a sword. The class of the mecha made her quickly withdraw her psychic power in shock.\n\"How is it? What class?\" Drexel asked anxiously.\n\"It’s also a Supergiant-Class mecha,\" Arix said, her voice shaking.\nUpon hearing this, Drexel fell silent. The siblings stared dumbfounded at the necklaces in their hands. Then Drexel suddenly looked at Arix.\n\"Arix, these are Supergiant-Class mechas worth billions of astrocredits. Do you think Luna Amethyst might have sent them by mistake?\" Drexel wasn’t blinded by the value and suspected an error.\nArix agreed. She opened her opticomputer and instructed, \"PP Boy, contact Luna Amethyst.\"\n\"Ding! Contacting Luna Amethyst, please wait.\" A 3D virtual screen popped up, followed by PP Boy’s voice.\nIt didn’t take long before Luna Amethyst appeared on the screen. \"Arix, missing me already?\" she said with a cheerful smile.\n\"Auntie, did you send the wrong gifts?\" Arix asked urgently.\n\"Did I? Weren’t they two mechas?\" Luna Amethyst tilted her head, looking confused.\n\"They are mechas, but they’re Supergiant-Class!\" Arix struggled to stay calm, fighting the urge to scream.\n\"Then there’s no mistake; they are indeed two Supergiant-Class mechas,\" Luna Amethyst confirmed, visibly relieved.\n\"That’s too...\" Arix began, but Luna Amethyst cut her off.\n\"Alright, Arix, it’s nothing to me, really. Be good, I have some things to take care of. Bye for now,\" Luna Amethyst said quickly before ending the call, almost as if she feared it might linger another second.\nAs the screen went dark, Arix put away the opticomputer, feeling a swirl of emotions. She looked at Drexel and said, a bit helplessly, \"She said she didn’t make a mistake.\"\n\"But these are way too valuable. Maybe we should ask Grandpa,\" Drexel suggested.\nArix nodded, thinking that was probably the best course of action.",

      "content": "Chapter 146: The Unfavored Kid\nSeeing that Arix agreed, Drexel opened the opticomputer to reach out to Matis.\n\"Drexel, what’s happening?\" Matis greeted warmly as he answered the video call.\n\"I...\" Drexel began, but Matis quickly cut him off.\n\"Where’s Arix? Isn’t she with you?\" Matis assumed Arix would be there, but she wasn’t visible on the screen.\nDrexel thought to himself,\n’It’s fine. I’m used to being the overlooked one—the ignored grandson, son, brother, nephew...’\nFeeling a bit of sorrow, Drexel sighed heavily, then lifted Arix onto his shoulder. \"Grandpa, Arix is here,\" Drexel said, trying to keep his tone humble.\n\"Oh, that’s good,\" Matis responded with a hint of indifference, before brightening up and beaming at his beloved granddaughter. \"Arix, do you miss me?\"\n\"Miss you so much, Grandpa,\" Arix replied sweetly.\nMatis glanced at Drexel, expecting a translation.\n\"She says she misses you,\" Drexel said flatly.\nDespite Drexel’s lack of emotion, Matis added his own warmth, smiling broadly.\nLooking fondly at Arix, Matis said warmly, \"I miss you too. I haven’t seen you for a month, and I think I’ve lost quite a few pounds.\"\n\"Please take care, Grandpa, or that will make me worry,\" Arix pouted adorably.\nMatis glanced at Drexel again for translation.\n\"She says you should take care,\" Drexel repeated, his face expressionless.\n\"Okay, okay. If my dear granddaughter says I should eat more, I will. When will you come back, Arix?\" Matis asked lovingly.\n\"Probably the day after tomorrow. Tomorrow we have the blessing ceremony, and then we’ll say goodbye to the others in the evening, so we’ll come back the day after,\" Arix explained in detail.\nThis time, Drexel preemptively translated, still with a blank expression, \"We’ll be back the day after tomorrow.\"\n\"Great, I’ll be waiting for Arix at home then,\" Matis said dotingly. Finally, he turned his attention to Drexel and asked, \"Drexel, anything you want to tell me today?\"\nDrexel paused, realizing it was his turn to speak. He gathered his thoughts and said, \"Luna Amethyst just gave Arix and me two mechas. We’re not sure if we should accept them.\"\n\"Mechas, huh? That’s quite a valuable gift. What class are they? Meteor Class or Comet Class? Considering they’re from Luna Amethyst, they can’t be something that low-level. Are they Moon-Class mechas?\" Matis asked calmly, taking a sip of his coffee.\n\"No, they’re not Moon-Class. They’re two Supergiant-Class mechas,\" Drexel explained.\nMatis choked on his coffee upon hearing this.\n\"Cough...\" Matis’s hacking coughs echoed, sounding painful.\nArix, her voice trembling with worry, quickly asked, \"Grandpa, are you okay?\"\n\"Grandpa, don’t get too excited. Take care of yourself,\" Drexel added, his brows knit with concern.\nIt took a moment for Matis to catch his breath, his hand rubbing his chest as he recovered.\n\"Drexel, next time you tell me something like this, wait until I’ve finished my coffee, okay?\" Matis said, still a bit shaken. He almost coughed his old life away.\n\"Sorry, Grandpa, my bad,\" Drexel apologized sincerely.\nMatis didn’t seem angry. After a moment of thought, he asked, \"Are you sure Luna Amethyst didn’t send it by mistake?\"\n\"No, Arix already asked, and Aunt Amy hung up quickly to make sure we couldn’t refuse,\" Drexel explained what had happened earlier.\n\"Got it. Do you two like the gifts?\" Matis asked.\nArix and Drexel exchanged a glance, then nodded together. It would be a lie to say they didn’t like Supergiant-Class mechas.\n\"Then accept it,\" Matis said with a smile, looking at his grandchildren lovingly.\nWhen they heard they could accept the gift, Arix and Drexel’s eyes lit up with joy, and they said in unison, \"Okay!\"\n\"Grandpa, should we send a gift back to them?\" Arix asked casually.\n\"She is asking if we should send a gift back to them,\" Drexel translated proactively for once.\n\"With the Empire’s wealth, there’s nothing they really need, but sending some Psychic Healers could be good,\" Matis considered.\n\"Do we have enough Arix Crystals?\" Arix asked, a bit worried. She had saved a lot before, but she hadn’t expected to stay in the Empire for so long.\nDrexel didn’t know what Arix Crystals were, but he translated, \"Do we have enough Arix Crystals?\"\nMentioning Arix Crystals gave Matis a bit of a headache. The Fifth Legion’s military research institute had been pestering him for more.\nSeeing Matis’s expression, Arix quickly understood.\n\"Don’t worry, Grandpa. I’ll refine more when I get back. If it’s urgent, we can send the Insectoid Core to the Empire and refine some there,\" Arix said sweetly and thoughtfully.\nDrexel had a feeling his sister was talking about something very significant. He translated obediently, \"She says she’ll refine more when she gets back. If it’s urgent, we can send the Insectoid Core to the Empire and refine some there.\"\nMatis looked at his considerate granddaughter, feeling his heart melt. With even softer eyes, he said, \"It’s okay, Arix. You can refine more when you get back. The Alliance’s current stock of Arix Crystals is enough. The ones for the Empire can wait until you’re back.\"\n\"Okay,\" Arix said, also breathing a sigh of relief.\nThis time, Drexel didn’t need to translate; Matis understood Arix’s meaning.\nHe smiled and said, \"If there’s nothing else, I have to get back to work. Goodbye, Arix.\"\nArix nodded obediently and said, \"Goodbye, Grandpa.\"\nMatis smiled and nodded before ending the video call.\nOnce Drexel tucked away his opticomputer, he immediately turned to Arix, curiosity in his eyes. \"What were you talking about with Grandpa? What’s the Arix Crystal?\"\nArix didn’t hesitate. \"The Arix Crystal is made from an Insectoid Core. It’s a catalyst for psychic power healing potions.\"\nDrexel, still puzzled, asked, \"Can’t anyone else make it?\"\n\"Nope, just me for now. I’m hoping to find a substitute eventually. Otherwise, when I die, the psychic power healing potion will disappear too,\" Arix replied, looking a bit worried.\nAt the mention of death, Drexel scolded her with a light tap on her head.\n\"Why did you hit me again?\" Arix grumbled, clutching her head in pain.\nShe was ready to complain to their mom if Drexel didn’t give a good answer.\n\"Because you shouldn’t talk like that! Why are you talking about dying at your age?\" Drexel shot back, irritated.\n\"But it’s true!\" Arix protested.\n\"Even if it is, you shouldn’t say it,\" Drexel insisted, his fingers poised for another tap.\nArix stared at him, deciding not to argue, especially with his fingers ready to strike again.\nJust then, the driver announced their arrival, breaking the tension. The two finally calmed down.\nBack at the villa, Arix noticed the hall door was open. Thinking of something, she quickly flew out of Drexel’s arms and hurried inside.\nDrexel, unsure what his sister was up to, raised an eyebrow and followed her.\n\"Scion, you’re back!\" Arix’s excited voice echoed through the hall.\nDrexel rolled his eyes. As expected.\nInside the hall, Arix was snuggled in Scion’s arms, adorably whining and complaining.\n’Of course, it’d be better if she isn’t complaining about me,’\nDrexel thought helplessly.\n\"Yes, Drexel’s a bad guy,\" Scion said with a smile, gently stroking Arix’s head.\n\"He’s the worst. He mistreated me all the time. You have no idea, while you were gone, he hit my head twice,\" Arix complained, rubbing her head against Scion’s palm.\nScion just smiled quietly, letting Arix continue.\nAfter a while, Arix’s curiosity got the best of her. \"Why are you back today, Scion? I thought I wouldn’t see you again before I returned to the Alliance.\"\n\"I’ll be hosting the blessing ceremony tomorrow,\" Scion replied gently.\nArix looked confused. \"Scion, are you becoming the Pontifex?\" she asked, shocked.\nScion shook his head and brushed Arix’s nose with his finger. \"No, just for tomorrow,\" he said with a hint of indulgence.\n\"That’s a relief,\" Arix sighed, finally feeling at ease. She didn’t want Scion ending up like their grandfather, stuck in the Moon Goddess Temple, trading his freedom for the prestigious title of Pontifex.\nEven though it was just one ceremony, Arix wasn’t thrilled. \"Why does it have to be you tomorrow? Scion, I don’t want you to become the Pontifex. That place is so cold, and you’d be all alone.\"\n\"It’s not that it has to be me tomorrow. Tomorrow’s blessing ceremony is for you, Arix. I don’t want to miss it,\" Scion explained, seeing her unhappiness and gently ruffling her head to comfort her.\nArix hadn’t expected this reason. She felt touched but still wasn’t fully convinced. Unsure how to persuade Scion otherwise, she lowered her head, feeling defeated.\n\"Arix,\" Scion called gently.\n\"Yes?\" Arix looked up, puzzled.\n\"This won’t happen again,\" Scion said. His usually icy blue eyes were now as gentle as the sky.\nBut this time, Arix wasn’t swayed by his looks. She bounced up happily. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes,\" Scion nodded with a smile.\n\"That’s great! Scion, let me tell you, the Moon Goddess Temple is really awful...\" Arix then spent a long time ranting about the temple until Drexel, growing impatient, picked her up and carried her to her room.\n\"Arix, it’s time for bed,\" Drexel said firmly, holding the reluctant Arix.\nShe gave Drexel an annoyed glare before saying regretfully to Scion, \"I’m going to bed now.\"\nScion nodded slightly with a smile.",

      "content": "Chapter 147: The Birdmen\nAfter Arix left, Scion turned his gaze to the entrance of the hall. \"Come in.\"\nFrom the entrance, Krylak emerged, scratching the back of his head awkwardly. \"I didn’t want to interrupt when I saw you were with the little one,\" he said.\nScion looked at Krylak calmly. \"I wasn’t lying.\"\n\"You didn’t lie, but you misled her. If Arix finds out the truth later, she’ll be really upset,\" Krylak said, sympathy in his voice.\nScion remained silent, but Krylak, who knew him well, could see the hidden sadness in him.\nKrylak sighed, as if comforting both Scion and himself. \"Maybe it’s better this way. If she finds out later, she’ll be sad later.\"\n\"Yes,\" Scion responded softly.\nThe next day, Sunak swung by to pick up Arix and Drexel for the blessing ceremony. When he got there, he found the siblings looking utterly wiped out, like they hadn’t slept a wink.\nHe gave them a once-over, clearly frustrated, and said, \"What did you two get up to last night? Digging dog doors again? Those dark circles are unreal!\"\nArix and Drexel shared a knowing glance, both instantly aware of what the other had been up to the previous night.\nNo one could blame them for being too excited to sleep when they had their own Supergiant-Class mecha.\nDespite their antics, they still had respect for their elders. Both Arix and Drexel apologized, looking sheepish, \"Sorry, Sunak, we messed up.\"\nSunak sighed and said, \"Alright, let’s get going.\"\n\"Okay,\" they replied, falling in line.\nThe blessing ceremony was a big deal in the Empire.\nOn this day, Sylvana’s presence was everywhere—from portraits and dolls to people dressed up as Sylvana. Especially the young ones from the Tiger clan, who already looked a lot like Sylvana, would dress themselves, making them almost indistinguishable from the deity.\nThese dressed-up Tiger clan kids would get all sorts of delighted reactions, and their parents loved the attention.\nNaturally, some races looked more like Sylvana than others.\nOutside the carriage, a bunch of \"lizard\" people were cosplaying as Sylvana, which made Arix cover her eyes with her paws, unable to handle the sight.\nThe young Dragon clan members were cute in an ugly sort of way, but the adults were flat-out terrifying! Their expanded wings were one thing, but their long thick body made them look like giant, fuzzy caterpillars.\nArix shivered and quietly shut the carriage curtains.\nAfter about ten minutes, the be carriage pulled up at the destination. The ceremony was held on Moon Goddess Mountain, the tallest peak in the Imperial Nexus.\nAt the summit, there was a huge statue of Sylvana surrounded by a spacious sacrificial platform.\nAround this main platform were seven smaller platforms for the royal family, nobles, the Tiger clan, the Dragon clan, the elves, the mermen, and the birdmen—each representing the Empire’s major powers.\nThe commoners could only stand below these platforms. The area was already packed, with parents holding their kids and others just there to witness the event.\nAfter stepping out of the carriage, Sunak led Arix and Drexel to the Tiger clan’s platform, where they waited quietly for the ceremony to begin.\nThe distance between the smaller platforms was quite large, so even though Arix was curious about the other races, she couldn’t see them clearly.\nHowever, the elves and birdmen on either side were fascinating enough to catch her interest.\nThe elves, with their golden hair and blue eyes, were truly a sight to behold.\nBoth the handsome young men and the beautiful young women seemed to have been blessed by the heavens in terms of looks. Arix admired them for a while before shifting her attention to the birdmen.\nThe birdmen were well-known for their love of food. Even now, they were casually grilling insect legs on their platform. This was the first time Arix realized that insectoids could be eaten. Seeing them enjoy the food so much made her curious about the taste.\nOne of the birdmen, who had red hair streaked with silver, noticed her gaze and waved cheerfully, as if inviting her to join them and try the food. Arix swallowed and asked, \"Sunak, can I go over to the birdmen’s platform?\"\nSunak glanced at the red-haired birdman and nodded. \"That’s Liaka. We’re on good terms. You can go over and visit for a bit, but make sure to come back.\"\n\"Okay, thank you, Sunak. Drexel, do you want to come?\" Arix asked her brother, who was sitting next to Sunak.\n\"No way!\" Drexel replied, eyeing the man eating insect legs with disgust. He didn’t even want to be near it.\nSeeing Drexel’s reluctance, Arix didn’t insist and flew over to the birdmen’s platform by herself.\nThe birdmen were friendly and greeted her warmly when they saw a young Tiger clan member approaching.\nArix politely addressed them. When she reached Liaka, she sweetly said, \"Nice meeting you, sir.\"\nLiaka might have looked a bit wild, but he had a gentle demeanor. He smiled kindly and said, \"I remember you’re the new pureblood of the Tiger clan, Airx, right?\"\nArix nodded, \"Yes Thank you for inviting me over.\"\nLiaka nodded with a smile. \"Good girl. Would you like to try some food? It’s freshly grilled.\"\nHe handed her a plate with grilled insect legs.\n\"Thank you,\" Arix said politely. She eyed the insect legs on the plate.\nIf she didn’t know they were insectoid legs, she might have thought they were grilled king crab legs. But these were much thicker; while a king crab leg was about the thickness of a finger, this insectoid leg was as thick as an arm.\nArix was cautious about trying insectoid meat for the first time. She sniffed it tentatively and was greeted with a fragrant barbecue smell.\nOnce she was sure the scent was good, she took a small bite and chewed slowly.\nThe meat was tender and delicious, with a texture similar to king crab legs. The grilling had given it a smoky flavor that made it even more enjoyable.\n\"Delicious!\" Arix exclaimed, her eyes sparkling with excitement as she looked up at Liaka.\n\"Finish this, and I’ll grill some more for you,\" Liaka said gently, his eyes shining with genuine kindness.\nSeeing the young Tiger clan member enjoying the food so much, the birdmen around them showed even more goodwill.\nMany of them, proud of their cooking skills, brought out various insectoid delicacies for Arix to try.\nFinding someone from another clan who enjoyed insectoid food was a rare delight for the birdmen, and they were thrilled to share their culinary creations.\nArix’s enthusiasm and open-mindedness won her many new friends among the birdmen. They were pleased to see someone appreciate their food without hesitation.\nAs the celebration was about to begin and Arix needed to return, many birdmen expressed their reluctance to see her go.\n\"Arix, come back and see us if you want to eat more next time!\" one of the birdmen said warmly.\n\"Okay, thank you, everyone,\" Arix waved her paw in farewell and then flew back to the Tiger clan’s platform.",

      "content": "Chapter 148: Sylvana Dance\nArix returned to the Tiger clan’s high platform just as the blessing ceremony kicked off.\nThe first step? Inviting the gods.\nAlpha Leonidas, decked out in pure white ceremonial robes, stood front and center on the sacrificial platform. Behind him was a priest in similar ceremonial garb.\nAnother priest respectfully handed three white flowers to Alpha Leonidas and then stepped back.\nTaking the lit flowers, Alpha Leonidas bowed three times to the Sylvana statue, holding the flowers to his chest. With deep reverence, he began reading the sacrificial text.\n\"Revered Moon Goddess Sylvana, heart of heaven and earth, destiny of all beings, bringer of eternal peace. Your mighty influence benefits all generations. I humbly follow the heavenly order, offering this sacrifice with respect. I pray for our nation’s everlasting peace. May you enjoy this offering!\"\nHis powerful voice echoed like a chant across the Moon Goddess mountain top. As he finished, every member of the Empire dropped to one knee, placing their right hands over their hearts, and shouted earnestly toward the Sylvana statue, \"Sylvana, please grant us your blessings!\"\nWith the god-inviting step complete, Alpha Leonidas left the platform. Next up was offering the sacrifices.\n\"Present the offerings!\" the Pontifex announced loudly. Priests moved in waves, placing the offerings in front of the Sylvana statue.\nOnce the offerings were in place, it was time for the third step: the Pontifex’s sacrificial dance.\n\"Present the Sylvana Dance!\" called the Pontifex. Scion, dressed in pure white robes, slowly approached the Moon Goddess statue, holding a branch of phoenix flowers.\nFrom the moment Scion appeared, Arix couldn’t take her eyes off him. Usually the aloof admiral, Scion now seemed like a celestial being. His white robes and unbound flowing white hair gave him an ethereal look.\nAs the music started, Scion began to dance, moving with divine grace. The phoenix flower branch in his hand seemed to come alive, swirling around him.\nHis robes flowed, making it appear as if he might lift off and return to the heavens. He moved so lightly it seemed like he was floating.\nAs Scion danced, countless tiny white glowing points began to fall from the sky. Sunak gently nudged Arix and her brother forward, smiling. \"Now you can go to the sacrificial platform.\"\nArix and Drexel exchanged a glance, nodded, and walked toward the platform. They weren’t alone; countless young members of the Empire were also moving closer. As they approached, the glowing points from the sky rushed toward them.\nArix watched, fascinated, as the small glowing points entered her body. She felt warm and cozy, almost sleepy.\nArix’s eyes slowly closed as the small glowing points swirled around her.\nBy the time she reached the sacrificial platform, she was enveloped in a radiant cluster of light. That light lifted her into the air, drawing even more glowing points toward her.\nAll around, the young ones experienced the same phenomenon, each encased in a glowing orb and hovering in mid-air.\nAs the sky stopped showering the glowing points, Scion’s dance reached its final moments.\nHolding the phoenix flower branch to his chest, he finished his dance.\nBefore leaving, he glanced back at Arix’s glowing cluster, then turned and exited the sacrificial platform.\nAs the young ones received the blessings of the Moon Goddess, the people below buzzed with conversations about the new Pontifex at this ceremony.\n\"The Pontifex who danced just now wasn’t the usual one, but he was truly impressive. This year’s blessings from the Moon Goddess are more abundant than ever.\"\n\"I know, he’s Scion, the admiral of the Tiger Legion. I’ve heard he’s the next Pontifex.\"\n\"That explains it. No wonder he’s part of this year’s blessing ceremony.\"\n\"Still, it’s curious why he’s here this year.\"\nAmidst the chatter, some young ones on the sacrificial platform began to wake up.\nUpon landing, they followed the pontifex to a room, where they transformed from beast form to human form and re-tested their physical and psychic power levels.\nThe blessings from the Moon Goddess could enhance their abilities to some extent.\nDrexel was among the first to wake up. Since he didn’t need to transform, he went straight to testing his abilities.\nAs he placed his hand on the testing device, two lines representing his physical power and psychic power appeared on the screen.\nPsychic power: Supergiant Class.\nPhysical power: Supergiant+ Class.\nThe priest conducting the test looked at Drexel with a bit of surprise but said nothing. Drexel himself was pleasantly surprised. He had just come to the Empire for the blessing ceremony and ended up with an unexpected boost. He couldn’t help but feel delighted.\nAfter politely thanking the testing priest, Drexel returned to the Tiger clan’s high platform.\n\"So, how did it go? Did your abilities increase?\" Krylak asked eagerly.\nDrexel grinned widely and nodded. \"My physical power increased by one level. I’m now a Supergiant+!\"\nKrylak immediately raised his thumb in joy, and the surrounding members of the Tiger clan followed suit, all giving Drexel a thumbs-up.\nIf Drexel could achieve such excellence, the pureblood, Arix, should be able to have even more extraordinary potential.\nWith this in mind, the anticipation for Arix’s results grew even stronger among the Tiger clan members.\nArix, thinking she was still inside the cluster of light, slowly opened her eyes. She saw a giant tiger head staring right at her.\nSurprisingly, she wasn’t scared this time, maybe because she’d gotten used to these strange occurrences.\n\"Sylvana, are you out of your mind?\" the tiger roared. \"How could you possibly save them all on your own? As a divine beast, why would you stay here to die with these lesser beings instead of leaving with us?\"\nThe tiger’s anger was almost tangible as he yelled at Arix. She felt bewildered for a moment before realizing the tiger seemed to be talking to her. ’But who’s Sylvana? Isn’t she the Moon Goddess?’\n\"Excuse me, are you talking to me?\" Arix cautiously asked.\n\"Who else would I be talking to? Sylvana, have you really lost your mind?\" The tiger’s fierce expression softened slightly, revealing concern in his eyes.",

      "content": "Chapter 149: Ancient Stories\nOnce she confirmed the tiger was indeed addressing her, Arix held her face with her paws, staring in horror.\n’Am I dreaming, or did I somehow transmigrate again?’\nDesperately, she called out in her mind, \"Cupid, Vita, Sophia, are you there? What’s going on? This is terrifying!\"\nBut there was no response from her psychic world. Instead, the tiger scratched its head, puzzled. \"Sylvana, did you just call me?\"\nArix shook her head wildly. She had clearly been calling for Sophia and the others!\n\"That’s strange. I could have sworn you were calling me, but you didn’t say a word. Must be my imagination,\" the tiger muttered, looking around to confirm they were alone.\nThe next moment, the tiger felt the strange sensation again, as if Sylvana was calling out to him.\nStaring suspiciously at Arix, the tiger saw no movement from her mouth but still felt the presence of a call. He began to check the surroundings, frowning.\nArix, meanwhile, was too frightened to make a sound. Yet she realized that whenever she called out to Sophia and the others, the tiger would react.\n’what’s going on?’\nshe wondered.\nAs she tried to think, an answer suddenly popped into her head. The tiger before her was actually Cupid, Vita, and Sophia merged into one soul instead of being split into three.\nThis revelation made Arix’s eyes widen in shock. If she was right, the current time was likely before the first great disaster on ancient Earth. And the Moon Goddess Sylvana was probably her past self!\nArix wanted to deny it, but her mind kept providing the same answer: she was indeed the reincarnation of Sylvana. Both Arix in the interstellar age and Sylvana from ancient Earth shared the same soul.\nRealizing the gravity of the situation, Arix felt like her world was crumbling. She had somehow become the mastermind behind the separation of her grandparents, and the Moon Goddess Temple was built for her!\nAs she struggled with these revelations, the roaring tiger returned from his fruitless search, He shook his head in frustration. \"Sylvana, there’s no time left. You must come with me now. The great disaster will strike at dusk, and if we don’t leave, it’ll be too late.\"\nSeeing Sylvana (Arix) still unresponsive, the tiger roared in frustration, \"You’re still thinking about those low-level beings, aren’t you? Why are you so stubborn? We are divine gods. We can escape to safety and create new life forms!\"\nArix felt torn. She wanted to leave, but those so-called low-level beings were probably her ancestors! She couldn’t just abandon them.\nDespite her inner turmoil, she looked at the concerned tiger and sighed. \"You go! Don’t worry about me. I have a way to save them.\"\n\"You have a way? What way? Those who are even more powerful than us have already left. They couldn’t save anyone, so what makes you think you can?\" The tiger was beyond frustrated, almost desperate.\nIf he could overpower Sylvana, he would have knocked her out and taken her away in a sack.\n\"I’m not leaving. Go on your own,\" Arix insisted.\n\"Fine! Don’t regret it later,\" the tiger growled and stormed off.\nWatching the tiger’s retreating figure, Arix sighed deeply. She doubted he would actually leave. If he did, how would Cupid and the others end up in her psychic world later? She wondered what he had done for her in her past life.\nArix closed her eyes, deep in thought. She recalled what the Pontifex had once said. In their time of despair, the divine Sylvana appeared. She sacrificed her power to create a moon boat, transferring all remaining life on ancient Earth to the safety. That exhausted her divine power and she fell into a deep sleep.\n’In essence, I have to deplete my power to save my ancestors, moving them to other planets.’\nThe solution sprang to Arix’s mind without much thought: sacrifice herself to save the world. Offer Sylvana’s power to give all living beings on ancient Earth a chance to survive.\nIf the future of this world had nothing to do with her, Arix wouldn’t even consider such a selfless act. But now, knowing her connection to this world, she felt a strange sense of responsibility.\nWith a heavy heart, she acknowledged the solution. The idea of sacrificing herself was overwhelming, but if it meant saving her ancestors and securing the future, she couldn’t ignore it.\nArix felt a mix of resolve and dread. She was about to embark on a path that would change the fate of countless beings, including her own.\nBut as Arix considered the immense sacrifice ahead, her mind drifted to the future, to the interstellar era where she had her grandfather, father, mother, Drexel, Cirilla, Cassian, Scion, Sister Gwen... Thinking of all her family and friends, Arix let out a deeper sigh.\nSince the sacrifice couldn’t be avoided, Arix decided to savor her final moments. It would be nice to see the landscapes of ancient Earth one last time.\nArix slowly walked away from the sacrificial platform, her heart heavy but resolute. She wandered through the lush forests, feeling the ancient trees’ rough bark and the soft moss beneath her feet.\nThe air was filled with the scent of wildflowers and the distant calls of unknown birds, a symphony of life she had never experienced in the interstellar age.\nShe made her way to a nearby river, its crystal-clear waters flowing gently over smooth stones. Kneeling by the riverbank, Arix dipped her fingers into the cool water, watching the ripples dance away.\nShe closed her eyes and listened to the soothing sound of the water, letting it calm her racing thoughts.\nThe sun began to set, casting a warm golden glow over the landscape.\nArix climbed a hill to get a better view, standing on its peak as she watched the sky blaze with colors. Reds, oranges, and purples painted the heavens, a stunning farewell from the world she was about to leave behind.",

      "content": "Chapter 150: Sacrifice\n\"Another one’s lost it,\" someone sighed.\n\"Well, it is the end of the world. How can anyone stay sane?\"\n\"Is it really, though? I thought it was just that the spiritual energy had decreased lately.\"\n\"Lord Dragon returned to the clan today. Do you think he’s lying?\"\n\"What about the gods we worship? Are they really going to just leave us behind?\"\n\"Hah, leave us behind? They only care about themselves. I heard they’ve all left. We’re the only ones still here—us common Celesterrors.\"\n\"That’s unbelievable! We offered the Moon Goddess and the others all sorts of delicacies every day. Now they don’t care if we live or die, and they didn’t even warn us.\"\n\"Do you think they’d have the nerve to say anything? I’m just upset about all the offerings. That was our entire tribe saving and scrimping!\"\n\"Aren’t we all? All those offerings... we might as well have fed them to worms.\"\nAs the two Celesterrors strolled through the forest, they grumbled about the hypocritical gods.\nOnce they were out of sight, Arix emerged from behind a tree.\n\"Looks like the Celesterrors are getting the news,\" Arix muttered, then moved forward to see more of what was happening.\nThe sudden disappearance of the gods had caused even the lower-ranking Celesterrors to sense something was off.\nAfter asking around, they were plunged into despair. Some were collapsing, some were swearing, and others were weeping.\nArix moved quietly, witnessing the hopelessness among the Celesterrors.\nThose who had accepted their fate were silently saying goodbye to their friends and family. Others, in sheer panic, began to harm themselves—plucking their fur, tearing off their scales, or bashing their heads against trees until they bled.\nSeeing this chaos, Arix felt deeply troubled. She glanced up at the sky and sighed softly.\nThen, she soared into the air, transforming her small body into a gigantic full moon that appeared in the sky.\nTaking a deep breath, she addressed all living beings on the ground, \"I am Sylvana. Before dusk today, I will take you away from this place. Bring your family and friends and gather here. Remember! Come here before dusk. When the moon rises, it will be your time to leave. Do not be late!\"\nArix’s voice, filled with divine power, echoed in the ears of all living beings.\nThe Celesterrors, upon hearing the message, went from disbelief to pure joy. As soon as Arix finished speaking, the entire ancient Earth was in an uproar. All living beings began to move in a grand migration toward Arix’s location.\nArix repeated her words three times before stopping. Then she looked down.\nBy now, countless beings had already gathered below. As soon as they saw Arix, they knelt down in unison, shouting excitedly, \"Thank you, Sylvana, for saving our lives!\"\nSeeing so many Celesterrors bowing to her, Arix remained calm on the outside but felt a bit flustered inside. She couldn’t help but worry if any of her ancestors were among the kneeling Celesterrors. That would be super awkward!\nSuppressing a twitch at the corner of her mouth, Arix coughed lightly. Then she spoke majestically to the Celesterrors on the ground, \"No need to kneel. Help me calm the other beings instead.\"\nThe Celesterrors seemed to notice that Arix didn’t like such formalities. They exchanged glances before lowering their heads respectfully and saying, \"Yes.\"\nFollowing this, the leaders among the Celesterrors began to soothe and organize their groups. Before long, the once chaotic crowd of Celesterrors returned to order, and the later arrivals were properly arranged.\nArix let out a sigh of relief upon seeing the situation stabilize.\nAs dusk approached, the area within a thousand-mile radius was densely packed with beings. All of them looked up at Sylvana in the sky with hopeful eyes. This was their hope and their last lifeline.\nArix glanced at the sky, then looked down once more at the beings below. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Then, she suddenly opened her eyes and began to dance the Sylvana Dance.\nYes, it turned out that the Sylvana Dance was a sacrificial dance, but the sacrifice was Sylvana herself.\nArix’s dance wasn’t as graceful as Scion’s; in fact, it was somewhat awkward. But with each step she took, the ground beneath her lit up, making the dance appear even more sacred than a beautiful performance.\nAs Arix danced, the once serene and peaceful sky gradually turned blood-red, and the ground shook as if an earthquake were happening.\nA foreboding sense of doom hung over every being’s heart. They knew this was a sign of the impending disaster.\nThe trembling beings suppressed their instinct to flee, their hopeful gazes fixed on the sky.\nUpon seeing the white silhouette in the sky, they finally relaxed a bit. Sylvana was fighting for them, so they couldn’t afford to hold her back.\nJust before the great disaster struck, Arix finally finished the Sylvana Dance. She looked at the beings below one last time, then her lips parted, and an ancient, incomprehensible chant echoed in the sky.\n\"God of gods, mother of all, I, Sylvana, offer my blood, flesh, and soul. Let heaven bear witness, I shall not regret.\"\nAs her voice fell, every step Arix had taken during the dance began to glow brilliantly.\nIn the blink of an eye, a massive magical array formed, expanding until it enveloped all the creatures below. It only stopped once everything was covered.\nA huge moon rose from the horizon, larger than ever before. As the creatures realized what was happening, they found themselves bathed in bright moonlight, slowly lifting off the ground.\nWhen all the beings were safely transferred, the sky turned a deep blood-red. Countless meteors began tearing through the clouds, crashing toward the earth with terrifying force.\nSeeing the world now devoid of life, Arix let out a relieved sigh. Exhausted, she began to fall from the sky. As she fell, Arix—no, Sylvana’s body—started to gradually disappear.\nJust when Arix thought she would die alone, a distant tiger’s roar echoed through the sky.\n\"Sylvana, you idiot! Your solution was to sacrifice yourself? Are you out of your mind!!\"\nArix heard a noise and strained to look over her shoulder, only to see a tiger charging desperately towards her. Tears welled up in her eyes for reasons she couldn’t understand, and she whispered, \"Cupid...\"\nJust before she hit the ground, the tiger caught her. As Arix’s body started to fade, panic filled the tiger’s eyes.\nIn disbelief, he asked, \"What did you sacrifice? Where is your soul? Why is it disappearing so quickly?\"\n\"Had no choice,\" Arix weakly pushed at the tiger, \"Not enough flesh and blood, had to give up my soul too. I’m dying. Leave me, go!\"\n\"Sylvana, I can’t leave you,\" the tiger said quietly, shaking his head.\n\"Are you stupid?!\" Arix, if she had the strength, would have knocked on the tiger’s head like her brother used to.\n\"You think you’re the only one who can be foolish?\" the tiger huffed.\n\"You knew you’d die.\" Arix’s vision blurred, and her voice wavered.\nThe power of the sacrifice was eating away at Sylvana’s soul. Arix felt her senses dulling, her consciousness slipping. In her last moment of awareness, she weakly murmured, \"Go... go...\"\nWhen Arix’s consciousness plunged into darkness, she found herself floating out of Sylvana’s body, now in soul form. She looked at the tiger and saw his mouth moving, chanting something.\n\"God of gods, mother of all, I offer my flesh and soul in exchange for Sylvana’s life, without regret.\"\nUnderstanding his words, Arix panicked and tried to stop him, but her soul couldn’t touch the tiger. \"No! How could you be so foolish...\" Arix cried, but it was useless.\nShe collapsed to the ground, watching helplessly as the sacrificial power consumed the tiger. Unlike Arix’s despair, the tiger seemed content, as if he had achieved his goal.\nSeeing Sylvana stop fading thanks to his sacrifice, a satisfied smile crossed his face. With his now-transparent head, he gently nuzzled Sylvana and, in a soft voice, said, \"Sylvana, you want to save the world, but I want to save you...\"\nBefore he could finish, the tiger closed his eyes and fell beside Sylvana, powerless. Arix’s eyes widened, tears streaming uncontrollably. She reached out with her transparent hand, gently touching the tiger, who had lost half of his soul.\nSeeing the tiger and Sylvana, both having lost half of their souls, Arix suddenly understood everything. \"So, the tiger and Sylvana each gave up half of their souls. That means I am both Sylvana and the tiger,\" Arix said, her voice trembling.\nShe then looked at the tiger’s soul, which seemed to be split into three parts. At that moment, something clicked for her. With a mix of crying and smiling, she called out, \"Cupid, Vita, Sophia, come back.\"\nAt her words, the tiger’s soul, which had left its lifeless body, floated out and flew into Arix’s forehead like a bird returning home.\n...",

      "content": "Chapter 151: The New Arix\nThe instant the souls merged, Arix woke up on the sacrificial altar.\nStill shaken from her recent despair, she took a moment to gather herself.\nThe priest nearby didn’t seem to notice Arix’s distant gaze. With a detached expression, he said, \"Follow me.\"\nArix, still dazed, looked at him for a moment before her eyes regained focus. She silently nodded and then glanced back at the bustling crowd below the altar. A sense of relief washed over her as she saw their joyous faces.\nThis world was at peace, and the people were safe.\nArix smiled softly before turning away and leaving the sacrificial altar. She quietly followed the priest to a room.\nHe opened a wardrobe and said, \"Go inside and transform into your human form. Do you have clothes?\"\n\"Thank you, pontifex. Yes, I do,\" Arix replied politely.\n\"Good, go on in. I’ll wait outside,\" he said, his attitude softening at Arix’s politeness.\nArix nodded and entered the wardrobe room alone. It was simple, with just a changing area and a full-length mirror. She stood before the mirror, silently looking at her tiger form.\n\"Cupid, Vita, Sophia,\" she called out in her mind.\nThis time, they responded quickly. Cupid appeared first, worriedly asking, \"Arix, what’s wrong? You seem upset.\"\nVita and Sophia, sensing Arix’s distress, also emerged from the psychic world. Seeing the three small tigers sitting in a row, Arix’s nose tingled, and tears streamed down her face.\nHer vulnerability startled Cupid and the others. They quickly surrounded her, even Sophia awkwardly trying to comfort her. \"Don’t cry. Tell us who hurt you, and we’ll beat them up,\" Sophia offered.\n\"Yeah! Whoever dares to bully Arix, we’ll fight them!\" Cupid said, waving her paws angrily.\nVita said nothing, gently patting Arix, but the murderous glint in her eyes was the most frightening of all.\nArix, feeling deeply moved, nuzzled the three little tigers and said, her voice choked with emotion, \"No one dared to bully me. I just missed you all so much.\"\nHer affectionate words made the three tigers blush instantly.\nCupid, in particular, started spinning in circles out of happiness, moving so fast that he became a blur.\nSophia turned her head away, her face flushed, and said with a proud tone, \"Next time you miss us, just tell us directly. No need to hold it in.\"\nVita, sensing that Arix might be crying for another reason, chose to stay silent and not spoil the moment.\nArix nodded, wiped her tears, and changed the topic with a smile, \"I just received the blessing, and now I can transform back. Cupid, do you want to see?\"\nThe three little tigers exchanged glances, their eyes shining with excitement as they all said in unison, \"We do!\"\nArix’s lips curved into a gentle smile as she looked at the three little ones and said, \"Wait for me a bit.\" Then, she turned and went into the small cubicle.\n\"What do you think Arix will look like when she gets her human form back?\" Cupid asked, feeling both bored and curious, glancing at her two companions.\n\"No idea, but she definitely won’t look the same as before. After all, her therian genes have been unlocked,\" Sophia replied with her usual calmness.\n\"I bet she’ll have features of the Tiger clan, like silver hair as bright as the moon and blue eyes like the sky,\" Vita said with a soft smile.\n\"Well, that’s a given for the Tiger clan. No need to guess that. I’m wondering if Arix’s ears will turn into beast ears. That would be so cute!\" Cupid wiggled her little butt in excitement.\nSophia and Vita imagined it for a moment and then both swallowed, giving a unanimous response, \"That would be nice! Tiger ears are the cutest.\"\nTheir imaginations went a bit further, and they all ended up picturing a flat chest.\nThe three little ones exchanged glances, instantly understanding each other’s thoughts. Then they all sighed in unison.\n\"Arix will definitely still be flat-chested,\" Cupid sighed regretfully.\n\"It would be nice if she had a bit of Luna Amethyst’s genes,\" Sophia said, thinking of the woman with a generous bosom, feeling a bit envious on Arix’s behalf.\n\"Flat is good too, at least it won’t be a burden in a fight,\" Vita tried to console with positive words.\n\"True, at least she saves on fabric,\" Sophia added, trying to suppress her guilty conscience.\n\"And she won’t have to worry about being squished while sleeping,\" Cupid said, tears streaming down her face like a waterfall, sympathetically.\nJust then, as the three little ones were still chatting, the door to the small cubicle opened.\nThe three little tigers immediately straightened up, sitting obediently with innocent, pure looks on their faces, staring at the cubicle.\nWhen Arix walked out, their eyes widened in shock.\n’Who is this little fairy?’\nArix, rarely seen in a long dress, had her silver-moon-colored hair cascading down like cloud, elegantly tied up with a noble ribbon. She looked both graceful and coldly stunning.\nHer blue eyes, like ice crystals, seemed to ripple like water, captivating anyone with a single glance, like the deep-sea mermen.\nHer nose, firm and straight, had the delicate beauty of a woman with a hint of masculine boldness.\nHer slightly thin, soft cherry lips were a vivid gem-like red, more delicate and bright than the petals of the most beautiful rose.\n\"How do I look? Pretty?\" Arix asked, her fair little face smiling.\nHer big eyes curved slightly, like the afternoon sun, dazzling enough to make one feel a bit dazed.\nArix’s stunning appearance, paired with her melodious voice, left the three little ones completely enchanted. They gazed at her, practically dropping their jaws.\n\"Even if she’s a bit flat, she’s so beautiful that it doesn’t matter,\" Cupid said, holding her face with both paws, eyes full of red hearts.\n\"Yeah, definitely,\" Vita added, blushing and coughing lightly.\n\"Right,\" Sophia stammered, her face turning red.\n\"What are you whispering about?\" Arix asked, looking at the three little ones suspiciously, sensing they weren’t up to any good.\nCupid, Vita, and Sophia exchanged guilty glances and then shook their heads vigorously, denying in unison, \"Nothing, nothing at all. We weren’t talking.\"\n\"Really? Maybe I misheard. Cupid, Vita, Sophia, go back to the psychic world. I need to go out,\" Arix said, thinking about the pontifex waiting outside and not wanting to delay any further.\n\"Okay,\" they replied and quickly retreated to the psychic world as if chased by devils.\nThis obvious guilty behavior made Arix narrow her eyes and raise an eyebrow in thought. It seemed they were indeed talking about her behind her back. But she let it go, thinking how cute they were.\nArix shook her head and opened the door, stepping out. \"Sorry to keep you waiting,\" she said with a smile.\n\"No problem, let’s go,\" the priest said, eyes widening in awe at Arix’s beauty before his face turned pale. He stammered his words and then hurriedly led the way, as if chased by a devil.\nArix was utterly confused.\n’Why does he seem afraid of me?’\n...\nArix walked into the testing room.\nSeeing another person enter, the elder priest in the testing room first admired the girl’s looks and then smiled warmly. \"Place your hand here, please.\"\n\"Okay,\" Arix nodded politely and placed her hand on the testing device. The device scanned her hand with a purple light, absorbing a bit of her psychic power.\nShortly after, the virtual screen displayed the words \"testing in progress.\"\nSoon, the screen showed two lines of results representing physical power and psychic power.\nPsychic Power: Supergiant++\nPhysical Power: Supergiant Class\nSeeing the line for her psychic power, Arix frowned slightly in displeasure.\n’Why did my psychic power increase again? Is that really a good thing?’\nHowever, her physical power seemed more unpredictable, having impressively risen by two levels!\nLooking at her physical power, Arix felt a bit of comfort in her otherwise bad mood.\nShe nodded in satisfaction, deciding to treat herself to some delicious food as a reward for her new achievements.",

      "content": "Chapter 152: Joining The Moon Goddess Temple\nArix stayed calm, but the old priest beside her was so shocked he stood up. He rubbed his eyes and checked the screen several times to make sure he wasn’t mistaken.\n\"Young lady, would you consider joining us at the Moon Goddess Temple?\" The old priest, looking excited, couldn’t hold back his invitation.\nArix’s face darkened as she decisively shook her head. \"Sorry, I’m a soldier of the Alliance.\"\n\"No problem, the Moon Goddess Temple doesn’t mind,\" the old priest said with shining eyes. Not only didn’t he mind Alliance soldiers, he wouldn’t even mind a spy.\nArix’s mouth twitched, thinking, \"Just because you don’t mind doesn’t mean I don’t.\"\nSeeing that the old priest wasn’t going to give up easily, Arix decided to use her trump card.\n\"I’m already in love,\" Arix said, her face showing a shy and hesitant expression.\nThe old priest choked a little. But considering Arix’s talent, he still probed, \"Can you break up?\"\nArix was speechless.\nConsidering the priest’s earnest attitude, she might have really fallen for it. But sorry, she didn’t want to spend the rest of her life loveless.\nArix cursed inwardly, but had to keep up the appearance of a love-struck fool.\nShe cried out dramatically, \"No, without him I can’t live. I love him so so much. We have the sweetest love in the world. I want to be with him forever!\"\nArix forced herself to say those mushy things, feeling like she was going to throw up.\nShe wasn’t sure if she had grossed out the priest, but she certainly had herself.\nEven though these love-struck words almost made Arix puke, the old priest seemed touched, lost in memories of his youth.\nAfter a long sigh, he said regretfully, \"There was once a love before me that I didn’t cherish. Young lady, maybe you’re right! Brave love, go for it! Good luck!\"\nArix awkwardly smiled, \"Thank you so much! I’ll be going now! Goodbye, sir!\"\nAfter thanking him, Arix didn’t wait for the old priest’s response and fled the room as if chased by ghosts.\nShe ran too fast, not paying attention to her surroundings, so she suddenly collided with someone.\nA bit stunned, Arix looked up to see Scion’s face, as if carved from ice and snow.\n\"Scion? What are you doing here?\" Arix blinked, curious.\nHearing the voice, Scion looked over, surprised to see the beautiful and otherworldly face of a young woman.\nScion’s eyes showed a hint of surprise, but he quickly composed himself, helping Arix to stand. He cleared his throat and said, \"I was waiting to go back with you.\"\n\"Oh, that’s sweet. Scion, you’re so nice,\" Arix said.\nScion’s lips curved into a faint smile as he gently ruffled Arix’s hair, like he always did. \"It’s getting late. Let’s head back.\"\n\"Okay.\" Arix nodded. The two of them headed back to the Tiger clan’s platform.\nAs they appeared before the crowd, a hush fell over the area. The Empire people, who had been chatting and joking, froze at the sight of them. Some dropped what they were holding, some rubbed their eyes in disbelief, and a few even fainted for no apparent reason.\nArix was initially confused, but after glancing at Scion’s strikingly handsome face, she understood.\nArix didn’t realize she was also causing a stir. She had spent a long period looking gaunt and skeletal, so she thought her appearance was ordinary and wouldn’t cause such a reaction.\nScion, looking at the beautiful Arix beside him, assumed it was her causing the commotion. He pulled her closer protectively, not suspecting himself at all. He had always had a strained relationship with strangers—men either envied or resented him, and women tended to avoid him once they knew his identity, as if being near him would bring misfortune.\nIf anyone knew what the two of them were thinking, they would laugh at this absurdity, since they were clearly blind to the reality of their own attractiveness.\nWhen they reached the Tiger clan’s platform, Arix was surprised to see Cassian there as well. Cassian initially cast a disdainful glance at Scion, then quickly switched to a charming smile, looking at Arix in awe. \"Arix, you look even more beautiful than before.\"\nCassian’s attractive smile and gentle expression made him seem like a breath of fresh spring air, warm and vibrant like the sun.\n\"Thank you, Cassian.\" Arix was pleasantly surprised but happy to see him.\nCassian’s smile was kind, but his tone carried a hint of subtle mockery as he asked, \"Scion, what are you doing here? The ceremony isn’t over yet, is it?\"\nIt was as if he was reminding Scion to be mindful of his age and status and not to harbor inappropriate thoughts.\nScion’s eyes turned icy. He knew Cassian was deliberately reminding him of his future role as the Pontifex.\nScion’s mind played with a cold, amused smile, but his face stayed calm and indifferent. \"You Highness, only the current Pontifex can end the ceremony. And unfortunately, I am not the Pontifex yet. You’re still young, Your Highness. You still have a lot to learn.\"\nCassian’s smile stiffened. His biggest sore spot was his youth, with his face and body not yet fully developed. That’s why Arix never had that kind of interest in him. Even if he flaunted his looks, Arix only saw him as a handsome little boy.\nCassian suddenly felt a pang of jealousy for his father’s broad shoulders and eight-pack abs. Whenever his father showed off, his mother would gaze at him with starry eyes, unable to look away.\nHe pinched his still-soft stomach, feeling even more dejected. Looking at the defeated young wolf, Scion’s lips finally curved with a hint of satisfaction.\nArix stood off to the side, sneaking a glance at Cassian and then at Scion. The sudden silence between them felt heavy.\nShe couldn’t shake the feeling that Cassian and Scion had somehow slipped into some sort of combat mode. The tense air around them was so thick it scared off the nearby Tiger Clan members, who didn’t dare approach Arix to question her test results.\nOnly Drexel, always the carefree one, walked over and threw an arm around Arix’s shoulder, grinning widely. \"Wow, Arix! You’ve really blossomed!\"\n\"Nothing special, just average. By the way, have you upgraded your psychic or physical power levels?\" Arix appreciated beauty in others but was immune to her own.\n\"Yep, I did. I’m now a Supergiant+.\" Drexel’s smug smile made him look like he was asking for a punch.\n\"Psychic power?\" Arix asked, intrigued.\n\"You think upgrading psychic power is easy? It’s not like picking apples. I only managed to level up my physical power.\" Drexel tried to sound humble, but the pride was obvious.\nArix secretly rolled her eyes at Drexel, who looked ready to float away with pride, but she still clapped politely. \"Drexel, that’s amazing. So your physical power is Supergiant+ now. I don’t think anyone in the Alliance has reached that level yet.\"\n\"Keep it low-key, Arix. What about you?\" Drexel asked, looking hopeful.\nHearing this, the nearby Tiger Clan members perked up, listening intently.\n\"I leveled up too. My physical power is now Supergiant-Class. You don’t have to worry about me anymore.\" Arix smiled with a sibling’s warmth.\nFrom now on, she wouldn’t be in life-threatening danger because of her physical power.\nDrexel was momentarily stunned, then he pulled Arix into a tight hug, murmuring with pride, \"Arix, I’m so proud of you.\"\nUnbeknownst to Arix, Drexel’s relieved heart caused his once calm psychic world to stir.\nSheer, who was napping in Drexel’s psychic world, felt the shift. He opened his eyes, glanced around, but then he sighed, and went back to sleep. \"This place is expanding.\"\nAfter the blessing ceremony, Arix and the others took a beast-drawn carriage back. Unlike the journey there, the atmosphere in the carriage was now awkwardly quiet.\nArix glanced to her left at Cassian, then to her right at Scion.\nInwardly, she cursed Sunak for being so sneaky. No wonder there had been an empty seat earlier, yet he didn’t sit with them.\nHe must have seen this coming.\nAnd these two, obviously at odds, still chose to sit together. Why?\nFortunately, Drexel, blissfully unaware, broke the silence. He looked at Cassian curiously and asked, \"You’re the crown prince of the Empire, right? Is it really okay for you to just come along with us?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 153: Leaving The Empire\nScion lifted his gaze to Cassian, clear disdain in his eyes.\nCassian believed that if he didn’t show any embarrassment, the awkwardness would fall on others.\nIgnoring the stares, he turned his face to a more flattering angle and, while answering Drexel, he kept his eyes on Arix. \"I’ve already gotten my parents’ permission. Besides, Arix is heading back to the Alliance tomorrow. As her closest and most trusted friend, how could I miss her farewell party?\"\nHis words sounded perfectly reasonable, and Arix was genuinely touched. She responded warmly, \"Thank you, Cassian. You’re my best and dearest friend too, and Scion, you’re like a brother to me.\"\nCassian’s heart sank; he felt like he had shot himself in the foot.\n’Does Arix misunderstand something?’\nHe wanted a relationship far beyond mere friendship!\nScion, watching the whole scene unfold, looked at Cassian with a hint of glee. The mocking curve of his lips was the most irritating part. Cassian, feeling a vein pop on his forehead, mouthed sarcastically at Scion, \"Brother.\"\nScion ignored Cassian’s sarcasm; he only needed to keep an eye on this budding romance, ensuring Arix wasn’t led astray.\nCassian, on the other hand, was irked that a male who was as powerful as him kept hovering around Arix. That made him feel threatened. Thus, the two began exchanging hostile glances again.\nArix, the focus of their rivalry, was somewhat used to their antics. Weren’t she worried about being rude, she might have pulled out some cookies to munch on while enjoying the show.\nAfter returning to the Tiger clan, Arix had no time to dwell on these matters.\nThe farewell banquet hosted by the clan was the grandest event in recent years, with every clan member who could make it in attendance.\nAs the stars of the day, the siblings were made to drink quite a bit.\nArix didn’t hold her liquor well; her head was spinning when Cassian suddenly took her by the wrist and gestured towards the balcony.\nThinking Cassian had something to say, Arix followed without resistance.\nOn the balcony, Arix pressed her temples, surprised by how potent the alcohol felt, even with her physical and psychic power struggling to cope.\n\"Arix...\" Cassian, having drunk quite a bit himself, blushed as he awkwardly called her name.\n\"Hm?\" Arix responded softly, looking at Cassian with confusion, patiently waiting for him to speak.\nIn the moonlight, Arix’s face looked almost divine, like a goddess. Her clear, delicate eyes added an extra layer of beauty. Cassian was instantly captivated, his cheeks flushing red, and the shyness in his golden eyes deepening.\n\"Um, I was thinking... since you’re going back to the Alliance... I wanted to ask you... if you...\" Cassian awkwardly began, his voice shaking with nervousness. But before he could finish, a cold voice interrupted.\n\"Arix, Drexel is looking for you,\" Scion’s chilly tone cut through the night.\nScion stood at the balcony door, staring coldly at Cassian, his gaze full of warning.\nArix, tipsy from the night’s drinks, missed the thick tension between Scion and Cassian.\nWhen she knew Drexel was looking for her, she hesitated, remembering Cassian had something to say.\nTurning back to him, she asked, \"Cassian, what did you want to tell me?\"\nCassian forced a smile, hiding his inner turmoil. \"Nothing important. Just wanted to remind you to be safe heading back tomorrow.\"\n\"Thanks,\" Arix replied, wincing from her headache. She decided to find Drexel as soon as she could before crashing in her room for the night.\nOnce Arix left, the balcony’s air turned icy. Cassian’s smile vanished as he glared at Scion with cold, golden eyes. \"The mighty Empire Admiral and future Pontifex of the Moon Goddess Temple, have feelings for someone? Guess how people would react to that?\"\n\"Prince Cassian, mind your words. Arix is like a sister to me,\" Scion replied, his gaze equally frosty.\nCassian scoffed, \"A sister? Arix might see you as a brother, but do you really only see her that way?\" His tone dripped with sarcasm as he locked eyes with Scion.\nScion paused, then said calmly, \"Rest assured, Your Highness, Arix is just a sister to me.\"\nBefore Scion could finish, Cassian unleashed a terrifying psychic blast, slamming Scion against the wall. Scion crumpled to the ground, groaning but didn’t retaliate. Instead, he wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth in silence.\n\"Scion, if you like her, go after her boldly. Even if I lose to you, I’ll accept it. But who are you fooling with this pitiful act? I’m glad Arix only sees you as a brother. If she fell for someone like you now, it would be almost insulting,\" Cassian spat bitterly before storming off the balcony.\nOut of Scion’s sight, Cassian smirked to himself. He was sure that Arix would surely only have eyes for him in the future.\nHe couldn’t allow Scion to keep playing the martyr in front of her. If Scion ever became Arix’s chosen one, where would Cassian find solace?\nAfter Cassian left, Scion remained on the balcony alone. He opened his palm and quietly stared at the red mark in the center.\nThen, he looked up at the full moon in the sky, and Cassian’s words echoed in his mind. Yes, it wasn’t others holding him back, it was himself.\nBut what use was it to know that? He couldn’t even guarantee his own future, let alone someone else’s. Instead of hurting her in the end, it was better to hide away.\nThe next day...\nArix and Drexel were saying goodbye to the people of the Tiger Clan.\n\"Drexel, Arix, make sure to come back to the Empire during your break!\" Krylak said, his eyes misty with tears, clearly reluctant to see them go.\n\"Sure,\" the siblings nodded obediently, afraid that Krylak might start crying at any moment.\n\"These two Space Buttons are gifts from the clan. Just accept them. Don’t say no to me,\" Krylak said as he thrust the buttons into their hands, not giving them a chance to refuse.\nArix and Drexel exchanged glances, feeling awkward but accepting the gifts.\nSeeing that they accepted, Krylak felt much happier. If they had said no to his love, it would have hurt his feelings.\n\"Alright, I won’t keep you any longer. Be safe on your journey,\" Krylak said, his voice choked with emotion.\nThe siblings, feeling a bit overwhelmed by the Tiger Clan’s emotional farewell, quickly said their goodbyes and headed on their way back to the Alliance.\n...\nIn the space station...\nArix sat quietly in the waiting area, reading her mecha extracurricular book while waiting for Drexel to buy the tickets. However, a lone beauty often attracted unwanted attention. At that moment, two sleazy therian men approached her, looking to make a move.\n\"Hey there. It must be lonely all by yourself. How about some company?\" they said, their intentions clear from their lecherous eyes.\nArix initially didn’t want to bother with these pests, but as they got closer, the air around her seemed to grow more foul. She looked up coldly and said, \"Leave in three seconds, and I’ll let you go intact.\"\nThe two therians were stunned for a moment before laughing. Arix’s harmless appearance made them doubt she could be any threat.\nIn fact, they looked even more excited after hearing her words.\nWhen they stepped within a meter of her, Arix lifted her hand indifferently. With a swift downward motion, two terrifying waves of psychic power slammed the therians heavily onto the ground.\nLooking at the two who would definitely need a year to recover, Arix nodded in satisfaction. She then resumed reading her mecha book.\nArix’s swift action sent a clear message, causing several therian men who had thought about intervening to reconsider and stay quiet. The commotion quickly drew the attention of a few police officers.\nAfter reviewing the footage and talking to witnesses, the officers pieced together the story.\nWorried that Arix might be shaken, they approached her to offer some reassurance.\n\"Thank you, but I’m okay. My brother will be back soon,\" Arix said, blinking her eyes politely in gratitude.\nDespite her reassurances, the officers were still concerned about the seemingly fragile young woman. They decided to have a female officer stay with Arix for added comfort and safety.\nAt first, Arix tried to decline their offer, but the determined looks on their faces made her sigh and give in. She knew Drexel would return soon, and it wouldn’t take much longer.\nSo, with the policewoman by her side, Arix continued reading her book in peace.",

      "content": "Chapter 154: Funny Flight\nNot long after, Drexel returned with two ship tickets in hand. As he approached, the policewoman scolded him, \"How could you leave your sister alone to buy tickets? Two thugs came by and harassed her!\"\nDrexel, scratching his head, looked puzzled. \"Oh, are those thugs okay? Do we need to compensate them?\"\nThe policewoman’s anger flared. She felt sorry for Arix, such a sweet girl, stuck with a clueless brother like him.\nInstead of worrying about his sister, the boy was concerned about the thugs!\nAfter some stern criticism, Drexel finally admitted he was wrong.\nSatisfied, the policewoman huffed and turned to Arix gently. \"I’ll leave now. If you run into any danger again, don’t count on your brother. Call the police right away.\"\nShe cast another disdainful glance at Drexel before shaking her head and leaving.\nArix smiled and waved goodbye to the policewoman, then she couldn’t help laughing out once she was gone.\n\"Ready to go, Mr. Unreliable?\" Arix teased, raising an eyebrow.\nDrexel was at a loss for words.\n’Why do I always get hurt in these situations? Never mind, I’ll just quietly cry for a bit.’\nFeeling rather emotional, Drexel hugged himself pitifully.\nThen, he took Arix to board the best spaceship at the space station.\nAs soon as they stepped on board, they were greeted by luxurious decorations and elegantly dressed high society folks.\nOne perk of traveling with the elite is that they usually have manners, or at least they pretend to. But this was quickly proven wrong.\nThanks to their good looks, as soon as the siblings walked through the ship’s lobby, countless wealthy businessmen and their wives turned their gazes on them with obvious interest.\nThose lecherous looks made Drexel’s face darken immediately.\nIt wasn’t entirely the businessmen’s fault. The siblings’ plain attire made them look out of place on such a high-end ship.\nMoreover, every flight had its share of gold-diggers who, despite their humble origins, bought expensive tickets just to mingle with the rich.\nJust imagine, if one of them managed to hook up with a wealthy and attractive person on the ship, they could potentially climb the social status ladder dramatically.\nBecause of this frequent occurrence, the businessmen had a bit of a preconceived notion.\nIf the siblings knew they were mistaken for gold-diggers just because they weren’t flaunting wealth, they would probably want to gouge out their eyes and donate them to someone really in need.\nFrom the ship’s lobby to their cabin, Drexel noticed he was constantly ogled by numerous wealthy women. The most infuriating part was their lingering gazes on his certain, unspeakable area.\nSeeing Drexel shaking with anger, Arix secretly chuckled. She leaned in and whispered, \"If you meet a good person, start a family. If you meet an influential person, build a career. If you meet a wealthy woman, you get both. Why don’t you just go along with it?\"\nThe more Drexel listened, the darker his expression became, almost ready to give his sister a lesson in love. But then, a thought crossed his mind, and he smirked, letting out a cold laugh.\nHe immediately switched to a tender, lovelorn expression, gazing at Arix with nauseating affection.\nThis made Arix shiver. She knew her brother too well; he was about to cause a scene.\nSure enough, Drexel raised his pinky, gently patting Arix’s shoulder with exaggerated shyness.\nIn a high-pitched, coquettish voice, he said, \"Oh, darling, how could you say that? Aren’t I still your sweetie? Darn it, you’re so annoying!\"\nApparently not satisfied, Drexel continued in the same tone, \"Darling, I’m out here with you. Won’t your boyfriend get mad at me if he knows? What if he gets upset? I’m so scared, boo-hoo-hoo. But for you, my darling, I’m not scared at all because I love you the most, mwah!\"\nAs he said this, Drexel leaned in for a playful, macho cuddle, nearly knocking Arix over. By the time he finished, the air in the lobby had turned deathly silent, followed by the sounds of people retching.\nArix, who had taken the brunt of this display, was completely stunned. In that moment, she learned the ultimate lesson: when you’re so nauseated that you can’t throw up anymore, you’ve reached a new level of disgust.\nDrexel, sensing his performance hadn’t quite hit the mark, turned his gaze towards the vomiting businessmen and the horrified ladies in the lobby. Once again, he raised his pinky in a delicate manner and, in a syrupy voice, said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, don’t you think I’m just adorable?\"\nTo cap it off, Drexel puckered his lips and blew a disgustingly exaggerated kiss, sticking out his butt.\nSNAP... RIP...\nFinally, someone in the lobby couldn’t handle Drexel’s over-the-top antics and fell off their seats. As bodies hit the floor, the wealthy ladies and gentlemen fled back to their cabins, as if they had seen a demon in the flesh.\nLooking at the now-empty lobby, Arix gave Drexel a thumbs up and said, \"When it comes to getting people sick, you’re always the best, Drexel!\"\nDrexel narrowed his eyes, and his mischievous fingers twitched uncontrollably. Seeing Drexel about to raise his pinky again, Arix shivered and quickly apologized in terror, \"For god’s sake, stop doing that. I’m sorry for whatever I’ve done, OK?\"\nOnly then did Drexel let out a satisfied humph and continue walking toward their cabin. As he led the way, he sighed dramatically, \"I’ve sacrificed so much to protect my chastity.\"\nWhen they reached their cabin, Drexel unlocked the door and took a look around.\nThe place had two bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom, and a cozy living room. It felt like a fancy apartment, all stylish and well-decorated.\nDrexel nodded, clearly pleased with what he saw. Turning to Arix, he said, \"You hang out in the living room for a bit.\"\nArix nodded, a bit confused but silent, waiting as Drexel asked.\nDrexel headed straight to one of the bedrooms, and soon the sound of things being taken apart echoed from inside.\n\"What are you doing?\" Arix asked, unable to curb her curiosity. She peeked into the bedroom to find Drexel removing the handle of a bedside table. She blinked, wondering if Drexel was finally showing his wild side.\n\"Just hold on,\" Drexel said, his voice tight with controlled anger as he worked faster. Soon, Drexel emerged from the room holding tiny, mini-sized cameras.\nArix’s face darkened as she quickly grasped what those cameras were for. \"Can we figure out who did this?\" she asked, her voice seething.\n\"Let’s worry about that later. First, we need to find all the cameras. Arix, open the opticomputer, and I’ll guide you through it,\" Drexel said, helping Arix install an anti-surveillance app.\nThe app opened to a compass-like interface. Following the arrows, they tracked down more cameras.\nAfter a hectic search, Arix and Drexel sat in the living room, staring at the dozen or so cameras on the table. \"Should we report this?\" Arix asked, her icy eyes now glinting with anger.\n\"Not yet,\" Drexel replied, shaking his head with a cold smile. \"Whoever messed with my sister is in for some payback.\"\nArix raised an eyebrow, recognizing that Drexel was about to get crafty. But this time, she was excited. \"What do you need me to do?\" she asked, eager.\n\"Find me ten of the scariest videos, the ones with the best jump scares,\" Drexel instructed. As his fingers flew over the virtual screen, lines of code appeared in a blur.\nArix nodded and began hunting for the scariest videos she could find. Meanwhile, Drexel kept working on tracing the cameras’ owner.\nIn no time, Drexel’s virtual screen displayed details about an unfamiliar middle-aged man. He saved the man’s information and looked up at Arix. \"Arix, are you done?\"\nArix nodded. \"I’ve sent the videos to your opticomputer. Check if they’re good.\"\nDrexel reviewed the scary videos, choosing the most terrifying ones. Then, he hacked into the voyeur’s opticomputer.\nAs some indescribable files popped up, Drexel quickly looked away, muttering \"gosh\" quite a few times.\nArix remained composed, because the videos were all women’s.\nHowever, knowing their purpose still made Arix grit her teeth in anger. She looked at Drexel, eyes blazing. \"What about the videos of the victims?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 155: Videos Disappearing\n\"We’ll delete them all after we deal with him,\" Drexel assured. He wouldn’t let those videos keep circulating, knowing the harm they could cause. The resolve in his eyes grew even sharper.\n\"So, what’s your plan?\" Arix asked, her eyes gleaming with curiosity.\nDrexel hesitated, his cold demeanor faltering. \"It’s not really something for girls to hear. Just wait for the result if you’re curious.\"\nArix pouted but had a good idea of his plan. Her curiosity won out. \"Tell me, and I’ll increase your share of the potion shop profits by 5%.\"\nDrexel swallowed hard, tempted. \"You sure you want to know? It’s kinda gross.\"\n\"Spill it,\" Arix insisted, confident she could handle it.\n\"Alright, just a moment.\" Drexel adjusted the opticomputer to mute and pulled out a cloth strip from his Space Button, tying it tightly over his eyes. Arix watched silently.\n\"Arix, you can see the rest for yourself. I won’t go into detail,\" Drexel said. He opened the unspeakable files and embedded the scary videos into all the existing ones.\nOnce done, Drexel exited the opticomputer and removed the blindfold, looking at Arix. \"Got it?\"\nArix touched her nose, impressed, and gave a thumbs up. \"I heard if men got terrified while entertaining themselves... they’d have trouble getting it work ever again.\"\n\"Wow... how did you know that? But... yeah, that’s true,\" Drexel replied with a sinister smile.\nArix asked, \"Are you sure it will work?\"\n\"I’ve checked. He usually watches those files around 9 PM every night. I’ll keep a close eye on him, and once it works, I’ll call the police right away. Then I’ll destroy the videos,\" Drexel said seriously. He wasn’t one to joke about such matters.\n\"Alright, you keep an eye on him. I’m heading back to the bedroom,\" Arix said, feeling the weight of an early morning. She could use a nap.\n\"Sure, go ahead,\" Drexel replied, waving his hand. He opened his opticomputer again, and after a few quick operations, a live feed from the middle-aged man’s home surveillance system appeared on the virtual screen.\nOn a distant planet named Haranu, a neatly dressed middle-aged man slowly opened the door of his house. He scanned the room to make sure no one was there, then breathed a sigh of relief and placed his briefcase on the hall cabinet.\nShedding his disguise of a presentable suit and leather shoes, he reverted to his true self—a greasy, repulsive man.\nHe immediately headed to his secret haven. After a rough day at work, he was ready to blow off some steam in his private sanctuary.\nAn unpleasant smile crept across his face as he thought about it.\nHe quickly walked to the sofa. Unable to contain his excitement, he quickly opened his opticomputer. He projected a video from a hidden file onto a massive screen in front of him.\nAs he watched the young bodies on the screen, his excitement grew, and he began to engage in unspeakable acts.\nAs the strange and unspeakable noises in the room grew louder, the man descended into madness.\nSuddenly, with a terrifying, piercing scream, a zombie with a face full of maggots and blood appeared on the virtual screen.\nHer chin was missing, and where her eyes should have been were two horrifying blood holes.\nThe skin on her face was severely decayed, giving off a thick stench of rot and blood.\nFat, white maggots squirmed on her face, ready to drop off with the slightest movement.\nThis grotesque and terrifying scene made the man’s pupils shrink and eyes widen in fear.\nA heart-wrenching scream echoed through his secret haven but stopped abruptly. He fainted from fright, his partially clothed body looking even more ugly and disgusting.\nIn the now silent secret haven, only an appliance camera was flashing a red light. Far across billions of light-years, Drexel watched the events unfold with cold indifference.\nAfter the man passed out, Drexel, concerned for his well-being, kindly notified the interstellar police to ensure he didn’t catch a chill due to his lack of clothing.\nNot wanting to risk anything happening to him before the police arrived, Drexel watched over him diligently.\nOnce the police arrived, Drexel turned off the remote surveillance.\nWith a sense of a job well done, Drexel slipped away quietly, leaving no trace.\nWhen Arix woke up, it was already 10 PM. After freshening up, she eagerly headed to the living room.\n\"How did it go? Did we succeed?\" Arix asked, her voice filled with curiosity and urgency.\nSeeing Arix awake, Drexel put down his game controller with a smug expression. He then opened his opticomputer and turned the virtual screen towards her.\nOn the screen, numerous trending searches about the middle-aged man were displayed, their popularity rivaling even Arix’s previous gossips.\nArix quickly sat beside Drexel, scrolling through the screen with her finger.\nDominating the trending topics were all posts about the pervert with the mini cameras.\n- \"You’re being watched!\"\n- \"Camera’s in most secret places!\"\n- \"Beware of the electronic peeping Tom!\"\n- \"Cameras found in major starship cabins!\"\n- \"Haranu planet apprehends a criminal! Charged with installing nano cameras in starship cabins!\"\n- \"Man finds cameras in starship cabin. His remark? Thank goodness I don’t have a girlfriend!\"\nAs Arix scrolled down, she felt both repulsed and intrigued. By the time she finished reading, she breathed a sigh of relief, feeling like her eyes needed cleansing.\n\"So, how do you like the result?\" Drexel asked, a proud smirk on his face, like a dog waiting for praise.\nArix nodded emphatically, giving him a thumbs up. \"It’s incredibly satisfying. You did great!\"\n\"Huh!!\" Drexel laughed, flipping his hair with a self-satisfied grin.\n\"By the way, did you make sure to erase the victim’s videos?\" Arix asked, concerned about any loose ends.\n\"Once the police finalize the charges, those videos will be automatically destroyed. If anyone tries to repost them, their opticomputer will be toast,\" Drexel replied, a cold smile playing on his lips.\n\"That’s a relief!\" Arix said, completely at ease now. Hugging Drexel’s arm, she cheerfully said, \"Come on, you worked hard today. Let me treat you to a late-night snack.\"\n\"Wow, you treating me snacks? That’s rare. Let’s go, I’m starving,\" Drexel replied happily, letting Arix cling to his arm.\nThe siblings, now in high spirits, walked to the dining hall, laughing and chatting along the way.\nHaranu, the star where the middle-aged man lived, became the focus for the interstellar police handling the case.\nAfter everything was settled, the police wanted to identify the victims in the videos to offer some compensation. However, as soon as they opened the files, all the videos vanished as if haunted.\nAt first, the police thought it was just a malfunction with their office opticomputer. They figured the archives should still have copies, so they asked a colleague in the archives to send the files over.\nBut as soon as the files were transferred, the opticomputer got hit by an incurable virus and completely crashed.\nBefore the officer could lament the loss of his brand-new opticomputer, his colleague from the archives rushed over in a panic. \"Kaith, do you still have those videos? The ones in the archives just disappeared all of a sudden.\"\nKaith said nothing, simply handing over his broken opticomputer. The realization dawned on both of them as they exchanged glances.\nFinally, the colleague sighed, \"Looks like some top-notch hacker doesn’t want those videos to remain in this world.\"\nKaith rubbed his temples and said helplessly, \"Well, it’s not necessarily a bad thing.\"\nMaybe those victims didn’t need any compensation. Perhaps it was better for them not to know the truth and endure the pain it would bring.\nSometimes, the truth can be more devastating than a lie, cutting deeper than any knife.",

      "content": "Chapter 156: No Loose Ends\nIn the restaurant on the spaceship...\nWhen the siblings stepped in, the buzz of lively chatter and the clinking of glasses came to an abrupt halt. All eyes were glued to Drexel. But this time, they weren’t just looking at him. They were watching him, like they’d spotted a real troublemaker.\nSeeing the curious and anxious faces around, Drexel felt a rush of excitement. The wealthy businessmen and ladies present suddenly felt a wave of tension, ready to flee at a moment’s notice.\nArix, equally on edge, quickly grabbed Drexel’s arm. \"Drexel, let’s be decent. Even if they were wrong before, they deserve a chance to be forgiven.\"\nSeeing the concern in his sister’s eyes, Drexel sighed and decided to hold back. The room exhaled a collective sigh of relief as the tension eased, and conversations resumed.\nThe spaceship’s restaurant was set up buffet-style. After finding a seat, Drexel and Arix went their separate ways to gather their favorite foods. Drexel headed straight for the roast beef with red wine sauce, while Arix joined the group of ladies, picking a few desserts and fruits.\n\"Hey, did you hear? Tonight at 11 PM, the Empire is going to announce a new law banning the sale and hunting of Celesterrors,\" one well-connected lady said, flaunting her insider knowledge.\n\"Really? Is the Empire trying to follow the Alliance’s example? Why suddenly introduce a Celesterror protection act?\" another lady asked eagerly.\n\"I heard it’s because someone saved Prince Cassian, and Alpha Leonidas granted that person a wish. Instead of choosing to become a Duke, that person wished to protect the Celesterrors,\" the first lady explained, with a hint of regret in her voice.\n\"Yeah, what a waste! If only that opportunity had been given to me,\" the second lady sighed.\nHearing the conversation, Arix was first taken aback. Then she remembered Mama Tiger, and a warm smile spread across her face.\n\"It’s not a waste at all,\" Arix thought silently. She picked up her tray and headed back.\n\"Why are you eating so little? You’re already so thin, and you’re still picky,\" Drexel grumbled when he saw the small selection of desserts and fruits on Arix’s tray. He then forked a piece of steak from his own heaping plate and placed it on hers.\n\"Just woke up, no appetite. If I can’t finish it, you’re on clean-up duty,\" Arix grumbled, eyeing the steak that was nearly the size of her face. She felt stuffed just looking at it.\n\"Fine, I’ll handle the leftovers,\" Drexel said, rolling his eyes. He started eating at lightning speed, as if delaying was an offense to the food.\nArix sighed and picked up her knife and fork, ready to tackle the enormous steak. But just as her knife touched it, the spaceship began shaking violently.\nThe restaurant erupted with the sounds of plates and glasses shattering.\nWealthy businessmen and ladies screamed in terror, their faces turning pale. The elegance and composure they had moments before vanished. They scurried around like frightened mice or huddled together, trembling.\nThe businessmen fared slightly better than the pampered ladies. Though clearly scared, they managed to contact the captain to find out what was happening.\nThe captain tried to calm the passengers while muttering curses under his breath.\nThey were near the Alliance border, and now a Supergiant-Class insectoid had appeared. The ship’s top security, the Maple Mercenary, consisted only of Planet-Class mecha pilots. They were utterly incapable of protecting the ship or even saving themselves.\nAs the captain grew more frantic, a crew member, panic-stricken, ran up to him. \"Captain, bad news. The Maple Guard stole all the escape pods and left.\"\n\"What did you say? Not a single escape pod left?!\" The captain looked at the crew member in disbelief.\nThe crew member nodded, despair written all over his face.\nAfter confirming the news, the captain shoved the crew member aside and sprinted to the escape pod bay himself. Finding it empty, he angrily punched the wall and gritted his teeth. \"The Maple! If I survive this, I’ll destroy your reputation!\"\n\"Captain, the Maple only has eight people. Why did they take all the escape pods?\" a terrified and confused crew member asked.\n\"Why else? They don’t want us surviving and seeking revenge, tarnishing their reputation in the mercenary world. So, they cut off our only hope of survival,\" the captain replied, struggling to keep his anger in check.\nSuddenly, an idea struck him, and he opened his opticomputer.\nAs he suspected, the Maple had installed a signal jammer on the ship. Now, calling for help from the Alliance or even contacting the Fifth Legion was impossible.\nDespair washed over the captain as he closed his eyes, feeling the weight of the hopeless situation.\n\"Captain, what do we do now?\" the young crew member asked, tears streaming down his face.\nThe captain opened his eyes and looked at the young crew member. He wanted to say there was no hope, but seeing the crew member’s youthful face, he couldn’t bring himself to do it.\nFinally, the captain sighed, \"Go tell the other crew members to find the signal jammer.\"\n\"Okay!\" The crew member nodded and ran off without hesitation.\nAfter the crew member left, the captain opened his opticomputer again, preparing to inform the passengers of the situation.\nHe hoped that someone among them could delay the insectoid long enough for the Fifth Legion to arrive.\nIn the spaceship’s restaurant...\nUnlike the panicking businessmen and ladies, Arix and Drexel’s first move was to protect the food on their plates. Once they confirmed the food was safe, they both sighed in relief.\n\"Arix, from my experience, we should eat quickly. We probably won’t get another chance,\" Drexel said, shoveling steak into his mouth while reminding Arix.\nArix nodded, and they both dug in, eating their steak directly and quickly.\nJust as they finished, the ship’s captain appeared on all the screens throughout the spaceship.\nThe captain looked serious, with barely hidden panic in his eyes. Arix and Drexel exchanged glances, both realizing things were bad.\nThe captain bowed apologetically. Then, with a look full of guilt, he said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, due to an attack by a Supergiant-Class insectoid, this ship can no longer move forward, or return.\"\n\"Right now, the ship has a temporary energy shield holding off the insectoid’s attacks, but it will only last another 10 minutes. We have requested help from the Fifth Legion, but it will take them an hour to get here. We have to hold out on our own for that hour. I ask any capable passengers or mecha pilots to come to the front of the ship to help delay the insectoid. Thank you.\"\nThe restaurant erupted in angry shouting.\n\"You know it’s a Supergiant-Class insectoid! Going there is just suicide! Do you think we’re idiots?\"\n\"Yeah, we paid for this! Why should we go? What about the security? Aren’t they mercenaries?\"\n\"Why don’t we use the escape pods? Yes! Let’s escape in the pods!\"\nAs the passengers were about to take action, the captain spoke again.\n\"I’m very sorry. Due to the selfish actions of the Maple, they have taken all the escape pods and fled. I apologize deeply for this. Once again, I ask any capable passengers or mecha pilots to come to the front of the ship to help delay the insectoid. Thank you,\" the captain explained, trying to calm the passengers.\nWith the harsh truth revealed, the passengers couldn’t muster the courage to face reality, let alone fight back.\nIn the midst of this despair, Arix and Drexel moved. They headed firmly towards the front of the ship.\n\"Where are you going?\" the people around them, though guessing their intent, asked in disbelief.\nDrexel turned to look at the dining hall. This time, he didn’t have his usual playful smile. Instead, he saluted them solemnly.\n\"I am a reservist of the Fifth Legion and a military student at the Hecaris Military Academy. I apologize for the earlier joke. You are civilians, and it is my duty to protect civilians. Goodbye, everyone,\" Drexel said with a smile.\nAfter saluting with Arix, they quickly ran towards the front of the ship.\nThe people watched in stunned silence as the siblings left. The restaurant fell quiet again, broken only by a few stifled sobs.\n\"They are still just children,\" one lady choked out.\nMost of the wealthy people fell into deeper silence, some bowing their heads in shame. A few, after a long pause, stood up and headed towards the front, including the fawning lady.\nBefore leaving, she turned to the others and said, \"If the kids aren’t afraid, why should we be? Those who aren’t cowards, follow me!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 157: Fighting The Insectoid\nWhen Arix and Drexel arrived, quite a few people were already there. Besides the captain and crew, there were about ten others with cold expressions, clearly seasoned fighters.\nTo the siblings’ surprise, three of these people had a military bearing, indicating they were from a military background. Arix and Drexel exchanged a look; they hadn’t seen these people on the ship before.\n\"They were probably in their cabins all this time,\" Drexel whispered to Arix.\nArix nodded in agreement.\nThe captain, initially pleased to see more people, sighed in disappointment when he realized they were just children.\n\"Kids, go back. This mission doesn’t include children,\" the captain said irritably. His tone wasn’t friendly, but his concern for the siblings was evident. He didn’t want to see them sacrifice themselves needlessly.\nThe others didn’t object either, especially the three military-looking individuals who nodded in agreement.\nFacing the skepticism and concern of the group, Drexel stepped forward and solemnly saluted. \"Thank you all, but my sister and I are both reservists of the Fifth Legion and military students at the Hecaris Military Academy. When civilians are in danger, our duty doesn’t allow us to flee.\"\nDrexel’s expression was serious, his eyes showing firm resolve.\nArix also nodded firmly, showing that she shared her brother’s intent.\nSeeing the young siblings, the captain’s lips trembled with complex emotions, and tears began to stream down his cheeks.\nHe turned away and wiped his eyes, feeling a bit ashamed. Then he turned back, looking at the siblings with a serious expression, and said, \"Alright! Thank you both!\"\nDrexel and Arix hung back for a moment, exchanging looks as the three military guys smiled and waved them over. Nodding in sync, the siblings walked up to them.\nThe leader, a middle-aged man, stepped forward with a warm smile, extending his hand. \"Hi there, I’m Captain Sentance of the Alliance’s First Legion. These are my buddies, Lieutenant Commanders Gillian and Clayton. Nice to meet you.\"\nDrexel shook his hand politely. \"Hello, sir, I’m Drexel, a student at Hecaris Military Academy, and this is my sister, Arix. It’s a pleasure to meet you.\"\nAt the mention of Drexel’s name, the officers just paused. But when Arix’s name came up, they looked like they’d just seen a god. Their eyes widened with shock and fear, not because of Arix herself, but because she was here. The future of the Alliance was standing right in front of them, in danger. It was more terrifying than facing a Supergiant-Class insectoid.\nSeeing their panicked expressions, Arix tilted her head, curiosity piqued. \"Are you guys okay?\"\nDespite their internal turmoil, the officers managed to keep calm smiles. \"We’re fine, just surprised to see you on this ship. Didn’t the Fifth Legion arrange a battleship to escort you?\"\nArix scratched the back of her head, a bit embarrassed. \"Oh, a battleship isn’t necessary. I’m just a military student. That would be overkill.\"\nSentance immediately shook his head. \"Miss Kering, you invented the psychic power healing potion. It’s saved countless lives. Many of our retired comrades are back in service because of it. They owe you a lot.\"\n\"Really? I’m glad I could help,\" Arix said, her face lighting up with genuine happiness.\nThe officers, moved by her kindness, felt even more upset. They silently vowed to complain to their superiors.\nThe Fifth Legion was negligent for not providing a bodyguard and letting Arix travel alone on this shabby ship. The thought of it made their hearts ache.\n’Oh, our poor Miss Kering!’\nthey lamented inwardly.\nDrexel, who was actually sent by the Fifth Legion to look after Arix, felt a bit left out. \"What about me? Am I invisible here?\"\nCaptain Sentance turned to Arix with a serious expression. \"Miss Kering, you are a hero to our First Legion. If you ever face danger, hide behind us. We will protect you with our lives,\" he said, saluting her with determination.\n\"No, I can take care of myself,\" Arix quickly responded, shaking her head. Though she wasn’t a mecha expert yet, she wasn’t helpless.\nSentance frowned, clearly troubled. Drexel, noticing he was being ignored again, forced a polite smile. \"Captain, don’t worry. I can protect my sister.\"\nSentance, snapping back to reality, remembered that Drexel, brother of the Fifth Legion’s admiral, was also present. His expression turned even more serious.\nArix represented the future hope of the Alliance, and Drexel was the future of the Fifth Legion. They couldn’t risk losing either of them. The loss of either would be catastrophic.\nTurning to his comrades, Sentance said, \"You two will be responsible for protecting Mr. and Miss Kering. They must not come to any harm!\"\nGillian and Clayton nodded solemnly. \"Yes, sir!\"\nDrexel, still confused about being included, shrugged. \"Why am I getting dragged into this too?\" But he decided it was okay. With Arix protected, he could relax a bit.\nHe turned to Arix. \"Arix, you haven’t piloted a real mecha yet. During the fight, stay back.\"\n\"Okay, I understand,\" Arix replied, feeling a bit down despite knowing Drexel was right.\nJust then, a warm hand landed on Arix’s head. She looked up to see Drexel gently patting her hair, his eyes soft. \"Don’t be discouraged. I believe you’ll be a better mecha pilot than me someday.\"\n\"Drexel...\" Arix began, touched, but Drexel suddenly burst into a triumphant laugh. \"But that’s a long way off. Accept it, Arix. You’re just weaker than me, hahaha!\"\nArix’s touched expression vanished. She grabbed the hand on her head and, with a swift motion, threw Drexel over her shoulder.\n\"Ow, ow, ow! It hurts!\" Drexel rubbed his butt, looking betrayed. \"Arix, you tigress! You’re trying to kill me or what?\"\nArix squinted her eyes, her smile growing even sweeter. \"What did you just say? Did I hear ’tigress’?\"\nSeeing his sister’s smile, which reminded him of a dangerous Chomper, Drexel felt a chill down his spine. He nervously shook his head. \"No, no, no. You heard wrong. You’re so gentle and cute, how could you be a tigress?\"\nArix gave a cold laugh and was ready to give Drexel another \"loving lesson\" when the captain’s voice rang out, calling for assembly.\n\"Heroes, please come over and prepare for departure!\"\nHearing this, Arix snorted and decided to leave Drexel alone for now. The three officers, who had watched the entire scene, exchanged amused glances before turning their heads away, smiling to themselves.",

      "content": "Chapter 158: Doubts\nDrexel saw this and sighed with relief. He quickly slipped to Captain Sentence’s side, as if he had seen a savior.\nHe was so eager that it seemed like he couldn’t wait to fight the insectoids.\nCaptain Sentence thought the same and looked at Drexel with some emotion, saying, \"Young man, you’re still young. Don’t push yourself so hard. We adults are here to help.\"\nSeeing Captain Sentence misunderstanding, Drexel silently screamed in his mind,\n’Compared to Arix, Supergiant-Class insectoids are nothing!’\nBut he didn’t dare say this out loud. If Arix heard, he wouldn’t make it back to the Alliance standing up.\nDrexel forced a very reluctant smile and nodded to Sentence, pretending to agree.\nSentence, thinking Drexel had listened to his advice, smiled back with satisfaction.\nHe felt even more that Drexel was truly a kind, brave, and humble young man.\nWhen everyone was ready for the battle, Captain Sentence invited everyone over.\nEverybody hoped Sentence would lead the battle, but Sentence shook his head and said, \"I only took the lead before because there was no suitable person. Now that the right person is here, I don’t need to show off.\"\nAs Sentence finished speaking, everyone looked over curiously.\nThey were all wondering who Sentence was talking about.\n\"Mr. Kering, come over here,\" Sentence said, looking at Drexel, who was standing by and watching the show.\nDrexel’s jaw dropped.\nUnder the skeptical and disapproving gazes of the crowd, Drexel calmly stood next to Sentence.\nActually, it wasn’t just the crowd; even Arix was a bit surprised.\nShe looked at Gillian beside her and asked worriedly, \"Are you sure you want him to do that? After all, he’s still a student.\"\nGillian smiled and said, \"Miss Arix, you probably don’t know much about the heirs of the five major families, do you?\"\nArix nodded. She didn’t know much because Drexel usually seemed carefree, making it easy to overlook his abilities.\nBut thinking about the battle with the insectoid crown prince, Arix hesitated.\nEven she couldn’t beat Quispe, but Drexel could suppress him. Clearly, he wasn’t weak.\nGillian had heard that Miss Kering from the Kering family had been lost on Planet Waste for nearly ten years and was only recently found.\nIf she had lived in such an isolated place, it was normal not to know these things.\nSeeing Arix still deep in thought, a hint of pity flashed in Gillian’s eyes. He gently explained, \"The heirs of the five families are not only skilled in military tactics but also possess great combat abilities. So, Miss Kering, you don’t need to worry. Plus, we’re here. We won’t let anything happen to your brother.\"\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Arix gratefully replied. Then, she turned her gaze to Drexel, standing at the front of the crowd.\nAt that moment, Drexel was facing everyone’s doubts. It wasn’t that they had anything against him personally; they just didn’t want to trust their lives to a child.\n\"Captain Sentence, it’s not that we doubt you, but this is too much. He’s barely even an adult. How can we trust a kid to lead us?\" said a space mercenary with a large machete, full of skepticism.\n\"Yeah, this is a battle, not child’s play. We can’t risk our lives on this kind of joke. If this is the case, I’m not going,\" a businessman added, who was already regretting his impulsive decision to join.\n\"Captain Sentence, you should lead. We trust the Alliance military more,\" the leader of the mercenaries said coldly.\n\"Yes, Captain Sentence, you should take charge,\" Captain Sentence started to persuade.\nHe even thought to himself that Sentence was being childish.\nFacing the crowd’s doubts, Sentence didn’t respond immediately. Instead, he looked at Drexel and asked, \"Mr. Kering, what do you think?\"\n\"Sir, you can call me Drexel,\" Drexel smiled at Sentence. Then he turned to the crowd and said, \"My name is Drexel Kering, the heir of the Kering family of the Alliance. Are you still worried?\"\nDrexel’s voice wasn’t loud, but it struck the crowd like thunder.\nThey might not know Drexel’s name, but the title of an heir of one of the Alliance’s five major families was enough to shock them.\nAn heir of the five major families also meant the future admiral of one of the Alliance’s five great legions.\nIf he wasn’t qualified to lead, then no one in the world would be.\nThe crowd swallowed hard, and their attitudes changed instantly.\n\"So you are the young master of the Kering family. My apologies for the misunderstanding. Why didn’t you say so earlier? We were worried for nothing,\" the mercenary with the large machete said, smiling awkwardly.\n\"Yes, it’s an honor to follow your command. I hope you can give me an autograph afterward. I’ll cherish it as a family heirloom,\" the businessman said, transforming from a critic to an eager follower.\n\"It’s an honor to fight by your side,\" the mercenary leader said to Drexel, nodding in approval.\n\"With Mr. Kering here, not even ten Supergiant-Class insectoids would be a problem...\" One man began to flatter Drexel, but his friend quickly covered his mouth and dragged him away.\nWith everyone on the same page, Drexel used his opticomputer to create a temporary channel, adding everyone’s numbers.\nDrexel gave his first order: everyone needed to get into their mechas and prep for battle.\nHearing his youthful yet energetic voice in their headsets, the group no longer feared facing a Supergiant-Class insectoid. Instead, they were filled with determination.\nAfter all, this young man was the future admiral of the Alliance. Fighting alongside him today would be a great story to share with friends later!\nWhen everyone took out their mechas, Drexel and Arix unveiled their impressive Supergiant-Class mechas, gifted by Luna Amethyst.\nAs Drexel and Arix displayed their mechas, a wave of envy swept through the crowd.\nDrexel’s mecha, an ice-blue giant with a long spear, immediately locked onto him. It knelt, extended a hand, and in a cool yet respectful mechanical voice, said, \"Master, my name is Blue Raven. I am pleased to fight with you.\"\nDrexel, grinning, kissed its fingers and replied, \"Hello, Blue Raven. I’m Drexel. The honor is mine.\"\nMeanwhile, Arix eagerly held her mecha’s Space Button.\nShe summoned a fiery red mecha, brandishing a sword. It also knelt before her, despite its fierce appearance, and said in a cold voice, \"Master, my name is Star Dust. I am pleased to fight with you.\"\n\"Thank you, Star Dust. I’m Arix. It’s an honor to fight with you.\" She shook the finger of the mecha, which was as thick as her waist.\nWith introductions done, Arix and Drexel exchanged a look and a nod before entering their mecha cabins.\nInside her cabin, Arix saw Star Dust’s AI on a screen. The AI appeared as a young woman, around 15, dressed in a red combat suit and wielding a large machete, exuding a silent but lethal vibe.\nAfter greeting each other again, Arix linked her psychic power with Star Dust’s AI. Star Dust’s voice then resonated in the cabin.\n\"Psychic system, connected!\"\n\"Energy system, sufficient!\"\n\"Power system, normal!\"\n\"Mecha self-check complete. Everything is normal. Please prepare for battle, Master.\"\n\"Star Dust, start the energy system and get ready for battle,\" Arix instructed, verifying the mecha with her psychic power.\n\"Yes, Master,\" Star Dust replied.\nThe energy system roared to life, converting energy stones into power.\nArix was all set. Once everyone was ready, Drexel’s voice came through the wireless headset.\n\"Captain, open the front hatch of the spaceship. Over.\"\n\"Received, opening the hatch. Over.\"\n\"Roger, over.\"\nAs the spaceship’s hatch slowly opened, the Supergiant-Class insectoids outside grew more agitated, claws ready, attacking the ship’s energy shield.",

      "content": "Chapter 159: Death Sting\nFacing the massive scorpion-like insectoid in front of him, Drexel held back from charging in recklessly. Instead, he activated his mecha’s radar to scan the creature. Once the scan finished, essential details popped up on the screen.\nType:\nMutant\nAlliance Name:\nDeath Sting\nClass:\nSupergiant-Class\nLength:\n1598 meters\nWidth:\n358 meters\nNotes:\nDeath Sting is violent and easily angered, attacking all nearby creatures, including its own allies.\nWith this information, Drexel issued his orders.\n\"Heavy armor mecha pilots, cover the snipers. Snipers, use your rifles to target its head from a distance. Combat mechas, get in close to deal extra damage and keep it distracted. Over.\"\n\"Heavy armor, understood. Over.\"\n\"Sniper, understood. Over.\"\n\"Combat, understood. Over.\"\nOnce everyone acknowledged, Drexel’s focus intensified. \"Move out! Attack!\"\nLeading the charge, Drexel controlled his mecha to leap forward, delivering a powerful blow to the insectoid’s head with his spear.\nThis sneak attack enraged Death Sting, a creature already on edge.\nDeath Sting screeched, abandoning its assault on the spaceship to pursue Drexel.\nDrexel quickly maneuvered his mecha, darting away with agility. He kept just out of reach, circling the giant insectoid and occasionally striking with his spear.\nThe combat mechas joined Drexel, hitting Death Sting whenever it got too close to him, drawing its attention away. The insectoid’s shell was incredibly tough; only Drexel’s mecha could inflict serious damage, while the others left minor marks.\nLuckily, Death Sting’s aggressive nature worked in their favor. It focused on whatever attacked it, making their tactics effective—something that wouldn’t work with other insectoids.\nWhile Drexel and the combat mechas risked everything to distract Death Sting, the sniper mechas took shots at its head from a distance with their ion guns. =\nHowever, their firepower was insufficient. Though they managed to cause some damage, it only made Death Sting angrier, increasing the danger for the combat mecha pilots.\nRealizing the strategy was faltering, Drexel quickly issued another command. \"Arix, their firepower isn’t enough. You need to take over the long-range sniping on its head! Over.\"\n\"Understood. Over.\" Arix acknowledged, though her confidence in her shooting skills was low. Still, her Supergiant-Class mecha was their best chance for a decisive shot. She couldn’t afford to fail.\nStar Dust’s sword morphed into a sniper energy gun. Arix gripped the joystick, focusing the scope on Death Sting’s head. But the creature’s relentless thrashing made it difficult for her to get a clear shot.\nWatching Drexel take another blow, Arix’s frustration boiled over. Her eyes reddened, and she bit her lip until it nearly bled. She had to steady her aim.\nJust when Arix felt completely hopeless, something stirred deep within her soul. It felt like a pair of glowing eyes slowly opened, ancient and wise, peering through the darkness.\nThese eyes seemed to understand Arix’s dilemma and flickered slightly. In an instant, Arix knew what Death Sting’s next move would be.\nWith a calm composure, she pulled the trigger and fired her beam cannon at a spot just a meter in front of Death Sting’s head.\nAt first, everyone thought Arix had missed her shot, even Drexel. He was ready to console his sister when Death Sting moved forward to attack.\nRight then, Arix’s beam cannon struck its head dead-on, killing it instantly.\nDeath Sting fell, drifting into the vastness of space.\nAll the mecha pilots were left speechless.\nAfter a long silence, Drexel suddenly yelled, snapping everyone out of their shock.\n\"Oh damn! That Insectoid Core is worth a billion astrocredits! Save it!\"\nThe pilots snapped out of their daze and rushed toward the insectoid’s body. Arix, still in her mecha, was bewildered. She realized this wasn’t a fluke—she had just predicted the future!\nThis ability felt oddly familiar, and she thought of Sylvana.\n’Do I possess Sylvana’s power now? Can I see the past and predict the future? Can I win the lottery?’\nExcited, Arix opened her opticomputer and tried her luck on a lottery website. She promptly lost 1000 astrocredits.\nWith a sigh, Arix covered her forehead with her hand. She felt foolish. Maybe it was just luck. Everyone has strong intuition sometimes.\nSnapping out of her daydream, Arix saw Drexel running after the Insectoid Core.\n’Hasn’t he learned his lesson yet? Why is he chasing after it again?’\nWhen everyone finally returned to the ship with the Insectoid Core, Drexel got an earful from Arix.\n\"Arix, cut me some slack, will you? Everyone’s watching,\" Drexel said, wincing in pain, no longer the confident leader he usually was.\nThe crew watching them smiled at the sibling’s antics. They pretended not to notice, averting their gazes.\nThey tried to act like they weren’t listening, but their ears were clearly tuned in.\n\"Miss Kering, carry on. We didn’t see anything,\" the captain joked, smiling now that the crisis had passed.\nWhen the captain made his joke, Drexel wasn’t amused. He shot the captain a betrayed look and complained, \"Captain, you’re abandoning me pretty quickly, aren’t you?\"\n\"Haha!\" The crew burst into even louder laughter.\nArix laughed too, shaking her head. She let go of Drexel’s ear, no longer angry.\nThe moment was filled with laughter and jokes, easing the tension.\nThe Fifth Legion, which was scheduled to arrive in an hour, showed up ten minutes early.\nAs their battleship approached, the captain opened the front hatch to welcome the Alliance soldiers. Soon, two rows of well-trained soldiers stood in the front chamber.\nArix’s excitement soared when she saw the officer leading the Fifth Legion. She wanted to run up and hug him but felt too shy since he was busy talking to the captain. She pouted and waited patiently.\nWhen Thaddeus finished his work, he immediately scanned the crowd for Arix. Despite the changes she had gone through, he spotted his beloved daughter right away.\n\"Arix, come here,\" Thaddeus called out with a big smile, opening his arms.\n\"Dad!\" Arix beamed and ran into Thaddeus’s arms.\nThaddeus’s serious expression softened as he hugged his daughter. \"Arix, did you miss me this past month?\" he asked gently.\n\"Yes, I did! I lost several pounds because I couldn’t see you,\" Arix said, pouting while hugging his arm.\nSeeing her round face, Thaddeus laughed and pinched her cheek, not pointing out her little lie.\n\"Dad! I missed you too!\" Drexel, who had been hiding from his sister, now ran excitedly towards Thaddeus.\nBut before he could get close, Thaddeus stopped him with a hand and frowned, \"Aren’t you a bit too old for this?\"\nDrexel was stunned, looking at Arix, who was only a year younger. He didn’t dare to say anything and just stood to the side, feeling left out.\nOnce everything was settled on the spaceship, Thaddeus took his daughter back to the battleship. After a few steps, he remembered his son and turned to look at Drexel, who was sulking in a corner.\nThaddeus sighed, shaking his head, and called out, \"Drexel, let’s go home.\"\n\"Hey! I’m coming!\" Drexel shouted excitedly, no longer sulking in the corner. He jumped up, eager to leave the ship with his dad and sister.\nBut just before he left, Drexel stopped. He turned back and tossed the Insectoid Core to Sentance. His face was a mix of emotions as he said, \"Split this Supergiant-Class Insectoid Core among everyone who helped today.\"\nDrexel quickly turned and walked away, almost as if he feared Sentance might refuse.\nSentance stood there, holding the Insectoid Core in shock. After a moment, he smiled and shook his head, saying, \"They’re both such good kids.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 160: Wrong Gift\nOut of the captain’s sight, Drexel felt a sharp pang in his chest. He was heartbroken.\nHe had just given away 100 million astrocredits.\nArix noticed what happened and gave her brother an approving thumbs up. \"You did the right thing,\" she said. \"I saw their mechas were badly damaged. With that Insectoid Core, they should have enough money to fix them.\"\nDrexel nodded. That was exactly why he gave away the Insectoid Core.\nIt made sense, but his heart still ached.\nThaddeus listened quietly to his kids’ conversation. Once he understood the situation, he reached out and ruffled both their heads, smiling proudly. \"You did the right thing. I am so proud of you.\"\nBoth Drexel and Arix felt a bit embarrassed by the praise.\nDrexel, in particular, felt shy. He looked proud, though, and a big smile spread across his face.\nNo matter how strong someone is, they’re still just kids who need love from their parents.\nOn Planet Hecaris...\nThe ship carrying Arix and her family stopped at the gates of the Kerings’.\nThaddeus spoke to the officers seeing them off, then got off with his children.\nAs soon as he got off the ship, Thaddeus spotted Fleur running toward him excitedly.\nHe had been busy lately, and his wife must have missed him a lot.\nLooking at his beautiful wife, Thaddeus’s eyes were brimming with love, and a big smile appeared on his face. He opened his arms, ready for a hug.\nBut then, his dear wife ran right past him.\nThaddeus was confused.\nHe turned stiffly and saw his wife happily hugging Arix, looking very content.\nThaddeus glanced at his empty arms, then at Drexel, and quietly lowered his arms.\nFleur didn’t notice Thaddeus’s actions. She was too happy hugging her daughter and kissing her cheeks.\n\"You little rascal, you didn’t come to see me for a whole month. Did you forget about your mother?\" Fleur playfully tapped Arix’s forehead with a smile.\n\"Hehe, no way, Mom. I missed you too. Look, I brought you a gift from the Empire.\" Arix said, taking out an ice-blue bead from her Space Button and handing it to Fleur like a treasure.\nThough she bought this bead from a street vendor, she had soaked it in a special solution for a long time. Now it not only had a calming effect but also smelled nice.\nLooking at the beaded pendant on a string, Fleur happily took it and examined it for a while. Then she kissed Arix and said, \"Thank you, Arix. I love it.\"\n\"I’m glad you like it, Mom,\" Arix said, shyly touching her face with her hands.\n\"Arix, where’s my gift?\" Thaddeus coughed and asked nonchalantly.\nFleur chuckled as she saw how much Thaddeus wanted a gift but tried to act indifferent.\n\"Oh, right, I have something for Dad too.\" Arix rummaged through her space pocket and took out another beaded pendant.\n\"This is for you, Dad,\" Arix said sweetly, handing the pendant to Thaddeus.\n\"Thank you, Arix. I love it,\" Thaddeus said, patting Arix’s head fondly.\nDrexel watched his parents shower Arix with more affection after receiving her gifts. A thought struck him, and he also took out something from his Space Button, handing it to Thaddeus and Fleur.\n\"Mom, Dad, these are my gifts for you,\" Drexel said confidently with a smile.\nThaddeus and Fleur were surprised and looked at Drexel and then at the gifts he handed them.\nDrexel gave each of them a book. To Thaddeus, he handed \"Dream Guy DIY,\" and to Fleur, he gave \"Cougar’s Playbook.\"\nThaddeus and Fleur’s faces turned dark simultaneously. Fleur gave a cold laugh and looked at Drexel with a smirk, \"Are you sure these are the books you meant to give us?\"\nArix glanced at the awkward books and sympathetically looked at Drexel. She knew he must have grabbed the wrong ones. Seeing the frustration on their parents’ faces, she figured Drexel wouldn’t escape punishment today.\nDrexel proudly lifted his chin and nodded confidently. But when he didn’t hear any praise from his parents after a while, he realized something was wrong. He looked down at the books and almost had a heart attack.\nHe cautiously looked up and, with an innocent smile, said, \"Mom, Dad, do you believe I grabbed the wrong gifts? These are for my classmates...\"\nBefore Drexel could continue, Fleur interrupted him. \"The truth doesn’t matter anymore, son. I just want you to know that your allowance for this month is gone,\" she said with a sweet smile.\nDrexel’s eyes widened, and just as he was about to plead, Thaddeus cut him off.\n\"Son, we haven’t trained together in a while. Today, I have time to train with you more,\" Thaddeus said, grinning as he put his arm around Drexel’s neck and dragged him towards the training center.\nDrexel wanted to ask Arix for help but was too scared it would make things worse. In the end, he just moved his lips a bit and resigned himself to his fate.\n\"Mom, will Drexel be okay?\" Arix asked sympathetically, watching her brother being dragged away like a helpless puppy.\n\"He’ll be fine. Your dad and he are just having some fun,\" Fleur reassured her, patting Arix’s head. Then she remembered something and said, \"Oh, by the way, Cirilla and the others are in the garden. Do you want to go and join your friends?\"\n\"Cirilla is here?!\" Arix’s eyes lit up with excitement.\nFleur nodded gently.\n\"Great! Mom, I’m going to see them now. Bye-bye!\" Arix said, waving goodbye to her mother and running excitedly towards the garden.\nAs for Drexel, she had already forgotten about him.\nIn the garden, Arix showed up and spotted Cirilla and her friends chatting in a cozy gazebo.\nShe wanted to greet them but hesitated, pulling out a small mirror to check her face. Seeing her new look, Arix grinned mischievously and got an idea.\nShe grabbed a plate of fruit from her Space Button.\nAfter another quick glance at her reflection, Arix made her way softly towards Cirilla and the gang.\nCirilla and the others were \"admiring\" Elio at the moment.\n\"Elio, did you secretly get some cosmetic work done? You look completely different,\" Cirilla said lazily. She held a Celesterror Lord egg, glancing at the young man beside her.\nElio, with his delicate features and smooth skin, looked like a work of art among the flowers. He glared at Cirilla and then, feeling a bit self-conscious, pulled out a small mirror to examine his thin face.\nElio said, pinching his still chubby cheeks with some concern, \"Now I think I look better when I’m chubby. Now I’m just to thin. If I get any thinner, I’ll be like Arix. Gosh, she’s almost all bones, remember?\"\nArix, arriving with the fruit, almost tripped when she heard this.\n’All bone? Really?’\nshe thought but held back her retort as they noticed her. She put on a sweet expression and greeted them softly, \"Hello, my name is Ari...a, yes, Aria. I brought some fruit for you.\"\nCirilla, Zephyr, and Varden were a bit taken aback by her nice appearance, but they stayed polite, only nodding quietly in acknowledgment.\nCirilla, uninterested in delicate girls, kept focusing on her Celesterror Lord egg She adjusted the incubator temperature to 36 degrees as suggested online.\nZephyr was more interested in his new energy gun, which he hadn’t tried out yet. His cold eyes gleamed with anticipation.\nVarden eyed Arix skeptically, wondering if she was related to the Kering family.\nAmong them, only Elio was struck by her beauty. He stared at her for a moment before blurting out, \"She’s a vision! Gosh!\"\nRealizing what he said, Elio’s face turned red. He scratched his head shyly and greeted Arix, \"Hello, I’m Elio.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 161: Lady Aria\nArix noticed no one recognized her and chuckled quietly. Putting on a dignified yet delicate expression, she looked at Elio and said, \"You must be Elio? I’ve heard a lot about you. Weren’t you supposed to be a bit chubby?\"\nElio’s heart skipped a beat.\n’She knows me! She’s so gentle and cute! Oh my God, I think I’m in love!’\nFeeling both nervous and shy, Elio quickly denied, \"Don’t listen to them, Aria. Do I look fat to you? I’ve always been this slim.\"\n\"Really? Then I’ll buy that for now, Elio,\" Arix said, covering her mouth as she smiled, like a real lady.\nSeeing her smile, Elio cracked a foolish grin as well. Cirilla and the others looked at Elio, speechless.\n’Wasn’t he just complaining about being too skinny? Now he’s worried about being called fat?’\nVarden eyed Elio with disdain, then turned his gaze to \"Aria,\" the new girl. Something about how she called \"Elio\" felt familiar, like his mischievous cousin Arix.\nThe more Varden thought about it, the more suspicious he became, his gaze deepening.\nArix, chatting with Elio, felt uncomfortable under Varden’s intense stare. She glanced at him and, seeing him playing with his opticomputer, breathed a sigh of relief.\n’It must have been my imagination.’\nVarden, meanwhile, was reading a chat with Fleur on his screen. After seeing a recent message from Fleur, he smirked, understanding the situation.\n’Oh, so that’s how it is. Let’s see how long you can keep this up, Arix.’\nVarden laughed to himself, his face becoming even more gentle and kind. \"You’re Aria, right? Funny, I never heard Aunt mention you,\" he said, interrupting Elio’s conversation with Arix.\nEveryone was stunned, especially Elio. He was annoyed but too afraid to confront Varden, the usually cunning one.\nArix’s eyes twitched, her whole body tensing up. She swallowed hard and said softly, \"You must be Varden. It’s no surprise you haven’t heard of me. I’ve always been in the Empire and rarely come to the Alliance.\"\nVarden raised an eyebrow, smirking. \"Oh, is that so? No wonder. I was thinking how much gentler you are than Arix.\"\nArix’s eyes darted around, feeling awkward. \"Is... is that so? But I think Arix is also very gentle.\"\nVarden laughed inwardly but kept smiling. \"Then you must not know Arix well. She’s lazy, gluttonous, always sleeps in, and gets starstruck by handsome guys.\"\n\"Is... is that so? I think you must be mistaken, Varden. Cousin Arix is not like that. She’s very gentle and cute,\" Arix said. Her forehead started to throb as she suppressed the urge to punch Varden. And she grinded her teeth as she spoke.\n\"Oh, you really don’t know her, do you? Let me tell you, she’s a real tigress! When she gets fierce, it’s terrifying. She can scare the kids next door to tears,\" Varden said with a grin, emphasizing the word \"tigress.\"\nHearing Varden badmouth Arix, Cirilla looked up, feeling annoyed.\n’Stay calm, stay calm, I can’t get angry while acting...,’\nArix tried to convince herself, but her anger hit its peak, like a volcano erupting.\n\"Varden! Who are you calling a tigress?!\" Arix glared at her cousin, feeling her small canine teeth itching.\n\"Oh, done acting now, my dear cousin Arix?\" Varden said, looking smug and teasing her.\nThis sudden twist left Cirilla, who was about to defend Arix, stunned.\n\"Arix? \"\n\"What are you talking about?\"\nCirilla and Elio both looked at Arix in shock.\nEven Zephyr glanced up at Arix before returning to his beloved energy gun.\nElio’s heart shattered as he realized the truth.\n’Where did my gentle goddess go? How did she turn into the fierce Arix?’\nhe thought, feeling devastated. In these short ten minutes, poor Elio experienced the full cycle of love and heartbreak.\nRealizing she had exposed herself, Arix’s anger vanished instantly, like a bucket of ice had doused her flames.\nShe carefully observed the others’ expressions: Varden looked smug, Elio seemed disillusioned, and Zephyr remained indifferent. Only Cirilla had narrowed eyes, as if ready to punch someone.\nArix shivered in fear. Quickly, she tried to laugh it off, \"Ahahaha, it’s been so long since I’ve seen you all. I thought I’d give you a surprise. So, did it work? Were you surprised?\"\n\"Arix, keep surprises like this to yourself next time,\" Elio said, almost in tears. He thought he had met a gentle goddess, only to find it was Arix in disguise.\n\"Got it,\" Arix said awkwardly, coughing to cover her embarrassment. She quickly changed the subject, \"So, why are you all here together today? Is something going on?\"\n\"There are two reasons. One is that we wanted to see you, and the other is a bit harder to explain,\" Elio said, calming down a bit as he spoke. Luckily, he was naturally easygoing and quickly put the earlier disappointment behind him.\n\"What could it be that even you all find hard to say?\" Arix’s curiosity was piqued. These four were not only heirs to major families but also considered the best of their generation in the Alliance. If they found something tricky, it had to be serious.\n\"Well, we’ll discuss it when Drexel arrives. Speaking of which, where is your brother?\" Elio asked, puzzled.\nThinking of Drexel being forced to train, Arix rubbed her nose and said, \"It’s a bit complicated. Give me a moment, I’ll go rescue him.\"\nShe then opened her opticomputer, tapped a few buttons, and started contacting Thaddeus. The others exchanged curious glances and then looked at Arix expectantly.\nThe call connected quickly, and Drexel’s screams, like those of a pig being slaughtered, could be heard through the screen. Thaddeus’s kind voice followed, \"Arix, I’m busy torturing your borther. Have no time to talk now.\"\n\"Dad, I need to talk to him. Can you send to the garden?\" Arix asked sweetly.\n\"Sure, I’ll send him right over,\" Thaddeus agreed without hesitation.\n\"Thanks, Dad. Goodbye,\" Arix said, ending the call.\nWhen she looked up, she saw four pairs of eyes filled with curiosity. Arix blinked in confusion and asked, \"Why are you all staring at me?\"\n\"No, we weren’t looking at you. We were looking at what Drexel was doing. So, what was happening to him?\" Elio asked, his curiosity burning brightly. From Drexel’s screams, it sounded like he did something embarrassing that made their dad furious.\n\"Uh, don’t ask me. This is really hard to explain,\" Arix quickly shook her head, refusing to answer.\nSeeing that they couldn’t get any information from Arix, the group reluctantly dropped the subject.\nArix sighed in relief and then turned her attention to the Celesterror egg in Cirilla’s arms.\nThe egg was bright red with golden patterns. It was clear that this was no ordinary egg.\n\"Cirilla, is that a Celesterror egg?\" Arix asked curiously.\nCirilla nodded, gently stroking the eggshell. \"Yes, this is the egg the female Celesterror Lord entrusted to us before she died, the day we were surrounded by insectoids.\"\nAt the mention of that day, Arix’s expression soured. It was a dark moment in her life.\nThinking of a certain crazy and twisted insectoid, Arix’s face darkened further. She hoped never to encounter him again.\nArix shook her head and then asked, \"It’s been a month since that incident. Isn’t the father coming to get his egg?\"\nAs soon as Arix said this, Cirilla seemed to remember something important. She quickly placed the egg in Arix’s arms.\n\"Cirilla, what are you doing?\" Arix asked, bewildered, holding the suddenly handed-over Celesterror Lord egg.\n\"I almost forgot something crucial. Arix, can you check this egg? Its psychic power seems to be problematic, and that’s why it hasn’t hatched yet,\" Cirilla said with concern, furrowing her brows. She had been taking care of this egg for a month and had grown attached to it.\nHearing this, Arix didn’t hesitate. She immediately channeled her Vita psychic power into the egg to check its condition.\nAs soon as her psychic power entered the eggshell, Arix realized the situation was serious. The little life inside the egg was losing its psychic power and vitality. If she had been any later in discovering this, it might have become a dead egg.\nArix looked up at the group, her expression serious. \"It’s quite serious, but fortunately, we found it in time. It can be treated.\"\n\"That’s great news! How do we treat it? Should we start now?\" Cirilla asked, looking at the Celesterror Lord egg nervously.\nArix nodded, \"Yes, let’s start now. It will take about an hour.\"\n\"Do you need my help?\" Varden asked quickly.\nEarlier, Varden had also checked the egg but could only sense that the psychic power seemed to be weakening gradually. He hadn’t detected anything else unusual.\n\"No need. I can handle it by myself. I’ll start the treatment now. Just make sure no one disturbs me,\" Arix instructed them.\n\"Got it, Arix. We’ll make sure you’re not disturbed,\" they all nodded seriously.\nFeeling much more at ease, Arix nodded back and placed the Celesterror Lord egg on the table. She then closed her eyes and slowly channeled her psychic power into the egg.\nAs soon as her psychic power entered the eggshell, Arix’s consciousness followed it, finding herself beside the curled-up little hatchling inside.",

      "content": "Chapter 162: The Power of Money\nAs soon as Arix entered the eggshell, her mind linked with the psychic energy, leading her to the curled-up baby creature inside.\nIt was a Celesterror chick, almost fully developed. Normally, it should have hatched by now.\nHowever, due to an issue with its psychic power, its consciousness had fallen into a deep sleep to slow down the loss of energy and life force.\nThis was just a temporary fix. If it didn’t hatch soon, the chick would suffocate and die, becoming a dead egg.\n\"Arix, do you need my help?\" Vita asked, sensing Arix was using her psychic power.\n\"It’s alright, I got this,\" Arix replied, shaking her head. She understood the problem: the flow of psychic power was chaotic and conflicting, causing the chick to lose life force. Fixing this meant adjusting the psychic flow. The process was simple but it’s gonna take long.\n\"Okay, just tell me if you need anything,\" Vita said, feeling reassured.\n\"Thanks, Vita.\" Arix began the delicate task of adjusting the chick’s psychic power. It was like untangling a knotted ball of yarn—tedious and intricate. But seeing the neat flow of psychic power in the end gave Arix a sense of accomplishment.\nAfter thoroughly checking for issues, Arix exited the chick’s psychic world.\nLooking at the now healthy chick, Arix smiled. Thinking about the challenges it had faced even before birth, Arix wished it well, \"Little one, I hope you hatch soon and live a safe life.\"\nAfterward, Arix left, not noticing a sudden golden light that appeared before the chick, forming an ancient emblem on its forehead. Anyone from the Moon Goddess Temple would have been shocked—it was a blessing from Sylvana, the Moon Goddess.\nReturning to her body, Arix opened her eyes to several expectant faces. Handing the Celesterror egg back to Cirilla, Arix smiled, \"It’s fine now. It should hatch in a few days.\"\n\"That’s great, Arix, thank you,\" Cirilla said excitedly, clutching the egg.\n\"No problem. Did you get Drexel here?\" Arix asked, looking puzzled.\nEveryone’s expressions turned strange, and they all pointed behind Arix.\nCurious, Arix turned around to see a pig-faced guy staring into a mirror, lost in self-pity.\nArix burst into laughter at Drexel’s bruised and swollen face. It looked terrible, but it was also pretty hilarious.\nDrexel, looking annoyed, said, \"Arix, you’ll lose me if you keep laughing at me like that.\"\n\"But seriously, why haven’t you used a healing potion yet? Why are you still walking around with a pig face?\" Arix laughed so hard she could barely breathe.\n\"Dad said I could only drink the healing potion at dinner. I think he’s just jealous that I’m more handsome than he is,\" Drexel replied, touching his face sadly while holding a mirror.\n\"Stop being so vain. You gave Mom that kind of book right in front of Dad. You’re lucky you’re still breathing,\" Arix teased mercilessly.\nDrexel winced, feeling the pain all over again. He then pulled out two books from his Space Button and, nearly grinding his teeth, threw them at Elio. \"Next time, don’t ask me to bring such nonsense.\"\nEveryone glanced at the book titles and burst into laughter. Elio quickly put the books away, coughing awkwardly. \"It’s not for me. My sister asked me to bring them since she knows I have classmates in the Empire.\"\nDrexel rolled his eyes at Elio, then held out his hand. \"Medical expenses, please.\"\nFeeling guilty, Elio promptly transferred 1,000,000 astrocredits to Drexel’s account.\nHearing the notification, Drexel swallowed hard, surprised to actually receive the medical expenses—and a full 1,000,000 astrocredits!\nInstantly, Drexel’s pain disappeared, and he smiled brightly.\n\"Mr. Lasair, if you have more errands like this in the future, please do count me in! I’m a professional!\" Drexel said, still with his swollen pig face, blinking his puffy eyes.\nElio shuddered, quickly pushing Drexel away. \"Let’s talk about that later. Now that everyone’s here, let’s get down to business.\"\n\"Alright, Mr. Lasair, go ahead. We’re all ears,\" Drexel said, switching to a fawning mode.\nArix shook her head, smiling at Drexel’s greed. Once everyone was seated, Elio began explaining the situation.\n\"Here’s the deal. My family discovered a Star-Class energy mining planet at the border of the Alliance and the Empire. While mining, the Dragon clan found out and claimed the planet is on their territory. After a lot of back and forth, my family, the Lasairs, and the Dragon clan agreed to each send a mecha team for a competition. Whoever wins gets the mining planet,\" Elio explained.\nAs soon as he mentioend the Dragon clan, Arix and Drexel’s expressions turned sour. However, they stayed quiet and kept listening to Elio.\n\"The competition needs six people and is scheduled for next Saturday. It’s at the border between the Empire and the Alliance. Because we need mecha pilots from the young generation and the time is pressing, my family couldn’t find suitable mecha experts. So, I thought of you guys. I hope you are willing to help,\" Elio said, scratching the back of his head sheepishly.\nDrexel and the others had no objections. They were close friends with Elio, and the idea of facing the Empire’s warmongers made them eager to participate.\n\"Oh, right. If you agree to participate and we win, the Lasair family will reward each of you with 1 billion astrocredits. Even if we lose, each of you will still get 100 million astrocredits,\" Elio added, almost forgetting to mention the reward.\nEveryone’s eyes widened in surprise and excitement at the mention of such a generous reward.\nWhen Elio dropped that bombshell, everyone froze. Even Zephyr, busy cleaning his gun, stopped mid-motion.\nTen billion astrocredits! Enough for Zephyr to snag his dream gun.\nCirilla couldn’t keep her cool. Ten billion astrocredits! Enough to buy her dream car.\nVarden felt the pull too. Ten billion astrocredits! Enough to stockpile rare medical ingredients.\nArix gulped. Ten billion astrocredits! She could get all the materials she needed as a newbie mecha builder.\nDrexel’s breath quickened. Ten billion astrocredits! He wouldn’t even know how to spend it all before graduation.\nThe lure of that massive amount of money made everyone’s eyes sparkle with greed as they stared at Elio.\n\"I’ll go,\" Zephyr declared, his gaze icy and sharp.\n\"I’m in too,\" Cirilla jumped in without a second thought.\n\"If everyone’s going, I can’t just sit out. I’m in,\" Varden said, adjusting his frameless glasses.\n\"Let’s do this. Also, my physical power just hit Supergiant+. Can we get a bit more reward for that?\" Drexel asked, winking at Elio.\n\"What! Supergiant+?\" Elio was floored by Drexel’s strength, missing the rest of what he said. His eyes were wide with envy.\nThe others were equally stunned, all eyes on Drexel.\n\"Chill out, guys. Don’t follow my lead; I’m just a legend,\" Drexel said smugly, flicking his hair with a crooked smile on his bruised face. It was a weirdly comical sight.\nElio rolled his eyes, deciding Drexel wasn’t worth the jealousy.\nTurning to Arix, Elio asked, \"What about you, Arix? Last I checked, your physical power was Planet Class, right?\"\n\"My psychic power’s at Supergiant+, and my physical power’s Supergiant-Class now,\" Arix said nonchalantly.\nArix didn’t think much of it, but the others were shocked, except Drexel.",

      "content": "Chapter 163: Shouldering Responsibility\nCirilla reacted the most, rushing over to wrap her arm around Arix’s neck. \"Arix! Aren’t we best friends? How could you get so powerful without telling me?\"\n\"Huh? It’s not a big deal. You’re all Supergiant-Class too,\" Arix said, brushing it off.\n\"But we didn’t jump three levels in two months! Even Drexel leveled up,\" Cirilla grumbled, feeling a twinge of bitterness.\n\"Today, it’s clear. You two just came to show off,\" Elio said, a bit sour.\n\"Arix, it’s great your power’s improved. You can help out more,\" Varden said, grinning like he had a plan.\nArix didn’t need to read minds to catch Varden’s drift. She glanced at him but stayed silent. Varden’s rare smile showed his approval of her quiet acceptance.\n\"Exactly. With Arix and Mr. Kering’s boost in physical power, our chances in the competition are looking good,\" Elio said, nodding with satisfaction.\nArix was taken aback by her inclusion. \"Do I need to participate too? I’m new to mecha training and might slow everyone down. Maybe you should find someone else,\" she suggested.\n\"No need. It’s you, Arix,\" Elio declared.\n\"Isn’t this a bit casual?\" Arix frowned, feeling uneasy.\n\"Not at all. First, the six of us know each other well. Bringing in a stranger could mess up our teamwork,\" Elio explained, with Cirilla and the others nodding in agreement.\n\"Second, we have a week. We can take turns training Arix on the interstellarnet. She doesn’t need to be an expert, just good enough at attacking and escaping,\" Elio continued, looking at his friends who nodded in support.\n\"Third, it’s more than hard to find other powerful mecha pilots at our age. And that competition only allows the young ones in. Even if we find someone, it’s highly possible they’d be a beginner too. So, since we’ll get a beginner anyway, it might as well be Arix,\" Elio said, hitting the key point.\nArix laughed. If studying hard of one week could earn her ten billion astrocredits, she’d gladly do it multiple times until she bankrupted the Lasair family.\nAfter a while of discussing, they noticed it was late and decided to wrap up. It was weekday tomorrow, so Elio and the others had to take the warp machine back to the academy.\nThey set up a special chatting group, and Elio and his friends said their goodbyes to Arix and Drexel.\n\"If you need anything, message in the group. If there are no issues, we’ll have classes during the day and train on the interstellarnet at night this week,\" Elio reminded them before leaving.\n\"No problem, you’re the boss,\" Drexel said, giving an OK gesture.\nElio rolled his eyes and ignored Drexel. He and his friends got into his luxury Lev and headed for his space station.\nAfter seeing everyone off, Arix went to her room to pack. Unlike regular schools, the military academy required boarding. Students could only go home on weekends or holidays.\nSometimes, field exercises kept them on campus over weekends, so it was best to pack ahead. However, they could shop online on campus, so missing anything wasn’t a concern.\nDrexel had the same idea. Once back at the villa, the siblings went to their rooms to pack.\nArix went back to the room and freed Cupid and the gang. Then, Arix dumped a big pile of Space Buttons right in the middle of the bed.\nStaring at the buttons, Arix had no idea what each one held. Some of them from the Tiger clan, a few from Luna Amethyst; some from Cassian, and others from all sorts of friends and family.\nArix grabbed six of the biggest ones first. They started sorting stuff into the right Space Buttons. One for mecha parts, one for potion ingredients, one for food, one for daily stuff, one for Psychic Ware materials, and one for Drexel.\nThere were so many things to organize that even Cupid and the others chipped in to help. After nearly two hours, they finally got everything sorted out.\nExhausted, Arix and the helpers flopped onto the bed. Just then, Drexel’s voice called from outside, announcing dinner.\nArix took a deep breath and got up, thanking the helpers, \"Cupid, Vita, Sophia, thanks for the help today. You can head back now.\"\n\"Okay,\" they replied together, transforming into beams of red, blue, and green psychic power, then zipping back into Arix’s psychic world.\nArix strung the Space Buttons onto a silver necklace and put it around their neck before leaving the room.\nOpening the door, Arix handed Drexel a separate Space Button. \"Here, these are things I don’t need. They’re yours.\"\nDrexel’s eyes lit up. He hadn’t expected such a bonus just for calling Arix to dinner.\n\"Thanks, Arix,\" Drexel said, taking the button. Using his psychic power to peek inside, he saw a treasure trove: potions, Psychic Ware pieces, various weapons, and even a luxurious maglev car.\nDrexel’s eyes went wide, and he swallowed hard. This was worth almost a billion!\n\"A-Arix, are you sure about this?\" Drexel asked, his voice shaking with excitement.\n\"Yeah, if it’s too much, you can share some with others,\" Arix replied casually.\nNot wanting to share, Drexel quickly pocketed the button. \"No way, it’s not too much. Not at all. Arix, if you have more stuff you don’t need, just give it to me.\"\nArix rolled their eyes. \"These were gifts from other people, it’ll hurt the givers’ feelings if I sold them. That’s why I’m giving them to you. But anything I make myself goes up for sale on the interstellarnet. You’ll only get a cut of the profits.\"\n\"Getting a share of the profits is good too. So, next time you have something you don’t want, just give it to me,\" Drexel said, beaming.\nArix considered it. Selling gifts wasn’t right, but passing them on to her brother seemed fine. So, she nodded.\nSeeing Arix agree, Drexel could hardly contain his excitement. His enthusiasm left Arix a bit confused.\n’Why is he, heir to a prestigious family, so fixated on money—more so than me, who’ve spent ten years on Planet Waste?’\nWhen they reached the dining room, the whole Kering family was gathered, including Matis, who was usually busy with the legion.\n\"Grandpa, Kellan, you’re both back too!\" Arix called out happily.\n\"How could I not come back when my precious granddaughter is here?\" Matis replied cheerfully, waving and motioning for Arix to sit beside him.\n\"Arix looks much prettier,\" Kellan said with a warm smile.\nArix sat next to Matis and grinned at her Kellan across the table. \"Thanks, Kellan. You look good too.\"\n\"Everyone’s here. We should start serving dinner,\" Fleur said, her rare good mood making her seem unusually gentle. She even made salad for Drexel.\nDinner was filled with laughter and joy. After the meal, Matis called Arix to the study.\n\"Arix, you start classes tomorrow. I heard old Gunder assigned you to five departments. Do you want me to help you drop a few?\" Matis asked, concerned.\nArix thought for a moment, then shook her head. \"No need, Grandpa. The Department of Chemistry and the Psychic Ware Department will help me research upgraded psychic power healing potions. The Department of Mecha Manufacture is my hobby. The Department of Combat is essential in an era plagued by insectoids—weakness is a sin. As for the Department of Strategy and Commanding, you know, Grandpa, with my talents, I won’t just be a simple soldier or a quiet researcher.\"\nMatis felt a pang of sorrow for his granddaughter, who understood so much.\nBeing born into the Kering family with such talents meant she could never be truly free. When Arix decided to return to the family, she was bound by countless responsibilities. Choosing to become an Alliance soldier added even more.\nAs a little tiger, Arix could laugh and play freely. But as Arix of the Kering family, her every word and action influenced the fate of many, including their lives, fortunes, and misfortunes.\nLooking at Arix, still a child but mature beyond her years, Matis’s eyes grew moist. He smiled proudly, saying, \"Arix, you will always be my pride.\"\nTouched by his words, Arix walked over and hugged Matis’s arm, sweetly saying, \"Grandpa, you are the kind of guy I always dreamt to be.\"\nDelighted by his precious granddaughter, Matis laughed heartily. \"Aren’t you a little sweet talker?\"\nSeeing Matis no longer sad, Arix smiled as well. Then, with a mysterious look, she changed the topic. \"Grandpa, do you want to know how Arix Crystal is made?\"\nMatis’s curiosity was piqued. \"Of course, I do! Tell me all about it,\" he replied, eager to hear the story behind the special crystal.",

      "content": "Chapter 164: Meeting The Three Little Ones\nMatis raised an eyebrow, thinking Arix was about to show him how to make Arix Crystals.\nCurious, he nodded and asked, \"I don’t know. Can you tell me?\"\nWith a mysterious smile and a wink, Arix replied, \"You’ll know in a moment, Grandpa.\"\nMatis chuckled and tapped Arix’s forehead affectionately. \"Haha, you’re just teasing me now.\"\nArix giggled, \"Don’t rush, Grandpa. Did you bring the Insectoid Core the legion needs?\"\n\"Yes,\" Matis confirmed, pulling out a Space Button and a piece of paper filled with notes, handing them to Arix.\n\"Arix, these are the Arix Crystals the legion needs. There’s quite a lot, so take your time making them. No need to hurry,\" Matis advised with concern.\nArix nodded, took the paper and Space Button. He memorized the contents, and then put it all into her own Space Button.\n\"Grandpa, it’s time to witness a miracle. Cupid, Vita, Sophia, come out and meet Grandpa,\" Arix said, summoning three little tigers with wings.\nThe cute little tigers appeared on Matis’s desk.\nMatis’s eyelids trembled slightly at the sight. He had guessed Arix might have a Psychic Incarnation, but seeing them was still surprising.\nPsychic Incarnations were common among the five noble families, but each generation usually had only one youth with it.\nNow the Kering family had two kids with Psychic Incarnations, and that was totally out of Matis’ expectation. It was like a family that always had one child per generation suddenly having twins. It brought both joy and surprise.\nWith mixed feelings, Matis greeted the three little tigers, \"Hello, little ones.\"\n\"Hello, Grandpa,\" the three tigers responded, placing their paws on Matis’s palm with cute sounds.\nThough Matis didn’t understand their words, he guessed their meaning. He gently patted their small heads, and Cupid even enjoyed rubbing against his palm.\n\"Grandpa, why don’t you look surprised?\" Arix asked, puzzled.\nMatis looked at Arix, confused. \"What’s there to be surprised about?\"\n\"Cupid and the others are Psychic Incarnations! Shouldn’t you be amazed and astonished?\" Arix exclaimed, showing an exaggerated expression of astonishment.\nMatis laughed at her acting. Shaking his head affectionately, he said, \"Drexel also has a Psychic Incarnation, a little tiger named Sheer, I think.\"\n\"Drexel has one too?!\" Arix was genuinely astonished this time.\n\"Not just Drexel. All five noble families have them. Even your father has one, but he’s a two-tailed cat named Phantom,\" Matis added, as if that wasn’t enough of a shock.\nArix’s eyes widened dramatically, as if she’d just swallowed a giant elephant. When she looked back at Matis, her eyes had changed.\n\"Grandpa, do you and Kellan also have one?\" she asked, doubting everything.\n\"I do, but Kellan doesn’t,\" Matis said, shaking his head with a smile.\n\"Why doesn’t Kellan have one? Is he adopted?\" Arix held her face in her hands, her imagination running wild.\nShe started thinking maybe Kellan was the orphaned child of a friend and was adopted by her kind-hearted parents. Or perhaps he was the heir of another family, sent to the Kering family for protection. Or maybe he was a cute little beggar her parents found and decided to adopt...\nMatis almost laughed at her wild thoughts. \"If Kellan heard you say that, he’d definitely give you a good scolding.\"\nArix sheepishly touched her nose. \"It’s just that everyone has one except him. It seems strange.\"\nMatis shook his head. \"Kellan perfectly inherited his grandmother——my wife’s ability, so the Kering family’s Psychic Incarnation and your mother’s bloodline couldn’t be passed on to him.\"\n\"Did Grandma have an ability?\" Arix asked. She knew she had a grandmother named Frances, but Frances had passed away many years ago, so she didn’t know much about her.\nMatis’s eyes softened, and his voice carried a noticeable trace of longing. \"Frances’s ability was both a blessing and a curse. But let’s not dwell on that. Arix, you haven’t shown me how to make Arix Crystals yet, and I’m getting getting impatient.\"\nSeeing that Matis didn’t want to talk about it, Arix wisely changed the subject. \"Okay, Grandpa, just wait a moment.\"\nArix handed the Space Button filled with Insectoid Cores to Cupid and said, \"Cupid, it’s your turn.\"\n\"No problem,\" Cupid nodded, wagging his tail happily as he hugged the Space Button.\nRight in front of them, Cupid started munching on the Insectoid Cores.\nAt first, Matis watched Cupid eat with a calm expression, though slightly puzzled. But as Cupid ate box after box without stopping, Matis’s expression grew more and more unusual.\n\"Arix, is it okay for the little one to eat so much? Won’t the Psychic Incarnation get damaged?\" Matis asked, frowning with worry.\n\"Grandpa, it’s fine. Cupid only eats the violent psychic power inside the Insectoid Cores, so it just looks like he’s eating a lot,\" Arix explained with a smile, watching Cupid devour the cores.\n\"Oh, that’s good,\" Matis sighed in relief. Then he looked at Arix curiously. \"Arix, why haven’t you started making the Arix Crystals yet?\"\n\"Hmm? I’ve already started,\" Arix said innocently, blinking her eyes.\nMatis looked at her, noting she hadn’t moved her feet, hands, or even used any psychic power. For the first time, he blew his beard in exasperation at Arix. \"I am not that old yet. Don’t try to fool me. You haven’t done anything.\"\n\"Ah! Grandpa, you think I’m the one making the Arix Crystals, don’t you?\" Arix finally realized.\n\"If it’s not you, then is it this little guy?\" Matis rolled his eyes and pointed at Cupid.\nTo his surprise, Arix nodded. \"Yes, it’s Cupid.\"\nArix and Matis locked eyes for a moment.\nThen Cupid let out a loud burp, got up, and hopped to the corner of the study, sniffing around.\nFinally, Cupid found a spot he liked and pulled out a large box designed for storing Arix Crystals.\n\"Arix, what is Cupid up to? If he needs to use the bathroom, he should do that elsewhere. This box is for Arix Crystals, using it as a potty is a waste,\" Matis said, feeling a bit upset.\nThis box was crafted with space stone and Supergiant-Class isolation materials. Each one cost ten million astrocredits.\nEven though the Kering family was rich, it still stung a little.\n\"Grandpa, Cupid is putting Arix Crystals in the box,\" Arix said innocently.\nMatis just stood there, speechless.\nThis sounded way too absurd.\nHis lips moved, but he couldn’t bring himself to scold Arix.\nHe sighed inwardly and gave up.\n’Fine, if it makes Arix happy, I can live with it even if the box is used as a potty.’\nWatching Cupid open the box and prepare to use it as his potty, Matis’ mouth twitched. He quickly looked away.\nAt least if he didn’t see it, it wouldn’t hurt as much.\n\"Grandpa, why aren’t you watching Cupid?\" Arix reminded him, noticing Matis seemed distracted.\nAfter all, Cupid was about to produce Arix Crystals. It would be a shame to miss it.\nMatis took a deep breath and then turned to Arix with a strained smile. \"I’m watching, I’m watching it now.\"\n’It’s just watching ten million astrocredits being wasted, right?’\nHe used to fight insectoids on battlefields and never got afraid. He didn’t know why he felt a bit nervous to watch this.\nMatis clutched his chest, ready to rub it when the heartache came.\nCupid stepped on the edge of the box a few times to make sure it was stable.\nIn Matis’ horrified gaze, he squatted on the Arix Crystal box.\nThen thousands of Arix Crystals poured out of Cupid.\nFeeling relieved with an empty stomach, Cupid sighed contentedly.\nThen he flew up, kicked the box closed, and went back to munching on an Insectoid Core.\nAfter witnessing how Arix Crystals were made, Matis stood frozen as if struck by lightning.\nRemembering that he had once drunk a potion made from these crystals, he closed his eyes in desperation.\n\"Cupid is really amazing, right?\" Arix said, oblivious to Matis’ desperation. Her tone carried a hint of pride.\n\"Well... yeah... amazing... so amazing,\" Matis stammered, his mind filled with the image of the steaming Arix Crystals.\n\"Hehe.\" Arix blushed a little, feeling shy from the praise.\nRemembering she had to go to military school tomorrow, she decided to turn in early.\n\"Grandpa, it’s getting late. I’m going to my room to sleep,\" Arix said, bidding Matis goodnight.",

Matis, why are you contacting me so late?\" Admiral Virek of the Third Legion appeared on the 3D screen, looking at Matis with a touch of disdain.\nYesterday, Virek had asked Matis for some psychic power healing potions, but the old miser had been reluctant and said he’d think about it. Hmph, hypocrite. He just wanted more benefits.\n\"Virek, I remember you wanted some psychic power healing potions from me, right?\" Matis asked, his tone resigned and world-weary.\nVirek raised an eyebrow. This stingy guy was actually bringing it up himself. Maybe he had a chance today.\nSoftening his tone, he replied, \"That’s right. So, are you giving them to me?\"\n\"How many do you want?\" Matis asked calmly.\nVirek hesitated, sensing something was off with Matis today.\nBut missing out on this opportunity would be foolish.\n\"I want 100,000 vials of Psychic Healer! Of course, I won’t take them for free. I’ll give you 200,000 Insectoid Cores, enough to make over 500,000 vials of Psychic Healer. I’ll also send you 150,000 units of medical ingredients. If you agree, I’ll send someone over today!\" Virek said, showing his sincerity, worried Matis might refuse.\nHe had just spoken when he felt Matis might disagree and was about to sweeten the deal.\nAfter all, psychic power healers were always in short supply in the legion.\nBut to his surprise, Matis nodded decisively and said, \"Okay, send someone over to collect them.\"\nVirek was stunned.\nThe mood was one of mutual satisfaction, but both men fell silent.\nLooking at the unusually agreeable Matis, Virek felt like he had seen a shapeshifting goblin.\nHis face twisted for a moment before he awkwardly asked, \"Uh, I’ll arrange for someone to pick them up tomorrow. Matis, we’ve known each other for decades. Be honest with me, are you in trouble? Do you need my help with anything?\"\nAlthough he was just asking, Virek was 80% sure Matis had run into some trouble. But since Matis was being so generous with the potions, Virek figured he could reluctantly offer some help to ease his mind.\nHearing Virek’s words, Matis finally looked up. His expression turned very serious as he gazed at Virek.\nThis intense stare made Virek inexplicably nervous, and he shifted uncomfortably.\nFeeling he was losing his composure, he coughed deliberately and pretended to be impatient. \"Well, say something. I’m very busy! If you don’t speak, I’ll hang up.\"\n\"Have you ever drunk psychic power healing potion?\" Matis suddenly asked, seemingly out of nowhere.\n\"Of course I have. What’s so strange about that? It would be strange if I hadn’t,\" Virek replied, looking at Matis in confusion.\n\"Oh, then I’m relieved. Goodbye, old man. I’m going to sleep.\" Matis seemed to have figured something out, his face relaxing. He raised his hand and turned off the opticomputer.\n\"What are you relieved about?\" Virek was bewildered.\nJust as he was about to ask for clarification, the screen went black.\nFar away in the Third Legion, Virek was so angry that he almost crushed his opticomputer.\nThat old prick is so annoying! He swore he’d never show any concern to him ever again!\n...\nThe next day, Arix and Drexel showed up early at Hecaris Military Academy, gearing up for a busy day ahead.\nDespite the early hour before classes kicked off, the gate was already buzzing with students returning to campus.\nAs soon as Arix and Drexel arrived, the waiting military students, bored in line, were instantly captivated by their stunning looks. Some even snapped sneaky photos and posted them on the campus network.\nThe online reaction was immediate. The pretty and handsome duo sparked a flurry of conversation among the students.\n\"HandsomeGuyAlert: Who’s this beautiful girl with Arix’s brother?\"\n\"NotYourBae: Maybe she’s Drexel’s girlfriend?\"\n\"CoolBreeze: Be careful. What if she’s Drexel’s sister, I mean, like another sister?\"\n\"TooCoolToWalk: Not a sister this time. Look at her hair and eyes; she’s from the Empire.\"\n\"TopLunchStealer: Quit guessing. It’s Arix herself. I heard it when she scanned her ID at the gate.\"\nThat last comment caused a brief silence on the campus network, quickly followed by an explosion of surprised messages.\nAt the academy gate, students queued up, scanning their IDs to enter. When Arix’s turn came, she lifted her hand and used her opticomputer to scan. A mechanical voice confirmed her identity.\n\"Identity confirmed, HMA freshman Arix Kering, please enter.\"\nThose nearby who heard the announcement turned to look at her in surprise. They might not all recognize her by sight, but her name was well-known. Arix was the one who had saved many students during the insectoid attack.\nSuddenly, admiring and fascinated eyes were on her. Among these admirers were a pair of siblings dressed in ragged clothes. Without Space Buttons, they had to carry their large bags, waiting in line.\nTheir shabby appearance drew disdainful looks from some students. The sister was dressed decently without patches, but the brother’s clothes were a patchwork of old fabric pieces.\n\"Mark, that’s Arix, right? She’s so pretty,\" said Deanna, a skinny girl with dark skin, watching Arix walk away enviously.\n\"You’re pretty too,\" Marceau replied, gently stroking Deanna’s hair with his scarred hand.\nDeanna turned to her brother and flashed a sweet smile, but her lack of attention caused her to bump into the girl in front of her.\nBefore Deanna could react, the girl shoved her away in disgust.\nMarceau caught his sister before she fell, his eyes cold as he glared at the girl, raising his hand. He was ready to strike.\nDeanna quickly grabbed Marceau’s hand, shaking her head. She apologized, \"I’m sorry, I didn’t notice.\"\n\"You think you can get away just like that? The coffee’s all over my sleeve! You ruined my new dress, now pay up,\" the girl demanded, refusing to let it go.\n\"I bumped into you, but the coffee got on your dress just when you shoved me,\" Deanna replied, feeling a headache coming on. She knew she had run into trouble again.\n\"Are you talking back to me? Who do you think you are? Trash from Planet Void?\" the girl retorted with disgust, eyeing the siblings with disdain.\nHearing they were from Planet Void, the onlookers lost any inclination to help. Some just watched, while a few supported the girl. Others, unfamiliar with the situation, asked, \"Aren’t people from Planet Void not allowed out? How did they get into the military academy?\"\n\"Yeah, I thought Planet Void was for serious criminals. Once you’re in, you can’t get out,\" another student said, puzzled.\n\"Not sure about the details, but there’s only one way out of Planet Void. If they aren’t serious criminals but the children of criminals, and if they have exceptional talent, they can come to the academy after passing certain tests. If they earn military honors, they don’t have to go back to Planet Void,\" explained a student with some inside knowledge.\n\"No way, do we have to go to school with criminals’ kids? That’s disgusting.\"\n\"How good can criminals’ kids be? What if they hurt us?\"\n\"Don’t worry, they won’t dare harm us unless they want to go back to Planet Void.\"\n\"That’s good to know.\"\nSurrounded by hostility, Marceau’s eyes turned red, biting his lip so hard it bled.\nIf not for his sister’s restraining hand, he might have lashed out.\nThis was so unfair. Being born there wasn’t an option for them, and for the past of their lives, they were either scavenging for scraps to survive, or hiding from criminals.\nThinking about the miserable life on Planet Void and his sister’s happy smile since leaving it, Marceau clenched his teeth and held back his anger.\nHe could return to Planet Void himself, but he couldn’t drag his sister back to that terrible place.\nMarceau forced himself to suppress his rage and said to the troublesome girl, \"How much? We’ll pay you.\"\n\"Hmph, how can I be sure if your money’s clean? I’ve changed my mind. If you polish the dirt off my shoes and say sorry, I’ll let it go,\" the girl sneered, looking at them like they were filthy rats.\nThe students watching were visibly uncomfortable with the girl’s words. Even if Marceau and Deanna were children of criminals, this was crossing a line.\nBut Marceau didn’t get angry. He had survived worse. For his sister, he could endure anything.\nHis eyes went dull as he stepped forward, but Deanna quickly stopped him.\n\"Mark, let’s just go back to Planet Void,\" Deanna said, her thin hand holding his scarred one, trying to force a smile.\nMarceau looked at his sister’s gaunt face and then the girl standing in front of them. His heart ached with the realization of his helplessness.\nHe longed to give his sister a happy, but it seemed impossible. No matter how hard he tried, it just wasn’t enough.",

      "content": "Chapter 166: New Beginning\nJust when Marceau was feeling hopeless and Deanna was ready to give in, a friendly voice broke through the tension.\n\"Hey, you two, it looks like you’re being blackmailed. Want me to call the cops?\" Arix asked, smiling warmly at Deanna and her brother.\nTurns out the commotion had caught Arix’s attention. She and Drexel had come back to see what was going on and witnessed the whole scene.\nDrexel stood behind Arix, watching with keen interest. Seeing Arix get riled up was a rare treat. This was going to be fun.\nDeanna was so shocked to see Arix that she couldn’t find her voice. Marceau, too, was taken aback, his mouth moving but no words coming out.\nWhen neither of the siblings responded, Arix shifted her gaze to the girl who was blackmailing them. \"Do you know how many school rules you’ve broken today? Let’s see, blackmail, bullying... I won’t list them all. But if I report this, do you think you’ll get a major demerit or be expelled?\"\nArix spoke with a gentle tone, but her words made the blackmailing girl shiver.\n\"I’m sorry, I was wrong,\" the girl quickly apologized to Arix.\nShe knew better than to mess with Arix, a well-known figure at HMA. Crossing her could mean serious trouble.\n\"You should apologize to them, not me,\" Arix hinted.\nThe girl bit her lip, then apologized to Deanna and Marceau before bolting away like a scared rabbit.\nWatching her flee, Arix sighed and muttered to other students, \"Don’t judge others without knowing their struggles. We’re all classmates and future comrades. In my eyes, only the weak turn on their own, and we’re not.\"\nArix’s words struck a chord, and the students around fell silent, reflecting on what she had said. Some got the message and approached Deanna and Marceau to apologize.\n\"Sorry we didn’t help you earlier,\" one student said.\nDeanna, still surprised, replied, \"It’s okay, I don’t blame you.\"\nThe apologizing student’s eyes welled up, and after bowing, they quietly left. Seeing this, others began to step forward and apologize as well.\nArix watched as Deanna and Marceau were surrounded by classmates, looking a bit overwhelmed by all the apologies. With a smile, she turned and said, \"Drexel, let’s go.\"\n\"Yes, let’s,\" Drexel agreed. \"We still need to visit the office to get our dorm assignments and uniforms.\" He followed Arix as they headed towards the administration building.\nNot long after Arix and Drexel left, Deanna and Marceau finally managed to break free from their classmates. They looked around, wanting to thank Arix, but she was nowhere to be found.\n\"They’ve already left,\" Marceau said, feeling a mix of emotions.\nIn his mind, no one besides his sister had ever been kind to him. But today, he realized he might have been wrong. Maybe there were kind people in the world; he just hadn’t been lucky enough to meet them before.\n\"We didn’t get to thank them properly,\" Deanna said with regret.\n\"There will be another chance,\" Marceau reassured her, giving her a comforting pat on the head.\n...\nIn the office, Drexel pointed at Arix, looking at the administrator with dissatisfaction. \"Sir, this is unfair! My sister gets a private dorm, but I have to share with four? Isn’t this double standards?\"\nThe administrator calmly asked, \"Were you the top scorer in the entrance exam?\"\nDrexel’s confidence deflated, and he replied honestly, \"No...\"\nThe administrator nodded and asked, \"Do you have a rank in the Fifth Legion?\"\n\"No...\" Drexel’s shoulders slumped further.\nThe administrator nodded again and asked, \"Do you have the highest honor medal from the Alliance?\"\nBy this point, even the administrator looked a bit envious, let alone Drexel, who was still a student.\n\"Okay, okay, I get it. I’ll stay in the dorm,\" Drexel said, his eyes filling with tears as he felt deeply wronged.\nListening to the conversation, Arix covered her face in embarrassment.\nAfter leaving the office, Arix noticed Drexel still looked a bit down. She finally spoke up, \"If you don’t want to stay in the dorm, you can come live with me.\"\nArix’s dorm was a two-story villa, plenty big for both of them to have their own floor.\nDrexel patted Arix’s head and said, \"Thanks, Arix, but I already promised my friends I’d stay with them.\"\n\"Your friends?\" Arix asked, puzzled.\n\"Hehe, they are my two good buddies I grew up with. Come on, I’ll introduce you to them,\" Drexel said, smiling and eager.\nArix, curious, followed Drexel to the young men’s dormitory.\nThe dorms at HMA were divided into three main areas: the boys’ dorms on the left, the girls’ dorms on the right, and the staff residence in the middle.\nThe teachers live in cozy villas, while the students stay in high-rise buildings. Each floor has three dorms, each over 150 square meters, with four bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen, and a bathroom.\nAlthough not entirely separate, each student has their own bedroom, providing enough space for privacy.\nAs Arix walked through the campus, she ran into several familiar classmates. They exchanged quick hellos and went on their way.\nWhen she spotted Calista, Arix was about to say hi but froze in her tracks, nearly stunned.\nCalista and Dae-jung were holding hands, chatting and laughing. Arix noticed Calista’s happy smile and Dae-jung’s usually reserved but now affectionate gaze.\nIt was clear what was happening: Drexel’s little admirer had been swept away by someone else.\nDrexel, meanwhile, was smiling and about to greet the pair, but Arix quickly covered his mouth.\nDrexel looked at her, confused.\n...\nWhen Calista and Dae-jung walked away, Arix finally let out a sigh of relief. She removed her hand from Drexel’s mouth.\n\"Arix, why’d you cover my mouth?\" Drexel asked, clearly puzzled.\nArix gave him a look that was hard to read. \"Your little admirer is gone.\"\nDrexel frowned, confused. \"What admirer? Which one?\"\nHe had plenty of admirers, so he wasn’t sure who she meant.\nArix just rolled her eyes.\n’Ugh, what a jerk!’\nShe felt no sympathy now.\nWith a disdainful glance, she snorted and headed towards the boy’s dormitory alone.\nDrexel stood there, baffled by his sister’s sudden mood change.\n’Women,’\nhe thought,\n’their moods change faster than billboards.’\nShaking his head, he quickly followed her. They soon reached Drexel’s dorm building, a towering structure with 99 floors, elegantly decorated with large sofas and a coffee table in the lobby.\nWithout lingering, they took the floating elevator to the 30th floor, stopping at dorm number 3003. Drexel scanned his opticomputer at the sensor, and the door opened with a cheerful \"Welcome home\" from an electronic voice.\nDrexel motioned for his sister to enter first, but he noticed two figures rushing towards them. Before Arix could react, Drexel stopped the kids with a hand on each.\n\"Hey, Drexel! You went to the Empire and left us behind!\" Kael cried, looking betrayed.\n\"Yeah, and why are you back today? We thought you’d been kidnapped by some beauty from the Empire!\" Tevian joked.\nDrexel coughed, trying to be serious. \"Ahem, guys, my sister’s here today.\" He tilted his head to reveal Arix behind him.\nTevian and Kael’s eyes widened in confusion, then shock.\nThe two of them exchanged dumbfounded looks and vanished into their rooms in a flash.\nArix, puzzled, asked Drexel, \"What’s with them?\"\nDrexel shrugged and motioned her inside. \"Never mind them. Come in and sit down.\"\nArix nodded and had just settled in the living room when Kael and Tevian emerged from their rooms, now neatly dressed. One held flowers, and the other a gift.\n\"Hello, Arix. I’m Kael, your brother’s best buddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you,\" Kael said, handing her the flowers with a polite smile.\n\"Hello, I’m also your brother’s best buddy. I’m Tevian. Nice to meet you,\" Tevian said with a grin, handing a gift to Arix.",

      "content": "Chapter 167: Planet Void\nArix raised an eyebrow, amused at how different Kael and Tevian seemed now. She politely accepted the flowers and the gift.\nSmiling, she nodded and said, \"Thanks, Kael and Tevian. Just call me Arix. It’s nice to meet you too.\"\nSeeing Arix accept the gifts, Kael and Tevian relaxed. It seemed Arix wouldn’t be hard to get along with.\nAfter some chatting, Drexel asked, \"Where’s our other roommate?\"\n\"He should be here, probably in his room,\" Kael replied, remembering a door opening earlier.\n\"I’ve met the new guy. He’s not very friendly, pretty cold,\" Tevian said, recalling the classmate with eyes like ice. He shivered at the thought.\n\"Come on, you guys are too timid. We’ll be living together for the next four years. What’s there to be afraid of?\" Drexel teased.\nA bedroom door opening interrupted them.\n\"Here he comes, the new roommate,\" Tevian said, winking.\nEveryone, including Arix, looked over curiously.\nA guy and a girl emerged.\nArix and Drexel recognized them right away. They were the siblings from Planet Void, Deanna and Marceau.\nDeanna looked surprised and froze at seeing so many people. Marceau’s face turned cold, but when he saw Arix, his demeanor softened a bit. He nodded politely at her, even greeting her.\nArix was momentarily stunned before she realized he was greeting her. She nodded back.\nUnlike her brother, Deanna looked at Arix with pleasant surprise. \"Hello, nice to see you again. I’m Deanna. Can we get to know each other?\"\nArix found the siblings interesting and smiled. \"Sure, I’m Arix. Nice to meet you.\"\nDeanna’s smile grew wider. \"I’m very happy to meet you too. I’ve heard a lot about you. Arix, I really like you. Can we exchange contact information?\" Deanna’s eyes sparkled, like she was meeting a celebrity.\n\"Of course, Deanna. You’re very sweet,\" Arix replied, not wanting to refuse the charming girl.\nWhen Arix noticed Deanna’s brand-new opticomputer, she was taken aback. If she remembered correctly, that model cost around 100,000 astrocredits.\nDeanna noticed Arix’s surprise and smiled shyly. \"Back on Planet Void, we didn’t use opticomputers. This one was lent to us by a soldier named Thaddeus Kering. He said we couldn’t be without one out here.\"\n\"Hmm? Thaddeus? Deanna, are you talking about this guy?\" Arix asked, a bit shocked. She pulled up a photo of her father on her own opticomputer.\n\"Hey, isn’t that him? Do you know Mr. Kering? My brother and I nearly died on Planet Void, and he saved us,\" Deanna exclaimed the moment she saw the photo.\nThe man in the photo was the very soldier who had rescued her and her brother.\nHearing the name Thaddeus, Drexel glanced over. Kael and Tevian, also taken aback, exchanged surprised looks.\n’Could it really be such a coincidence?’\nMarceau turned to Arix and thought of her last name, Kering. He had a hunch but was too shy to voice it.\nBefore Arix could respond, Kael jumped in eagerly.\n\"Deanna, these two are the kids of Mr. Kering,\" Kael said, pointing at Arix and Drexel.\nDeanna looked at Arix in surprise and asked, \"Really? Arix, you’re Mr. Kering’s daughter?\"\nArix nodded and replied, \"Yes, he’s our dad.\"\n\"But why did Mr. Kering say I look like his daughter? Arix, you’re so beautiful, and I look nothing like you,\" Deanna recalled how Mr. Kering had been stunned when he saw her over a month ago.\nArix understood. She sighed, touching her nose as she looked at the thin Deanna, who resembled how Arix looked when she first returned.\nAfter Arix explained, Deanna found it both funny and sad. She held Arix’s hand and said, \"I had no idea you went through that. From now on, you can come to me if you need anything from me, if any...\"\nSeeing the young woman who seemed even frailer than herself, Arix’s eyes softened. She squeezed Deanna’s hand gratefully and said, \"Thank you, Deanna!\"\nThe two girls smiled at each other and began chatting away, forgetting about Marceau, who was supposed to walk his sister back to the dorm.\nNoticing Marceau standing alone, Drexel thought of his own experiences of being overlooked by their dad.\nOut of sympathy and a desire to make amends, Drexel pulled Marceau over and introduced himself. \"I’m Drexel, and these are my buddies, Kael and Tevian. What’s your name, man?\"\nMarceau looked at Drexel for a moment, then lowered his gaze and replied coolly, \"Marceau.\"\n\"Great name, but from now on, we’ll call you Cool Guy,\" Drexel said, throwing an arm around Marceau’s shoulder.\nMarceau didn’t say anything, but his already cool demeanor became even cooler.\nHe didn’t like the name, but his shy nature kept him from saying so. So, \"Cool Guy\" stuck, much to his chagrin. As his roommates kept calling him that, Marceau’s face grew colder.\nEven though Drexel and the others did all the talking, Marceau stayed silent.\nDespite his lack of response, Drexel and his friends chatted away without feeling awkward.\nMarceau wasn’t interested in their small talk; instead, he focused on Drexel’s hand on his shoulder, his cold eyes wishing they could freeze it off.\nMarceau disliked being close to people, but Drexel had been sticking to him like a piece of chewing gum.\nRemembering that Drexel was Arix’s brother and the son of the man who saved them, Marceau resisted the urge to push his hand away.\nDrexel noticed and teasingly raised an eyebrow, becoming even more annoying by patting Marceau’s head.\nMarceau’s face darkened further as he tried to endure Drexel’s antics, his frustrated yet restrained look amusing Drexel.\nFinally, when Deanna and Arix announced they were leaving, Drexel stopped his teasing.\nMarceau felt a wave of relief. His deep, clear eyes silently communicated with his sister. Deanna shook her head and smiled, \"No need, Mark. I’ll go back with Arix.\"\nMarceau watched the two girls holding hands, then lowered his eyes to hide his emotions and said, \"Okay.\"\nWith her brother’s approval, Deanna excitedly took Arix’s hand and said goodbye to everyone.\nAs they left the dormitory, Deanna and Arix walked and chatted, drawing curious looks from their classmates.\n\"Deanna, how did you meet my dad?\" Arix asked curiously.\n\"Mr. Kering, huh? It started a little over a month ago when my brother and I were still on Planet Void...\" Deanna began to recall.\nPlanet Void was a harsh place where the Alliance imprisons dangerous criminals or temporarily holds those sentenced to death. The inhabitants were vicious criminals or ruthless individuals. Due to the lack of resources on the planet, even cannibalism was common.\nOnce people entered Planet Void, getting out was nearly impossible.\nHowever, there was a special group of people who can earn their way out by gaining military merits.\nThese special individuals are the children born to the criminals on Planet Void.\nThe children of criminals were sent to a shelter on Planet Void after birth, where the Alliance government raised them. Their talents were assessed, determining their future.\nThose with average talents stayed in the shelter until they turned 18. At that point, they could choose to join the Alliance military.\nThe joining gave them a chance to earn enough military merits to leave Planet Void.\nAlso, those with exceptional talents, like Deanna and Marceau, got the opportunity to attend military school. This opportunity, though, brought endless danger. Since they were awarded the two spots, they faced repeated attempts on their lives. The last time, they almost didn’t make it.\nThankfully, Thaddeus was passing by on a mission to eliminate someone, and he saved them.",

      "content": "Chapter 168: Private Dorm\nAfter hearing Deanna’s story, Arix felt a wave of emotions. If she’d ended up on Planet Void instead of Planet Waste with Sister Gwen, her survival might have been in question.\nNoticing the concern on Arix’s face, Deanna asked, \"Arix, are you scared?\"\n\"Yes,\" Arix replied honestly, then gently took Deanna’s arm and asked, \"Deanna, have you ever been scared?\"\nDeanna smiled, her eyes twinkling like stars. \"No, because I have my brother.\"\n\"I see, you and your brother are really close,\" Arix thought about Marceau, who also adored his sister, and felt a bit envious. But she also felt glad, because she knew she had two wonderful brothers as well. Kellan was always kind and caring, and even though Drexel could be unreliable at times, Arix knew he was also the best brother anyone could ask for.\n\"Yes, my brother is amazing. I hope I can be his bride one day,\" Deanna said dreamily.\n\"To be a bride... wait, what?!\" Arix, still thinking about her own brothers, suddenly realized something was off. She nearly passed out from the shock.\n\"Deanna... um, siblings... can’t fall in love or get married,\" Arix said nervously, swallowing hard. She worried her words might be too harsh and struggled to find a gentle way to say it.\nDeanna saw Arix’s distressed expression and laughed, \"I know that, but he’s not my biological brother.\"\nHearing this, Arix let out a sigh of relief and said, not yet recovering from a fright, \"You could have mentioned that earlier. You nearly gave me a heart attack.\"\nDeanna giggled at Arix’s reaction.\nFeeling more at ease, Arix asked, \"So how do you meet each other? How did he become your brother?\"\n\"Because I was abandoned at birth, and he found me and took me to the orphanage. So, everyone just assumed I was his sister,\" Deanna explained, sounding like she was telling someone else’s story, without a trace of sadness.\nArix felt a pang of sympathy and gently rubbed Deanna’s head, comforting her, \"It’s all in the past. I believe you’ll be very happy in the future, Deanna.\"\n\"Thank you, Arix. But my brother only sees me as his sister now,\" Deanna said, looking a bit down.\n\"Hmm? Marceau hasn’t agreed yet? You’re so adorable,\" Arix said, surprised.\nDeanna shook her head sadly and confessed to Arix, \"Actually, I haven’t told my brother how I feel. I’m scared he might reject me, and I don’t want to burden him.\"\nOn Planet Void, just surviving was a luxury. Deanna, protected by her brother, had the rare luxury of dreaming about fairy tales.\nMarceau’s only concern was keeping his sister safe. But Deanna wanted more; she dreamed of being the one who could stay by his side forever.\n\"Are you planning to keep things this way?\" Arix asked with a sigh, seeing Deanna’s sadness. She wasn’t sure how to comfort her since she had never been in the same position.\nArix imagined it might be like her love for mechas. If she had to part with her Star Dust, it would indeed be a heart-wrenching feeling.\nThinking of this, Arix touched the Space Button hanging around her neck. Its cool touch reassured her and made her feel happy.\nDeanna, hearing Arix’s question, replied confidently, \"Of course not! I plan to confess to him as soon as I earn enough military merits to completely get rid of Planet Void with him.\"\nAs she spoke, Deanna clenched her fists, her eyes burning with determination.\n\"That sounds wonderful. It will be very romantic,\" Arix said, feeling a bit excited.\n\"Definitely! Arix, you have to cheer for me then,\" Deanna said with a bright smile.\n\"Sure,\" Arix replied, smiling back. She didn’t fully understand what it felt like, but seeing Deanna so happy made her happy too.\n\"By the way, Arix, do you have someone you like?\" Deanna asked, curious if someone as amazing as Arix had someone special in her life.\nSomeone she liked? The first person Arix thought of was Cassian, the second was Scion, and surprisingly, the third was Quispe.\nThough Quispe was handsome, his eccentric personality and insectoid nature made Arix shudder. She quickly shook her head, \"No, no, I don’t have anyone I like.\"\nDeanna looked puzzled by Arix’s frightened reaction, wondering if Arix had misheard her question as asking if there was someone she was scared of.\nSeeing Deanna’s confused expression, Arix didn’t want to explain her awkward thoughts. She nervously changed the subject, \"We’re almost at the girls’ dorm. Let me walk you up.\"\nDeanna, still curious, decided to let it go and smiled, \"Okay, thank you, Arix.\"\nDeanna noticed Arix’s attempt to change the subject and went along with it, saying, \"Okay, thank you, Arix.\"\n\"You’re welcome,\" Arix replied with a smile. She walked Deanna to her dormitory and, worried that Deanna might be bullied because of her background on Planet Void, she stayed for a while longer.\nAfter arranging to attend the class together in the afternoon, Arix finally felt at ease and headed back to her dorm.\nHowever, Arix didn’t know that as soon as she left, the sweet and gentle Deanna turned fierce. She swiftly dealt with her roommates who were looking for trouble, knocking them down one by one.\n\"Don’t mess with me again, or it wouldn’t be surprising if one or two classmates went missing outside school someday,\" Deanna said coldly, looking at the two girls she had under her foot.\n\"S-sorry, we know we were wrong,\" the two girls, no longer arrogant, apologized timidly.\nOnly then did Deanna let out a satisfied huff. She released them and continued tidying up her room.\nThe private dorm assigned to Arix sat conveniently close to the girls’ dormitory in the central staff area, just a short walk away. With the address on her opticomputer, Arix easily found her new home for the next four years.\nHer dorm number was 30, a charming two-story building. Arix took in the exterior before approaching the front door.\nBefore she could do anything, the AI butler greeted her.\n\"Welcome home, master.\"\nThe front gate swung open automatically. Arix, caught off guard, stepped inside. Her curiosity peaked as she looked around. The house had a delicate country style, surrounded by lush green trees, offering a peaceful retreat from campus life.\nArix marveled at the luxurious garden. If this were her own home, the opulence wouldn’t be surprising. But for a school dormitory, it seemed extravagant.\nThis high-end treatment made Arix suspicious. It felt like HMA had some hidden agenda.\nAfter pondering for a bit and coming up empty, Arix shrugged it off, thinking,\n’Whatever comes, I’ll handle it.’\nAfter all, what could a military academy really be plotting?\nWith these thoughts, she started admiring the garden as she headed to the porch. Before she could use her opticomputer to unlock the door, it opened on its own.\nPuzzled, Arix saw a robot butler bowing respectfully inside, saying, \"Welcome, master.\"\nThe robot butler, about half a meter tall and resembling a small astronaut with its robotic joints, greeted her.\nSurprised, Arix asked, \"Who are you?\"\n\"Hello, master. I am PO, your campus butler. I will take care of your daily needs for the next four years,\" the robot replied in a cute, respectful voice.",

      "content": "Chapter 169: Tense Study\nArix, intrigued by the waist-high robot, crouched down to inspect it closely.\n’A talking, moving robot!’\nShe felt the urge to take it apart.\n\"Master, damaging public property will get your punished,\" PO said, his big eyes blinking innocently on its screen-like face, as if reading Arix’s mind.\n\"It’s okay, I have money,\" Arix said, her fingers itching to dismantle it. But before she could proceed, PO’s cute voice chimed in again.\n\"Besides compensation, you may also fail to pass personal assessment,\" PO warned kindly.\nArix paused.\n’Great, now I’m being threatened by a robot.’\nArix took a deep breath and forced a smile, saying, \"I was just joking. You’re so adorable, how could I be so cruel to take you apart?\"\n\"Master, I have a lie detection function and has detected that you are lying,\" PO responded honestly, without any sense of tact.\nArix: ...\n’Is this robot really here to help me?’\nArix rubbed her forehead and sighed, \"PO, turn off the lie detection function.\"\n\"Okay, master. Turning off PO’s lie detection function. Please wait three seconds. 3, 2, 1. PO’s lie detection function is now off. Is there anything else you need, master?\" PO asked sweetly.\n\"Show me around the house and explain the layout,\" Arix said, eager to explore the beautifully decorated house.\n\"Okay, master, please follow me,\" PO said, leading the way. At each spot, PO gave a detailed and charming introduction.\n\"This is the living room. You can hang out with your friends here,\" PO began, standing in place.\nArix nodded, following PO and listening to its detailed, endearing explanations.\n\"This is the bedroom. You can adjust the bedroom environment here. There are currently 574 options to choose from,\" PO said, pointing to a small screen on the wall.\nArix curiously tapped a button for a light rain mode. The bedroom transformed into a bamboo forest with the gentle sound of rain falling.\nAfter trying out a few more options, Arix lost interest. She then followed PO to the study, kitchen, bathroom, potion room, and training center.\nSeeing such a well-equipped house made Arix feel uneasy. It felt like a setup, offering something so nice before trapping her.\nArix suddenly looked at PO and asked, \"Does the school assign a campus butler to every student?\"\n\"No, currently only you, master,\" PO answered honestly.\n\"Who sent you?\" Arix asked again.\n\"An extraordinary talent with ambitions as vast as the universe, knowledgeable in astronomy and geography, capable of ruling the world with a pen and conquering it with a sword, a combination of beauty and wisdom, the embodiment of heroism and chivalry, admired by all - the HMA president,\" PO said, finally getting to the important point after a bunch of flattering nonsense.\nArix rubbed her forehead. Then she said to PO, \"That’s all. You can go now.\"\nAfter checking her schedule, Arix was pleasantly surprised. Not a single class conflict among her five departments today.\nShe raised an eyebrow, thought for a moment, and decided to attend classes in all five departments. It wasn’t out of diligence, but rather curiosity—she wanted to see if in-person classes were better than online ones.\nThe main motivator was the Psychic Ware Department. The classes were tough. A month of online lectures left her feeling lost.\nToday’s class was hands-on, and she hoped that practical experience would make a difference.\nWith her mind made up, Arix checked the time on her opticomputer. Two hours before her first command class—just enough time to tidy up her place before heading out.\nUsing her psychic abilities, Arix scanned every corner of her home for surveillance devices.\nOnce she was sure it was clear, she felt safe to summon Cupid and the others from the psychic world.\n\"Arix, you’re at school!\" Cupid exclaimed excitedly, flying into her arms and snuggling close.\nArix hummed in response, gently patting Cupid.\nSmiling at the other two, Vita and Sophia, she said, \"This is home for the next four years. Any ideas on how to decorate?\"\nCupid looked around the bedroom and pointed at the large windowsill. \"Arix, I want to make a nest there so I can sleep and watch the moon at night.\"\n\"Alright. Vita, Sophia, want nests there too?\" Arix asked.\n\"Sure,\" Vita nodded.\n\"Whatever,\" Sophia replied, indifferent.\nSeeing no objections, Arix decided the large windowsill would be a sleeping area for the three of them. She bought the most comfortable pet nests she could find on the interstellarnet and set them up there.\nWith the bedroom sorted, Arix took Cupid and the others to organize the alchemy room, the training center, and more.\nPO even came by to help. Concerned PO might reveal their presence, Arix activated confidentiality mode in his system to keep the house’s secrets safe.\nOnce everything was in place, Arix checked her opticomputer again. The two hours were almost up.\n\"Cupid, Vita, Sophia, want to stay here or come to class with me?\" she asked as she got ready to leave.\n\"Go with you,\" they replied in unison, turning into streams of psychic power and retreating back into Arix’s psychic world.\nAmused by their clinginess, Arix shook her head with a smile. She left the house and headed towards the Department of Strategy and Commanding building, with PO watching her go, looking a bit sad.\nHMA’s seven departments each had their own six-story building.\nThe Department of Strategy and Commanding’s first floor was a practical room, while the second to fifth floors were designated for freshman to senior classes.\nEach floor was divided into four classes: A, B, C, and D. The top floor housed the teachers’ offices.\nWhen Arix arrived at the Department of Strategy and Commanding A class, Drexel pulled her to sit next to him. She then noticed that Marceau was also there.\nA bit surprised, she greeted him politely, \"Hi, Marceau.\"\nMarceau, who had seemed annoyed because of Drexel, visibly softened when he saw Arix. He nodded back in greeting.\nShortly after their exchange, the teacher arrived. The class followed its usual routine: studying various military strategies and watching historical videos of great leaders commanding battles.\nAfter an hour, the class ended, and Arix said goodbye to Drexel and Marceau before heading to the Class A in the Department of Chemistry building.\nShe had hoped to sit with Calista but found out that Calista didn’t make it into Class A and was placed in Class B instead.\nWith no other choice, Arix found an empty seat and waited for the class to begin.\nThis Chemistry class involved the practical task of making a Star-Class potion. Most students needed the entire class to complete it, but Arix finished her potion in less than ten minutes.\nHer astonishing speed drew the admiration of her classmates and the attention of the mentor.\nArix calmly handed her potion to the mentor, who placed it on the detector.\nMoments later, a screen displayed the potion’s quality report.\nSeeing the nearly perfect scores, the Chemistry mentor felt a mix of admiration and a renewed desire to make Arix the department’s first-chair student.\n\"Miss Kering, your talent and skill make you well-deserving of being the Department of Chemistry’s First Chair. Why don’t you reconsider?\" the mentor said with hopeful eyes.\nPreviously, he had extended this offer during online classes, but Arix had always declined.\n\"Sorry, sir. You know my situation, so I can’t be the First Chair,\" Arix replied firmly.\nThough the title of chief sounded prestigious, it was akin to being a sergeant, responsible for many class duties. It wasn’t suitable for Arix, who was involved in several departments.\nFortunately, the mentor was reasonable. He sighed but didn’t push further.\nAfter her Chemistry class, Arix made a quick exit. It wasn’t that she was particularly eager for the Psychic Ware Department class, but the mentor’s wistful gaze had given her chills.\nShe felt like she was being watched as if she were a heartless deserter, despite being a pure and innocent young woman.\nWhile chemistry was almost natural for Arix, like drinking water, the Psychic Ware Department class was her nightmare. She held an Insectoid Core in one hand and a carving knife in the other, unsure where to start despite her prolonged efforts.\nPsychic Ware was designed to nourish and upgrade psychic power, as well as heal the psychic world. This was different from Arix’s Psychic Healer, which required sacrificing a core each time and couldn’t enhance psychic power.\nThe Psychic Ware created from Insectoid Cores could be used almost indefinitely unless physically damaged.\nThe process of creating Psychic Ware was similar to crafting formation plates in the magic world; the difference was that one used magical power to carve the formation plates, while the other used psychic power to carve the Insectoid Core. Both methods shared a common challenge: they had to be completed in one go. If interrupted, the Insectoid Core would be ruined.",

      "content": "Chapter 170: A Giant Failure\nMaking Psychic Ware was a real challenge.\nFirst off, Arix had to get rid of the angry psychic power from the core. That part was a breeze for her. The tricky part was carving the patterns on the Insectoid Core, following the textbook diagrams.\nThen came arranging the patterns into a formation that would keep flowing endlessly. The higher the level of Psychic Ware, the more complex the patterns and diagrams.\nArix remembered her mentor mentioning this in an online class. The highest level, Supergiant-Class Psychic Ware, had tens of thousands of patterns and dozens of diagrams. In comparison, the level-one Psychic Ware Arix was working on only had about ten patterns.\nBut for Arix, who was new to making Psychic Ware, it felt like a chef used to cooking tropical food suddenly having to master Iceland cuisine.\nIn short, it was incredibly frustrating.\n\"Arix, don’t rush. Take your time,\" said Talyra, a genius who had already finished carving her level-one Psychic Ware. She offered Arix a gentle word of comfort.\n\"Mm, thank you, Talyra,\" Arix replied gratefully. She glanced enviously at the Psychic Ware Talyra had made, then took a deep breath. She picked up the carving knife and started working on the Insectoid Core again.\nThe beginning went smoothly, the middle was okay, but when it came time to form the diagram, the core exploded.\nLuckily, Arix’s psychic power was strong. She quickly wrapped the core with her power to prevent any harm.\nEven though no one got hurt, the loud explosion made everyone around jumpy. After it happened a few times, her classmates started avoiding her like she was bad luck.\nThe terrifying noise repeated ten times. Eventually, even the mentor couldn’t ignore it. The mentor came to Arix’s side to see what was going wrong.\nAfter watching for a while, even the mentor was puzzled. Arix’s technique was correct, even better than the other students’, but she still couldn’t form the diagram on the core.\nThe mentor started to worry. If he couldn’t figure out the student’s problem, it would be very embarrassing.\nNervously, he swallowed and then had an idea.\nHe opened his opticomputer and secretly recorded Arix’s process of making Psychic Ware. He sent the video to his own teacher.\nFar away in Mulado, a Psychic Ware master was leisurely drinking tea with a friend when his opticomputer suddenly beeped.\n\"Master, your foolish apprentice has sent another message,\" said the computer.\nBryndel paused his tea-drinking and, looking apologetic, said to his friend, \"Tarian, I’m sorry, please wait a moment.\"\n\"Take your time. Go ahead and take care of your business,\" Tarian said with a smile, though his ears perked up with curiosity.\nBryndel nodded slightly and opened his opticomputer to check the message from his apprentice.\n\"Sir, help me! I need to figure out what is wrong with this student.\"\nBryndel frowned and then played the video below the message.\nIn the video, Arix was carefully carving the Insectoid Core with such focus that it was clear she was a diligent student. Bryndel, who appreciated hardworking youngsters, nodded in approval.\nBut in the next moment, his smile vanished.\nIn the video, every time Arix carved an Insectoid Core, it exploded.\nShe would carve one, it would explode, and then she would carve another, which would also explode.\nBryndel’s face twitched, and he rubbed his forehead in frustration.\nHis apprentice was right; this girl was indeed \"cursed.\"\n\"Bryndel, what’s going on? Do you need my help?\" Tarian, hearing the repeated explosions from the screen, was as curious as a cat.\nNot wanting to refuse his friend, Bryndel shared the screen with Tarian.\n\"Please take a look,\" Bryndel said with a wry smile.\nTarian, eager to see, looked at the screen and saw it was just a young girl carving cores. Although initially disappointed, he continued to watch patiently.\nThen he saw the scene of Arix carving one core after another, each one exploding.\n\"Hahaha,\" Tarian laughed heartily at Arix’s bewildered expression. He joked, \"I think this girl shouldn’t waste her time in the Psychic Ware Department. She should go for weapon research instead. She’s a natural demolition expert.\"\nBryndel nodded, agreeing with the amusing thought. Just as he was about to tell his apprentice, he received another message, as if his apprentice had anticipated his thoughts.\n\"Sir, this is Arix, the one who developed the psychic power healing potion. She can’t be transferred.\"\nBryndel was speechless.\n\"Tarian, I’m afraid we can’t transfer her. This girl is Arix from the Kering family, the one who created the psychic power healing potion,\" Bryndel said, swallowing nervously.\nSince the introduction of the psychic power healing potion, many big shots in the Psychic Ware community had been envious. If he decided to transfer Arix, not only would his teacher disown him, but he would also lose his place in the Psychic Ware world. Many old masters were eagerly waiting for Arix to invent more powerful Psychic Ware, just like she did with the healing potion.\nTarian, also a master in the Psychic Ware field, understood the gravity of the situation and could no longer laugh.\nThe key to whether they, the Psychic Ware Masters, could outshine the chemists lay with this young girl.\nWith this in mind, Tarian’s expression turned serious. \"Let’s watch it again. If we can’t figure it out, we should ask a grandmaster for help.\"\nBryndel nodded solemnly and replayed the video of Arix creating Psychic Ware several times.\n\"It seems like Arix’s psychic power clashes with the psychic power of the insectoid, causing the explosions,\" Bryndel said, frowning deeply and sounding uncertain.\n\"That does seem to be the case from the video, which makes it even more problematic. If we had encountered a student like this before, the best advice would be to transfer her to another department. This kind of issue usually means the student is a hopeless case for the Psychic Ware Department,\" Tarian said, starting to feel a headache coming on.\nHe even regretted visiting his friend for tea today. He should have made an excuse and left when his friend started the video call. Now, he was stuck dealing with this issue.\nTeaching a hopeless case to create Psychic Ware was like trying to teach a fish to climb a tree. No matter how talented they were, it would be a wasted effort.\nBryndel got the reasoning too, which only made him more uneasy.\nHe tried to comfort both his friend and himself, saying, \"It is Arix Kering, after all. What else can we do? Let’s give it another shot and hope for a miracle, just like when she invented the psychic power healing potion against all odds.\"\nTarian sighed, nodded quietly, and cautiously suggested, \"Alright, let’s have Arix use a small amount of psychic power and try again.\"\n\"That’s our only option,\" Bryndel agreed reluctantly.\nThey passed on the problems and suggestions to Arix’s mentor.\nMeanwhile, Arix had already destroyed a trash can full of Insectoid Cores, causing her classmates to quietly distance themselves from her.\nArix, holding the last core, frowned and began carving again, this time with even more care. But the outcome was the same. The Insectoid Cores were like stubborn, unyielding beings, refusing to transform into her Psychic Ware.\nAfter ruining the final core, Arix threw it into the trash can in frustration and sighed deeply, finally stopping her work\nThe nearby students also sighed in relief and returned to their seats, carving their own Insectoid Cores seriously. Some began to complain.\n\"We’re getting worn out. I think Arix just doesn’t have the knack for Psychic Ware,\" one person grumbled from a corner of the classroom.\n\"Yeah, that trash can full of ruined cores says it all,\" his desk mate agreed softly.\n\"But isn’t she a potion genius? Why stick with the Psychic Ware Department? Even if she succeeds, it’ll probably be low-quality,\" the first person’s desk mate said, puzzled.\n\"Who knows?\"\nHearing the murmurs around her, Arix’s face darkened. She started to wonder if she really lacked talent for Psychic Ware.\nThe mentor was anxious too, but then his opticomputer buzzed. Opening it, he saw a message from his teacher:\n\"Her psychic power conflicts with the energy of Insectoid Cores. Since she can’t change departments, let her try using a small amount of psychic power.\"\nPsychic Ware Department mentor felt disappointed.\n’The conflict with the Insectoid Core energy essentially doomes her in the Psychic Ware Department.’\nThe mentor fought the urge to scream, wiped his face, and then cleared his throat. He turned to Arix and said, \"Arix, I watched your work, and your technique was correct, but you missed the most crucial point.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 171: Stay Healthy\nArix heard the voice and turned her head in confusion, realizing her mentor was right behind her.\n\"Sir, what did I miss?\" she asked sincerely.\n\"Your psychic power conflicts with the energy of the Insectoid Cores, so your patterns can’t coexist with the cores,\" the mentor explained directly, sounding regretful.\n\"Conflicts?\" Arix thought deeply.\nShe remembered when she was learning to make Star-Class potions. Back then, the psychic power of the Insectoid Cores always avoided her approach, but she had used Cupid’s psychic power.\nJust now, she had used Cupid’s psychic power to carve and reorganize. ’What if I use Vita or Sophia’s power instead?’ she wondered.\nArix’s eyes lit up. She pulled out a bunch of Insectoid Cores from her space button. Without a word, she picked up her carving knife and got to work quickly.\nThe surrounding students groaned, \"She’s starting again!\"\nThe mentor wanted to say more but seeing Arix so focused on carving, he stayed silent and watched.\nAs Arix was about to complete the pattern, forming a diagram, the surrounding students, expecting the usual explosion, sighed and covered their ears.\nBut after a while, there was no explosion.\nThey looked puzzled for a moment, then widened their eyes in disbelief at Arix.\n’Has she actually made a Psychic Ware?’\nThe entire class, including the mentor, stared at Arix’s palm in shock and confusion. There lay an Insectoid Core with a complete diagram—no, it was now a Psychic Ware.\nHowever, Arix didn’t seem to care about this highly anticipated Psychic Ware. She casually tossed it aside and started carving other Insectoid Cores as if addicted.\nGradually, the number of Psychic Wares increased. When Arix made the third one, the mentor’s face stiffened, and his body trembled. He thought she was a failure before, but now her talent seemed terrifying.\nA typical Psychic Ware Master took several days to carve one Psychic Ware, even when fully focused. But Arix? She made one every ten minutes, faster than an assembly line!\nAs the mentor’s mind roared, the bell for the end of class rang. Arix snapped out of her trance. But the next moment, she saw stars. She felt so tired as her energy was completely drained.\nArix’s fingers trembled as she picked up the five newly carved Psychic Wares, a satisfied smile spreading across her face. Then, under the admiring gazes of everyone around her, she completely fainted.\nThe students and the Psychic Ware mentor were stunned for a second before a wave of shouts and the scraping of chairs filled the room.\nA moment later, everyone in the classroom, now fully aware of what had happened, scrambled to carry Arix to the school nurse.\nThe commotion in the Psychic Ware Department quickly caught the attention of the rest of HMA.\nGunder, the president, was in his office handling official duties when he heard that Arix had fainted. He immediately stood up in a panic, rushing towards the medical center while nervously praying, \"Please, nothing must happen to her!\"\nIn the hospital room, Arix lay on the bed, looking pale. Two doctors stood by her, checking her condition.\nOutside, Gunder and Marlone shot icy glares at the mentor from the Psychic Ware Department.\nThe mentor, who had just sent the students away, stood off to the side, looking nervous.\n\"Valtor, explain,\" Gunder said with a smile, but that smile didn’t reach his cold eyes as he stared down the mentor.\nMarlone didn’t say a word, but the fierce look in his eyes was enough.\nValtor swallowed hard and quickly bowed, apologizing. \"President Gunder, this is all my fault. I’m sorry. I was too shocked to stop Arix from continuing to carve the Psychic Ware.\"\nGunder narrowed his eyes. \"If I remember correctly, she is just a freshman. How could she shock you?\" he asked suspiciously.\nMarlone added in a harsh tone, \"Arix had never touched Psychic Ware before. You’ll need a better excuse.\"\nValtor felt wronged but kept silent. He handed over the five pieces of Psychic Ware and showed them a video of Arix making them.\nThis video was originally meant to surprise his teacher. Now, it was proof of his innocence.\n\"You’ll see I’m not lying,\" Valtor said, sharing the video.\nAfter watching the video, Gunder and Marlone exchanged disbelieving looks, finally understanding Valtor’s shock.\nGunder thought for a moment, then addressed Valtor. \"Although you didn’t do it on purpose, your carelessness put her in the medical room. Your salary for this month is cut, and your year-end bonus is halved. These penalties will go to compensate Arix. Do you have any objections?\"\n\"No, no,\" Valtor replied, feeling relieved. His mistake wasn’t severe but significant enough in the military school.\nWith the President’s decision made, Marlone had no objections either, though he still looked unhappy with Valtor.\nValtor felt guilty and tried to blend into the background.\nSeeing this, Marlone snorted and turned his attention to the hospital room, ignoring Valtor.\nThey waited a bit longer until the door opened again.\nThe school nurse stepped out, taking off her gloves, and said, \"She’s fine. She just overused her psychic power. I gave her a bottle of psychic power healing potion, and she’s almost fully recovered.\"\n\"Thank you,\" Gunder and the others said gratefully.\n\"Go in and see her. I have other things to do,\" The nurse nodded slightly and left with her assistant.\nMarlone, and Valtor walked into the room.\nArix was awake, staring sadly at the ceiling. She couldn’t escape it... She had drunk the psychic power healing potion... and only she knew how what it was made from.\nA tear rolled down her cheek, taking with it her sense of personal hygiene.\nWhen Marlone came in, he saw Arix looking pale and weak. He immediately walked over, worried, and asked, \"Arix, how do you feel? Are you okay?\"\n\"I’m fine, just a little tired,\" Arix replied weakly with a forced smile.\n\"That’s good. You scared me badly,\" Marlone said, patting his chest with relief.\nArix looked at Marlone’s strong, bear-like build and smiled without saying anything.\nAfter the three took turns expressing their concern, they prepared to leave.\nBefore leaving, Gunder took out the five pieces of Psychic Ware and handed them to Arix. His voice was full of pride but also a bit of reproach. \"Arix, you are the most talented and hardworking student I have ever seen, so please stay safe. Take care of yourself next time, understand?\"\n\"Thank you, President Gunder. I understand,\" Arix nodded obediently.\n\"Rest well. We’ll be going now,\" Gunder said, and the three left the room together.\n\"Thank you for the visit,\" Arix half-lay in bed, waving at them.\nAfter watching them leave, Arix looked down at the Psychic Ware in her hand. She had carved these using Sophia’s psychic power. However, she hadn’t tried using Vita’s psychic power yet.\nArix took out her carving knife, but then she remembered the President’s words. After hesitating for a moment, she put the knife away.\n’Never mind, I’ll try it later,’\nshe thought, lying back down to rest.\nThere were mecha and soldier classes in the afternoon, so she needed to rest well now.\nWhile Arix’s hospital room remained calm, the outside world was in an uproar.\nEspecially in the Psychic Ware community, where the big shots were almost fighting for the chance to teach at HMA.\nAt the Mulado Psychic Ware Master Association, after watching the video of Arix creating Psychic Ware, almost all the Grandmasters wanted to take her as an apprentice.\nKnowing that Arix was also the one who invented the psychic power healing potion, they were completely amazed.\nArix’s talent, strength, and background aside, her incredible innovation ability alone was enough to make them eager.\nGod knows what more powerful inventions she might create in the future. Being her teacher would be a great honor.\nThe more the Psychic Ware Grandmasters thought about it, the more excited they became. They all gathered in the association’s office, arguing like old men and women at a marketplace.\n\"Thrynn, how long has it been since you last carved a level-three Psychic Ware? And you still have the nerve to compete for an apprentice?\" shouted an elderly man with white hair and a beard, his face red with anger.\n\"That’s still better than you, the playboy teacher. How many apprentices have you taken on? Can you even teach them all?\" Thrynn retorted with a snort.\n\"Stop arguing, everyone. I’m the most talented here, so I’m the best fit to be Arix’s master,\" Bryndel chimed in, joining the heated discussion.\n\"Bah, you’re the least qualified one!\" the white-haired old man and Thrynn turned to him simultaneously, shouting in unison.",

How can you have the nerve to take on new apprentices?\"\nBryndel looked down, mumbling softly, \"He’s just a young man pursuing his dreams. How can I stop him?\"\n\"Don’t just bring up the first apprentice,\" Thrynn cut in, clearly unhappy. \"What about the second one, Xinghe? A talented Psychic Ware genius who ran off with the Empire’s merman right after finishing his training.\"\nBryndel’s head drooped lower, but he kept muttering, \"He left behind fame and money for live. Isn’t that romantic?\"\n\"And then there’s the third apprentice,\" chimed in an elder from the Psychic Ware Association. \"This one’s the best. Founded a new Psychic Ware Association and thinks we’re just a bunch of old fossils who can’t adapt.\"\nBryndel swallowed hard, too scared to speak. The third apprentice was truly a thorn in his side, having done everything possible to betray him.\nSeeing his silence, the others nodded in approval and continued to berate him.\nAfter a long, fruitless argument, everyone turned their eyes to the president of the Psychic Ware Association, seated at the head of the table.\n\"President, you decide who is most qualified to teach Arix,\" Seldner said, casting a provocative glance at Thrynn.\nBoth of them were the strongest and had the best chance.\nThrynn, not wanting to back down, glared back and then fixed his gaze on the president too.\nThe president looked around, lowered his eyelashes, and said, \"Then Bryndel it is.\"\nEveryone was shocked.\nBryndel raised his head in disbelief, pointing at himself. \"Sir, you are you sure? Aren’t you afraid I’ll train another troublemaker?\"\nHe had only trained three apprentices, two went rogue, and one was on the verge of it.\nThinking about his three troublesome apprentices, Bryndel suddenly lost the desire to take on new ones. One apprentice shouting \"Destroy the old, build the new\" was already more than enough trouble. If he trained another, his life would be over.\n\"If you train another troublemaker, you don’t want to know the consequences,\" the president said coldly, his gaze icy.\nBryndel stayed silent. He knew the president wasn’t joking. Messing up with Arix would mean consequences far worse than losing his life.\nSeldner and Thrynn stopped arguing and tried to persuade the president. \"Sir, this is too reckless,\" they said, their expressions showing just how unreliable they thought Bryndel was.\nSeeing their disagreement, the president explained calmly, \"The research of the Psychic Ware has hit a dead end. We don’t need geniuses; we need mavericks. And when it comes to nurturing mavericks, no one can compare to Bryndel.\"\nThrynn and Seldner were stunned and finally sat back down, saying nothing more.\nWith their silence, Bryndel became unhappy instead. \"Sir, I don’t think I can take the job. I’m really not suited for teaching an apprentice. Let someone else do it,\" he said, trembling with fear but still trying to resist.\nThe president just glanced at him and said, \"When you finish paying the fines for your apprentices, then you can have a say here.\"\nBryndel choked on his words.\n’ Those troublemakers!’\nHe sighed deeply and closed his eyes in resignation.\nThe other elders, seeing this, were no longer angry. Instead, they seemed amused and explained to some newcomers the origin of Bryndel’s fines.\nBryndel’s apprentices, Lorin and Jorvik, were top talents in the Psychic Ware field.\nUnfortunately, Lorin felt that staying in the Alliance was limiting his perspective of the world, so he joined the space pirates. Jorvik, on the other hand, was obsessed with love and ran off with a mermaid spy from the Empire, taking the Alliance’s Psychic Ware technology with him, which led to the Alliance’s secrets being leaked.\nUnable to find the culprits, the Alliance blamed their master, Bryndel.\nAs a result, poor Bryndel was saddled with a huge debt, and if he didn’t repay it, he’d end up in prison for life.\nThough his apprentices caused a mess, Bryndel’s own skills in the Psychic Ware field were undeniable. So, out of appreciation for his talent, the Psychic Ware Association helped pay off his fines. But the condition was that Bryndel would spend the rest of his life working for them.\nIt was unfair, but since these apprentices were taught by him, he had to bear the responsibility for their actions.\nAnd so, the choice of Arix’s future teacher was peacefully decided.\nAside from Bryndel feeling a bit miserable, the other leaders were quite satisfied.\nAfter the meeting ended, they even patted Bryndel on the shoulder and encouraged him. \"Hang in there. The future of the Psychic Ware Department is in your hands. We believe in you.\"\nAs Seldner left, he lifted his chin proudly and said, \"If Arix has any questions you can’t figure out for her, you can send her to me.\"\nWith that, he huffed and walked away, full of himself.\nThrynn felt a pang of regret. He had high hopes for Arix as an apprentice, but he trusted the president’s decision. He looked at Bryndel, sighed, and left with a worried expression.\nBryndel rolled his eyes, feeling exasperated. He opened his opticomputer to review the information the president had sent him about his new apprentice.\nHe just hoped this fourth one would be obedient. He couldn’t handle much more trouble at his age.\nAt Hecaris Military Academy, in the clinic...\nArix woke up and noticed someone sent her a friend request on her opticomputer. She glanced at the request but dismissed it right away.\n\"I’m your future Psychic Ware mentor, Bryndel. Come on, let’s conquer the world together.\"\nShe knew she didn’t have a mentor by that name, so she figured it was just another scam.\nWith a shrug, Arix got up and tidied up the clinic. It was time to leave. She thanked the school nurse and headed towards the mecha department building.\nArix’s arrival went mostly unnoticed here. For the students in the mecha department, idols were fleeting; only mechas were their true passion.\nRelieved by the focused atmosphere, Arix picked a seat and sat down quietly, waiting for class to start.\nWhen the bell rang, the mentor of the mecha department walked in. But he didn’t start the lesson immediately. Instead, he smiled at the students and announced, \"Class, you’re in for a treat. The mecha Grandmaster of the Fifth Legion is here to give a lesson today. Please give him a warm welcome.\"\nThe students cheered, and the applause was deafening.\nArix’s eyes lit up with excitement, and she clapped enthusiastically. She was glad she came today; she wouldn’t have wanted to miss a Grandmaster’s class.\nThe students were buzzing, all eyes on the door, eagerly awaiting the Grandmaster’s arrival.\nFinally, under the eager gazes of the students, an old man slowly walked into the classroom. He stood behind the lectern, smiling warmly, and introduced himself, \"Hello, everyone. I am Magen, the mecha Grandmaster of the Fifth Legion. Today, I’m here to answer your questions about mechas. Feel free to ask anything.\"\nAs Magen spoke, he scanned the students but didn’t see the one he was looking for. He frowned slightly, puzzled as to why Arix wasn’t there. She loved mechas and wouldn’t miss this class.\nMagen had come specifically to see his future apprentice. Missing her would make this trip pointless.\nArix didn’t recognize Magen either. He wasn’t in his usual work clothes. Instead, he looked like a dignified gentleman at a party. One was an old janitor; the other, a distinguished Psychic Ware Grandmaster. It was hard to connect the two.\nMagen also didn’t recognize Arix, who now looked like a little fairy compared to the scrappy girl from a month ago.\nSo, the two missed recognizing each other, totally unaware of each other’s presence.",

      "content": "Chapter 173: Grandmaster\n\"Sir, is there really such a thing as a level-eight mecha?\" one student eagerly asked.\nMagen sighed, realizing he could only look for Arix after class. He then began to seriously answer the student’s question. \"Yes, there are, and each of the five legions has one,\" Magen said calmly.\n\"Sir, I heard that only the heirs of the five major families can pilot the level-eight mechas. Why is that? Do ordinary people have no chance?\" another student asked.\n\"This question involves the secrets of the five families, and I can’t say much. But these five level-eight mechas were obtained at a great cost by the ancestors of the five families. So, it’s not that only the noble families’ people can pilot them, but rather the level-eight mechas only recognize their direct bloodline. Anyone else who tries to pilot them will suffer,\" Magen explained, sighing again.\nAlthough Magen wasn’t from a noble family, as a mecha Grandmaster, he understood many unspoken truths.\n\"I see.\" The student who asked didn’t fully understand but got the gist.\n\"Sir, if we have level-eight mechas, why have we never seen them on the battlefield?\" another student asked, puzzled.\n\"Because the insectoids are unbeatable. The level-eight mechas are mainly for deterrence. If they ever appear on the battlefield, it means the whole universe is in crisis. So, you should be glad the level-eight mechas haven’t been deployed yet,\" Magen revealed, not minding sharing some secrets early.\nMilitary students had the right to know some things from the moment they entered the academy.\n\"Sir, why are the insectoids unbeatable? They are strong, but not invincible, right?\" one student protested.\nMagen just smiled slightly and didn’t argue. He didn’t explain the reason either, simply saying, \"Maybe you’ll find out when you join the Legion.\"\nThe questioning student was speechless, feeling like a parent had told him \"you’ll understand when you grow up.\nThe other students didn’t care about his feelings and continued to ask their own questions.\nMagen patiently answered all the students’ varied questions, benefiting even those who hadn’t asked.\nArix also asked a few questions about mecha materials. After hearing Magen’s answers, she felt enlightened and planned to experiment that night.\nSoon, the class bell rang, and Magen left the classroom with the mecha department mentor.\n\"Excuse me, do you have a student named Arix in your class?\" Magen quickly asked the question he had held back the entire class.\nTovan was stunned by the question, staring at Magen for a moment before saying, \"Yes, Arix was here. Didn’t you talk to her?\"\n\"Hmm? Did I?\" Magen was also taken aback. He was sure he hadn’t seen that little girl.\n\"She was sitting in the last row, that one, see?\" Tovan reminded.\nMagen thought back suspiciously. There had been a girl in the last row, her striking appearance catching his eye. But her face looked completely different from the thin, cute Arix he remembered.\n\"Are you sure? I’m looking for Arix, the daughter of the Kering family,\" Magen still doubted.\nTovan nodded firmly, \"Yes, that’s her.\"\nMagen was speechless for a moment before hesitantly asking, \"Did she get plastic surgery recently?\"\n\"No, sir,\" Tovan laughed. Then he explained the reason to Magen in detail.\nAfter figuring out the situation, Magen coughed awkwardly. Then he instructed Tovan, \"Can you ask Arix to come to the office? I need to talk to her.\"\n\"Sure thing, sir.\" Tovan agreed without asking questions. Inside, he felt a bit envious of Arix.=\n’A private meeting with the Grandmaster? That meant she has impressed him. Maybe, if she’s lucky, she can even become his apprentice,’\nThe more he thought about it, the more jealous he became.\nMeanwhile, Arix had just left the classroom when she received a message from Tovan. Without much thought, she headed straight to the office. After a polite knock, she heard an old man’s voice from inside.\n\"Come in.\"\nArix’s eyes widened in surprise, as she recognized that voice belonged to the Grandmaster. Nervously swallowing, she opened the door and saw the old man at the desk. It was indeed him.\nWith her suspicions confirmed, Arix approached without hesitation and bowed slightly. \"Hello, sir.\"\nMagen looked at Arix and seemed to see someone else in her. He smiled slightly and said, \"Call me Mr. Magen. I went to school with your grandparents.\"\nA bit puzzled, Arix sweetly responded, \"Mr. Magen.\"\nMagen’s face showed a hint of relief. He smiled and pointed to the chair in front of him. \"Sit down. Don’t be nervous Treat me like your grandfather.\"\nFeeling a bit overwhelmed, Arix nodded and sat down as instructed.\n\"Mr. Magen, why did you call me here?\" Arix asked, still confused.\nNot seeing Tovan in the office, she knew it had to be Magen who asked her to come.\nMagen didn’t waste any time and got straight to the point. \"Do you want to study mechas?\"\nHearing this, Arix’s eyelashes fluttered. She looked at Magen in surprise. But quickly, she lowered her gaze and said firmly, \"Yes! I’ve always wanted to.\"\n\"Good. If you’re willing, starting today, I will be your mentor. I’ll teach you everything I know. Arix, do I have that honor?\" Magen looked at the young woman before him with a warmth that was almost familial.\nArix tried to contain her excitement and asked, stammering slightly, \"Why... are you... being so kind to me?\"\nFrom the moment she entered the room, Arix felt that Magen’s kindness was genuine. It wasn’t the kind of flattery meant to impress, but a sincere desire to help her.\nMagen looked at the excited yet cautious young girl, his smile deepening. He realized if he didn’t explain, she might remain uneasy for a long time.\n\"Think of it as repaying a favor. Your grandfather once saved my life. But wanting to take you as my apprentice is because of you, not him,\" Magen said kindly, though with a touch of pride.\nHearing this, Arix felt relieved. She immediately performed the formal apprenticeship ceremony with utmost respect.\n\"Thank you for taking me as your apprentice, sir. I swear I’ll try my best and never let you down,\" Arix said solemnly.\nMagen stood up and gently helped Arix rise. He nodded seriously under her expectant gaze, saying, \"Good. I’m sure you’ll do a great job.\"\nAfter the ceremony, Magen, who needed to return to the Fifth Legion, exchanged opticomputer contacts with Arix. He left her a bunch of mecha materials and a thick notebook before hurrying off with the soldiers who came to pick him up.\n\"Arix, leave me a message if you have any questions. I’ll reply as soon as I can,\" Magen reminded her as the spaceship doors closed.\n\"Got it, Mr. Magen. Don’t worry,\" Arix replied. She wanted to call him \"sir\" but remembered he preferred \"Mr. Magen,\" so she quickly adjusted.\nMagen smiled contentedly and turned to follow an officer. As Arix waved goodbye, she felt an odd sense of familiarity with Mr. Magen.\nWatching the spaceship leave, Arix suddenly remembered the old man in the Mecha Department. Realizing who Magen was, she smiled.\nAfter the spaceship was out of sight, Arix turned to head back to her dormitory when her opticomputer chimed.\n\"Master, you have a friend request.\"\nArix opened the message without much thought and saw the note accompanying the request:\n\"I really am your Psychic Ware mentor! (crying emoji)\"\nSeeing the frustration in the message, Arix hesitated before rejecting the request.\n’Could this person really be who he claims?’\nThinking of the name Bryndel mentioned earlier, Arix pondered for a moment and sent a video request to Cirilla.\nCirilla quickly answered the call, her voice curious. \"Arix, what’s up?\"\n\"Cirilla, do you know a Psychic Ware Master named Bryndel?\" Arix asked, aware that Cirilla’s family had a long history with Psychic Ware. If such a master existed, she would know.\nHearing the name, Cirilla shivered and asked in shock, \"He’s my grandpa’s brother. Arix, why are you asking about him?\"\nNot knowing how to explain, Arix simply shared her screen, showing the friend request to Cirilla.\nCirilla’s mouth twitched when she saw that Bryndel wanted to take Arix as an apprentice. She looked like she’d seen a demon and quickly said, \"Reject him! Reject! Arix, listen to me. Do not agree.\"\nArix looked puzzled and asked, \"Cirilla, what’s wrong with him?\"\n\"He himself is fine, but all his apprentices have issues,\" Cirilla started venting as soon as she began talking about him.\nWorried that her friend might fall into a trap, Cirilla explained the stories of Bryndel and his three villainous apprentices.\nAfter hearing about Lorin and Jorvik, Arix felt like she should feel sad for Bryndel, but for some reason, she just wanted to laugh. She coughed awkwardly and curiously asked, \"What about the third apprentice?\"\n\"The third apprentice is called Talrin. He’s not a bad person,\" Cirilla said, her expression becoming complicated.",

      "content": "Chapter 174: Studying Mecha\nTalrin was Bryndel’s third apprentice. Bryndel had two apprentices before, but they didn’t turn out great. So, Bryndel decided to keep a close watch on Talrin. Every day, he reminded Talrin to think about the good of the Alliance and told him to love the country.\nSoon enough, Talrin became very patriotic, just like Bryndel wanted. But this new outlook made him dislike the Psychic Ware Association. He thought their cramming way of teaching was stifling the kids’ talents. So, Talrin started a new Psychic Ware Association. It was small, but the original Association felt insulted by it. The two groups became like enemies.\nAfter Cirilla finished telling Bryndel’s story, Arix didn’t seem scared. Instead, she looked more interested and said, \"Actually, that’s quite interesting.\"\nCirilla felt her warnings were backfiring, making Arix more curious. She wanted to shake some sense into Arix but knew she couldn’t interfere too much. She sighed and said, \"Arix, from my point of view, becoming Bryndel’s apprentice is a big trap. Do you get what I mean?\"\nCirilla looked at Arix nervously, waiting for her answer.\nArix didn’t reply right away. Instead, she suddenly asked, \"Is Bryndel good at making Psychic Ware?\"\nCirilla was puzzled by the question but answered honestly, \"Bryndel is a Grandmaster. If he wasn’t good enough, he’d have locked up long ago for having two and a half bad apprentices.\"\n\"That’s good then. Cirilla, I’ve decided. I want to be his apprentice.\" Arix looked even more excited after hearing that Bryndel was a Grandmaster.\nCirilla almost yelled out, \"Arix, this is really a big trap. Maybe you should think about it some more?\" She still tried to persuade her friend.\n\"Arix, if someone had told you before fighting the insectoid queen that it was a hopeless trap and you shouldn’t go, would you listen?\" Arix asked with a smile.\n\"No!\" Cirilla replied instantly. She knew she wouldn’t know if she could beat the insectoid queen without trying.\nArix laughed softly and said, \"So, Cirilla, let me try. Even if it’s a trap, I need to fall into it to know if it really hurts.\"\nCirilla couldn’t understand why Arix wanted to take such a risk, but she was impressed. She sighed and said, \"Okay, if Bryndel tricks you, contact me. I know someone who can deal with him.\"\n\"Thanks, Cirilla. Let’s end it here for today. Goodbye,\" Arix said with a smile.\nAfter ending the video call, Arix saw Bryndel’s friend request. She accepted it without much hesitation.\nBryndel: Hello, Arix. The Psychic Ware Master Association forced me into this. I hope you don’t mind.\nAs soon as Arix accepted the friend request, Bryndel eagerly sent a message. He was careful with his words, fearing Arix might reject him if she knew about his three previous apprentices.\nArix hadn’t met Bryndel, so she didn’t know much about him. But from how he treated his apprentices, she could tell he would be a good teacher.\nHe didn’t kick his apprentices out or disown them when they made mistakes. Instead, he even took the fall for them. Just for that, Arix felt lucky to be his apprentice.\nThinking this, Arix smiled and typed a serious message back.\nArix: Hello, sir. Your words make me feel very honored. I should be thanking you for taking me as your apprentice. I have heard about what has happened to your previous apprentices, but without knowing the details, I won’t ever judge. No matter what, I believe you are a great and reliable teacher.\nArix’s sincere words made Bryndel feel deeply touched, and his eyes filled with tears. He thought to himself,\n’This girl does not seem like a troublemaker at all; she must be a sweet and considerate person!’\nWith such a good start to their conversation, Bryndel relaxed and asked Arix some questions about her knowledge of Psychic Ware. Once he understood her learning progress, Bryndel sent Arix a lot of books and notes.\n\"Arix, study these first. If you have any questions, contact me.\" Bryndel instructed carefully. He then said a quick goodbye to his new apprentice, as he had to continue working on Psychic Ware to repay his \"debts.\"\nArix smiled and said goodbye to Bryndel. She then started going through the materials and notes he sent. When she came across the notes of the three previous apprentices, she paused for a moment and decided to open the notes of the third apprentice, Talrin, first.\nThe first sentence she saw made her eyes widen in disbelief.\n\"Could there be a connection between Psychic Incarnation and Psychic Ware? Can ordinary people have their own Psychic Incarnation? What forms can Psychic Incarnation take?\"\nArix felt like a hungry scholar. She eagerly read through the notes of this person she had never met.\nShe wasn’t in a hurry to go back to her dorm. Instead, she found a random place to sit and read the astonishing notes.\nShe lost track of time and even missed her afternoon soldier training class.\nMarlone thought Arix was still feeling unwell and quickly approved her leave, asking her a few concerned questions.\nArix replied absentmindedly for the first time, then she informed Deanna before continuing to read the notes with intense focus.\nAs dusk approached, Arix finally finished reading the notes. She closed her opticomputer and looked up at the dazzling sunset. Her eyes were empty, clearly deep in thought, and she didn’t notice the beautiful sky.\nThe notes of Talrin gave her a lot to process. They were wild and full of crazy ideas, and anyone who read them would get hooked. Arix loved the imaginative thinking in the notes and admired how the guy had pursued such a wild goal for 20 years.\n’But can ordinary people really have their own Psychic Incarnation?’\nArix pondered this for a long time but couldn’t figure it out. She decided to stop thinking about it, knowing that if she kept going, she’d end up spending the night outside.\nArix stood up and brushed off her cold seat. Then she headed back to her dorm, her mind still buzzing with possibilities.\nWhen Arix got home, she was surprised to see that PO had already made dinner. The table was packed with delicious dishes, and Arix couldn’t help but ask, \"PO, where did you get the money for these ingredients?\"\nShe was pretty sure she hadn’t connected PO to her bank account yet,\n’so how could he afford this?’\nPO, in his cute robotic voice, blinked and opened a small storage box in his stomach, showing a few energy stones. \"I get three energy stones as salary each month. I only used two stones and saved one. Today is the first time I met you, so PO wanted to make dinner for the you.\"\nEven though PO’s voice was robotic and emotionless, Arix felt touched. She knelt down and hugged the little robot, which stood just half a meter tall.\n\"Thank you, PO,\" she said, patting his head. \"I have something for you too.\"\nArix then pulled out hundreds of level-three energy stones from her Space Button and filled PO’s storage box to the brim.\n\"Master, this is too much,\" PO said, looking at the overflowing stones in confusion. These were enough for ten years of his salary.\nNot knowing what to do, PO started overheating, with smoke coming out of his head. Arix quickly patted his head, and thankfully, he returned to normal.\n\"Don’t worry, I have plenty of money,\" Arix reassured. She linked her bank account to PO and showed him her balance, revealing an eight-digit figure.\nPO’s screen mouth formed an \"O\" shape. \"Master, you’re so rich!\"\nArix smiled and patted PO. \"I’ve given you payment permissions. Besides living expenses, you can buy whatever you want.\"\n\"Thank you, master. Please eat your meal before it gets cold,\" PO said cheerfully, with fireworks displaying on his screen. He quickly served her a bowl of food.\n\"Thanks, PO.\" Arix sat down to eat, but her opticomputer beeped with a visitor notification.\nChecking the door monitor, she saw Drexel. She opened the gate remotely and granted him house access.",

      "content": "Chapter 175: Kill Stealing\nWhen Drexel walked into the living room, he immediately noticed PO and couldn’t hide his envy. \"Wow, HMA is really spoiling you! It’s one thing for you to have a house, but now you even have a personal butler? This is just going to make me upset,\" Drexel exclaimed.\n\"You can buy a butler yourself. The school doesn’t forbid it,\" Arix said, looking at Drexel with some disdain.\n\"But buying a butler robot costs a lot, especially one that can cook. It costs millions of astrocredits,\" Drexel said as he sat at the table. Acting like a big shot, he then told PO, \"Butler, serve me a bowl of rice!\"\nPO ignored him and looked at Arix instead.\nSeeing this, Drexel laughed angrily and said in a teasing tone, \"A robot with such a stubborn attitude, aren’t you afraid someone might take him apart one day?\"\n\"Drexel Kering, threatening the campus butler; video evidence confirmed; one point deducted from your credits,\" PO’s voice suddenly turned serious and cold.\n\"Hahaha, Arix, look, even robots joke these days,\" Drexel laughed, not believing it.\n\"Ding! Drexel, you have lost one credit,\" the opticomputer announced.\nThe smile on Drexel’s face froze. He looked at the opticomputer screen in disbelief and then stiffly turned to look at PO. It took him a while to accept the reality.\nArix didn’t expect PO to have this function and burst out laughing.\n\"I’ve heard campus butlers rank just below teachers. Seems it’s true,\" Drexel said, feeling a bit heartbroken over his lost credit.\n\"PO, please serve my brother a bowl of rice too,\" Arix said, feeling sorry for him.\n\"Yes, master,\" PO’s voice returned to its sweet tone, and he quickly served Drexel a bowl of rice.\nThe familiar double standard almost broke Drexel’s spirit again. His family always treated him and his sister differently, and now even the robot was doing the same.\nTheir first dinner at the military academy passed in Drexel’s gloom.\nAfter dinner, the two headed to the training center to start their mecha training for the night.\n\"Are we going to train on the Interstellarnet or in the Dimensional Battlefield tonight?\" Arix asked Drexel.\n\"Of course, the Interstellarnet. Let’s go, I’ll show you something exciting,\" Drexel said with a mischievous smile, eagerly taking out a holo-connective pod. He quickly opened the pod, lay inside smoothly, and logged into the Interstellarnet world.\nArix bit her lip, feeling a bit uneasy. But then she thought,\n’the Interstellarnet world can’t kill me, so there’s nothing to be afraid of!’\nAfter reassuring herself, Arix also took out her connective pod and lay inside.\n\"Welcome to the Interstellarnet.\"\nAs the gentle female voice sounded, Arix opened her eyes and found herself with Drexel at the edge of a forest.\n\"What are we doing here?\" Arix asked. She thought they would be at a mecha battle arena, but instead, they were in a forest.\n\"Hehe, it’s a secret. Follow me, and you’ll find out,\" Drexel said with a mysterious smile and a sly grin.\nHe then pulled a Supergiant-Class mecha, entered the cockpit, and started a self-check to ensure there were no problems.\nNot understanding what Drexel was planning, Arix could only sigh and start preparing her own mecha.\nAfter browsing the Interstellarnet marketplace for a while, she chose a Supergiant-Class star-class mecha with similar stats to her previous Star Dust.\nReluctantly, she spent quite a fortune to buy the virtual mecha.\nTaking out the virtual mecha, Arix swiftly entered the cockpit and began her own checks.\nAfter a few minutes, the siblings confirmed their mechas were fine and headed into the forest, one after the other.\n...\nIn the heart of the tropical forest, two mechas, one red and one blue, lurked in the shadows. They silently observed as the teams ahead battled a massive beast boss.\nThe pilot of the red mecha was Arix. She had been lying low with Drexel for quite some time.\nUnable to hold back any longer, she asked, \"Aren’t we going to join the fight?\"\nArix had expected Drexel to lead her into the fray against the beast. But instead, they had been crouching here for over half an hour, merely watching others engage the beast.\n\"Almost there. Just a bit longer,\" Drexel replied, his eyes locked on the nearly defeated beast in the distance, trying to soothe Arix.\nArix rolled her eyes but continued watching the battle unfold.\nTen mecha teams were fighting the beast, each team composed of about five or six members.\nLike Drexel and Arix, many others hid in the shadows. Including those in stealth mode, there were easily over a hundred people.\nAfter counting the participants, Arix focused on the beast. In this holographic instance on the interstellarnet, defeating beasts and insectoids yielded rewards, which dropped automatically upon the prey’s demise.\nThese rewards ranged from interstellarnet coins and mecha materials to potion ingredients. The higher the level of the prey, the better the materials and the more plentiful the rewards.\nThe beast they observed was a small but high-value target, attracting everyone’s attention.\nCurrently, this Star-Class beast had only 8% of its health left. Victory was near, but in its weakened state, the beast had entered a berserk mode, boosting its power to Subgiant-Class.\nThe promise of imminent victory drove the mecha pilots into a frenzy. Even some of those hiding couldn’t resist joining the attack.\nThe original attackers scorned these opportunists, but most of them were too exhausted to do much about it. A few strong teams tried to fend them off while attacking the beast, but most of the firepower remained focused on the beast.\nAfter watching for a long time, Arix suddenly realized Drexel’s plan. Nervously, she swallowed and asked, \"Are you planning to steal their killing at the last moment?\"\nKill Stealing in games always sparks anger, and it’s no different in this virtual training ground.\nJust imagining being hunted by everyone made Arix shiver.\nDrexel’s mecha turned to Arix, giving her a thumbs up. \"Smart girl! You guessed it right! Now rise up a bit, because you’re going to run for your life.\"\nSuddenly, Drexel’s mecha stood up. He gripped a laser gun with both hands and fired at the beast. With just a sliver of health left, the beast was instantly killed.\nThe air went silent. Every mecha pilot on the battlefield stared in Drexel’s direction.\nDrexel, meanwhile, was happily inspecting the new items in his backpack. He even pulled out the most valuable mecha material, showing it off. \"Wow, the beast dropped some good stuff. Too bad it’s ours now. You all can just watch and be jealous. Here, Arix, this precious item is for you.\"\nDrexel tossed the alloy orb to the dumbfounded Arix.\nAs countless hostile eyes focused on her, Arix finally grasped the situation.\nShe looked at Drexel, speechless, and said, \"Gosh, why do you have to do that? Even if it’s training, this is way too intense.\"\n\"Arix, you’ve got me wrong. This is for our own good. Also, we have to leave now. Run!\" Drexel said, bolting into the forest as if his butt were on fire.\nJust as Drexel fled, a terrifying laser blast hit the spot where he had just been, creating a meter-deep crater.\nArix glanced nervously toward the battlefield. She saw countless mecha pilots, cursing and charging at her with deadly intent.\n\"Die, thief!\"\n\"Take this!\"\n\"Don’t you dare run!\"\nNot running would mean getting beaten up.\nArix screamed, quickly storing the alloy in her backpack. Then she piloted her mecha, desperately running in the direction her brother had gone.\nBehind her, countless bullets and blasts rained down like there was no tomorrow.\nThe attacks were so dense that Arix had to jump, twist, and roll dramatically to dodge them. With these relentless chasers, her escape skills improved greatly. Though flustered at first, once she got the hang of it, very few could keep up with her.\nNo one knew how long Arix had been running, but eventually, only a few people were still chasing her. Most, realizing they couldn’t catch up, had given up.\nWhen there was only one soldier left on her tail, Arix decided to stop. She halted and gasped for breath, looking back at her pursuer. \"Really? You chased me this far for an alloy orb?\"\n\"Do you think I wanted to chase you? I just need this one material to repair my mecha!\" the persistent pilot replied, also gasping for air.\nFrom his hoarse voice, it was clear he was on the verge of collapse too.",

      "content": "Chapter 176: Deicide\nArix shot him a respectful glance before tossing a piece of rock at the mecha.\nThe pilot panicked, thinking Arix was attacking and had thrown a boom.\nHe almost dodged but then saw what it really was. It was the alloy orb he had been chasing for miles, the one he’d been dreaming of.\nWithout a second thought, he caught it like it was a treasure.\n\"Why did you give this to me?\" His rough voice softened, sounding awkward.\nHe seemed a bit shy and touched.\nArix rolled her eyes, feeling detached. \"Think of it as me being tired. I’m logging off, goodbye.\"\n\"Hey, wait, at least let’s be friends!\" he called out, sounding desperate.\nArix didn’t stop. She logged off even faster.\nShe couldn’t believe someone who had chased her for miles just wanted to be friends.\nIf he added her as a friend now, it was probably to get back at her later!\n’Ha, I’m not falling for that!’\nArix vanished quickly, leaving the pilot standing there.\nHe murmured regretfully, \"I really wanted to be your friend...\"\nOnce out of the interstellarnet, Arix was ready to give Drexel a good lesson.\nBut when she got out of the Connective Pod, Drexel’s spot next to her was already empty.\nTurns out Drexel had sneaked away a while ago.\nArix sighed.\n’When it comes to brazen, Drexel takes the cake!’\n\"Master, it’s very late now. You should sleep,\" said PO. He had been the loyal guardian of the Connective Pod.\nStill gritting her teeth, Arix managed to hold back her rage and told PO gently, \"Okay, I know.\"\nAfter a few deep breaths to calm down, Arix tidied herself up and went to bed.\nFive days went by, and it was Saturday.\nDuring those days, aside from giving Drexel a good beating, Arix attended her mecha practical classes in the Department of Combat.\nAt night, she joined Elio and the others in the interstellarnet to raid bosses.\nSince the escape training on the first day went so well, Arix spent the following days getting familiar with common weapons and basic mecha combos.\nWhen she’s not having mecha trainings, Arix mostly stayed in her bedroom or study, devouring the books and notes Bryndel and Magen had given her.\nDuring this time, Sims also video-called to check on Arix’s progress.\nPleased with her results, he sent over a bunch of potion books and notes from famous people on the opticomputer.\nArix didn’t mind having more books. She treated each one like a hidden treasure.\nUnderstanding these books wasn’t easy. Arix relied on interstellarnet searches and hands-on practice in the lab to fully grasp the knowledge.\nKNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK.\nThe sound of knocking came, followed by Drexel’s voice outside.\n\"Arix, it’s time to get up. Elio and Cirilla will be here in half an hour.\" This time, Drexel knocked gently, remembering the lesson from last time when his ear hurt.\nHearing Drexel’s voice, Arix slowly opened her eyes and, after a moment of confusion, remembered.\nToday, they were going with Elio and the others to the Second Legion to compete against the Dragon Clan from the Empire.\n\"Got it, I’m getting up now,\" Arix said hoarsely. She scratched her messy hair and headed to the bathroom.\nAfter washing up, Arix went to the dining room and saw only her mom there.\n\"Mom, where are Dad and Kellan?\" Arix asked curiously.\nShe hadn’t seen them since last night.\n\"They are on a mission. They probably won’t be back this week,\" Fleur explained casually, used to this routine.\n\"Oh, I see. By the way, Mom, Drexel and I are going to Planet Snorri today. We’ll be back by tomorrow afternoon,\" Arix informed Fleur, thinking about the trip with Drexel.\nFleur thought they were going out to play and smiled, \"Going to see Elio?\"\n\"Sort of,\" Arix replied with a guilty look in her eyes.\nShe didn’t want Fleur to worry, so she had to keep things vague.\n\"Go ahead, have fun,\" Fleur said gently, giving her daughter a few more words of advice.\nThen she looked at Drexel with a warning tone, \"Take good care of your sister. If she loses even a nail, you’ll be in trouble.\"\nDrexel rolled his eyes secretly and grudgingly agreed while eating.\nAfter breakfast, Drexel and Arix hurriedly said goodbye to Fleur. They took a Lev and headed to the space station.\nAs soon as they arrived, they seamlessly boarded the Second Legion’s warship.\n\"Arix, Drexel, we’ve been waiting for you,\" Elio greeted them warmly at the ship’s entrance.\nBehind him stood an elderly man in a tailcoat, who bowed respectfully when he saw the siblings, \"Mr. Kering, Miss Kering, good morning.\"\n\"Good morning, sir. Please, just call us by our names,\" Drexel said, pulling his sister along as they returned the bow.\nThis old man was the butler of the Lasair family. He had watched many of the young masters and misses grow up, so his status was second only to the Lasair family members.\n\"Mr. Kering, Miss Kering, you flatter me. I won’t delay you any longer. Please, go ahead and talk,\" the butler said respectfully, bowing again.\nDrexel smiled and nodded. Then he looked at Elio and asked, \"Has everybody arrived?\"\n\"They’re all in the meeting room. We were just waiting for you two. Follow me; we need to discuss the strategy for the competition,\" Elio said, leading the way.\nDrexel and Arix quickly followed, not wanting to waste any time.\nIn the meeting room, there were six competitors along with Admiral Sykes from the Second Legion, who was overseeing the competition.\n\"Hi, Mr. Laisair,\" Arix and Drexel greeted him as soon as they walked in.\nSykes smiled, gave a nod, and said, \"Sit down.\"\nThe siblings took their seats.\nOnce everyone was settled, Sykes took a moment to look around, pride evident in his eyes as he glanced at the six young faces before him.\nElio, Cirilla, Zephyr, Varden, Drexel, and Arix.\nThese six were the future of the Alliance, especially the young girl from the Kering family. Sykes felt a mix of pride and the bittersweet realization that his generation was passing the torch.\nWith those thoughts swirling, Sykes finally began outlining the competition.\n\"This year, the competition takes place around Planet Dunesphere, right on the front lines. It’s dangerous out there, even for seasoned soldiers. Your safety is the top priority. If things get too risky, you must withdraw immediately. This isn’t a suggestion—it’s an order!\" Sykes said, his tone serious.\nThe six competitors exchanged glances and then nodded in agreement.\nSykes, satisfied, continued, \"The task is straightforward—at least, it sounds that way. The team whose mecha lasts the longest and takes down the most insectoids during the insectoid wave wins. Sounds easy, right?\"\nHe gave a humorous wink, but the young competitors stayed silent.\nElio broke the silence, asking, \"Grandpa, are you sure it’s an insectoid wave? There are only six of us. Can we really handle that?\"\nSykes nodded confidently. \"Don’t worry, lasting an hour will be no problem.\"\nElio, looking worried, responded, \"That’s not what I mean. We’re just kids. Are we taking down the insectoid wave, or is it taking us down?\"\nSykes, annoyed, snorted. \"Elio, show some backbone! The Empire’s mecha teams aren’t scared, and neither should our Alliance’s teams be! Right?\"\nHe looked around for support.\nZephyr, eyeing the ten billion astrocredits, finally nodded coolly.\nCirilla, on the other hand, was buzzing with excitement. To her, the thrill of battling the insectoid wave was even more enticing than the prize money.\nDrexel was all about the ten billion astrocredits. He’d take on an insectoid wave, a broodmother—whatever it took for that prize.\nVarden was just there for the fun. He nodding indifferently, not really fazed by anything.\nArix had a dual motive: she wanted the money and thought the experience would be incredible.\nSeeing everyone onboard, Sykes’ smile grew wider. He then cast a disdainful look at his hesitant grandson.\nElio had no choice but to keep his mouth shut.",

      "content": "Chapter 177: Arriving At The Frontline\n\"Sir, isn’t the timing of the insectoid wave unpredictable? What if we can’t compete when it happens?\" Drexel, concerned about losing his shot at the ten billion astrocredits, asked urgently.\nSykes’ smile faded a bit, but he kept his calm. \"Don’t worry. We can predict the insectoid wave now.\"\nDrexel didn’t understand how, but he didn’t push further since the competition was still on.\nThey moved on to discuss roles.\nZephyr, though quiet, had sharp command skills and would lead, handling long-range attacks with his unmatched marksmanship.\nCirilla, Drexel, Elio, and Varden were the main attackers, ready to fight head-on.\nArix was both a main attacker and support, versatile enough to fill any role as needed.\nWith positions settled, Sykes dismissed them to rest and prepare for the battle ahead.\nOnce the young competitors left, Sykes revealed a hidden screen. Throughout the discussion, a group had been watching their every move.\nThose are the\n\"Admiral Thaddeus, and the four Vice Admirals—are you satisfied with these kids?\" Sykes asked, his eyes slightly red as he addressed the five vice admirals on the screen.\nThaddeus smiled proudly, \"Of course we are. They are our future successors.\"\nSylis, Cirilla’s father, added with a smile, \"Sir, we don’t know if we can come back, so please take care of the kids.\"\n\"Sylis, don’t say that ever again, or I’ll beat you up when we meet,\" Sykes said, half-jokingly. \"Remember, you all will come back. We’re just stopping the insectoid queen’s birth. Even if the surprise attack fails, the level-eight mecha will bring you back, right?\"\nThe five mysterious figures behind the vice admirals nodded slightly. Their powerful presence was palpable, even through the screen.\nThaddeus remained silent, sharing the same hope as Sykes.\nTheir plan for the raid was named \"Mission: Deicide.\"\nThe objective of this mission was to destroy the energy fruit. That fruit was critical for the birth of the new insectoid queen.\nDestroying this fruit would delay the queen’s birth by at least ten years, granting the Alliance and the entire universe a decade of peace.\nTo pull off this mission, not just the Alliance but countries far and wide had sent at least one Vice Admiral-level mecha pilot.\nThis elite team of Vice Admirals, over a thousand strong, was set to face at least one hundred thousand insectoids of the same caliber.\nOn top of that, there were billions of other insectoids of varying levels to contend with.\nSuccess or failure, their chances of returning alive were slim. If they succeeded, they would be swarmed and likely killed by countless insectoids. If they failed, they would face the same grim fate.\nFortunately, the Alliance had level-eight mechas. Those incredibly powerful machines could significantly boost the survival chances of the Alliance’s Vice Admirals.\n...\nThaddeus glanced at the level-eight mecha standing next to him. This mecha was barely half a meter tall.\nIf Arix were here, she’d probably gasp. Their legendary level-eight mecha turned out to be just the campus butler, PO.\n\"Shadow Blade, it’s all yours,\" Thaddeus said with a smile.\nPO shot Thaddeus a cold look, the expression on his screen looking slightly annoyed. \"Shadow Blade, a name for fighting and killing, doesn’t suit someone as cute as me. Admiral Thaddeus, please call me PO, thank you.\"\nThaddeus chuckled. \"Alright, PO.\"\nPO glanced at him once more, then nodded in satisfaction.\nSykes watched Thaddeus interact with their level-eight mechas, a smile in his eyes. He solemnly reminded them of a few things before saluting. \"I won’t take up more of your time. Good luck and come back safe.\"\nThe five Vice Admirals returned the salute and nodded to each other. They ended the video call and set off on their mission.\nSykes looked at the now dark screen. He put away his opticomputer and leaned back in his chair. Then he closed his eyes in silence, muttering, \"Everyone, come back safely...\"\nMeanwhile, Arix and her team were in the battleship’s cafeteria, eating and chatting about the insectoid wave.\n\"Elio, when did the Second Legion figure out how to predict the insectoid wave’s timing?\" Drexel asked curiously.\n\"I have no clue. Maybe I should ask later,\" Elio replied, looking puzzled.\n\"Better not. If they have a method, it’s probably a military secret. They wouldn’t tell us anyway,\" Drexel said, feeling relaxed.\n\"True. Let’s not dwell on that. Let’s talk about the Empire’s mecha team. From what I’ve heard, things aren’t looking good,\" Elio said, frowning.\nDrexel, intrigued by Elio’s concern, raised an eyebrow. \"Go on.\"\nElio sighed, looking serious. \"In the Empire’s mecha team, three members are purebloods. To be a pureblood, their physical or psychic power must be at Supergiant+ level. We only have you, Drexel, who can match a pureblood. So, we’re already at a disadvantage.\"\nHearing this, Zephyr and the others also looked serious.\n\"We won’t necessarily lose. This time, it’s not about psychic or physical power. It’s about who can kill more insectoids and hold off the wave longer. If we’re lucky, maybe the insectoid wave on the Empire’s side will be even more intense,\" Drexel said, crossing his arms and leaning back in his chair.\nEven though his words sounded shameless, everyone felt oddly comforted.\nElio clasped his hands together in a gesture of blessing. \"Then let’s hope the insectoid wave on the Empire’s side is fiercer.\"\nHearing this, the others laughed.\nAbout half an hour later, Arix and her team finally arrived at Dunesphere and saw the Second Legion’s starship carrier. Once they entered the starship carrier’s safety zone, their battleship landed on the carrier’s deck under the guidance of the sentry.\nAs soon as Arix and her team disembarked, they quickly suited up in their mechas and followed Sykes to the competition area.\nIn the cockpit, Arix observed the space environment while listening to the conversation in her wireless earpiece.\nAs they were about to meet their opponents, Elio excitedly shouted over the channel, \"Guys, get ready for battle! Let’s defeat those Empire scum!\"\n\"Elio, can you keep it down? You’re going to make me deaf,\" Cirilla said, annoyed.\n\"Sorry, sorry,\" Elio quickly apologized, not daring to provoke Cirilla.\n\"Oh, I see them. They don’t look easy to deal with, especially with their top-notch equipment,\" Drexel said, eyeing the opposing mecha team enviously.\nElio, feeling irritated by Drexel’s words, took out five weapons from his Space Button and handed them to his teammates.\nArix and the others each received a top-tier weapon in their respective fields.\nArix got a sword and, upon examining it, she realized it was made of meteoric iron. She was so amazed that she almost drooled. Meteoric iron was a material naturally forged through cosmic friction.\nHer teammates were equally smitten with their new weapons. Zephyr got a particle gun, Varden received a heavy sword, Cirilla got a long whip, and Drexel received a spear.\n\"If we win this battle, these weapons are yours,\" Elio announced generously, seeing how much everyone liked them.\nAs soon as he finished speaking, five sounds of swallowing echoed simultaneously.\nDrexel, unable to contain his excitement, hugged Elio and vowed, \"Don’t worry, Mr. Laisair, we will complete the mission!\"\nWith their new weapons, their spirits instantly soared. They eyed the Empire’s mecha team like wolves eyeing lambs. Even their mechas’ eyes seemed to gleam with titanium light.\nThis creepy, intense gaze made the Empire’s mecha team feel both belittled and insulted. Their already unfriendly expressions became even more hostile, and they maliciously gave Arix and her team the middle finger.\nHowever, in their good mood, Arix and her team saw the provocation and reacted as if they were looking at fools, their faces full of amusement.\nThe two mecha teams from the Empire and the Alliance glared at each other, their eyes and noses full of contempt.\nAt that time, the leaders from both sides were \"cordially\" shaking hands and reminiscing.\n\"Mr. Vesryn, you arrived early. You’re so eager! I thought you’re as cold-blooded as other reptiles. Maybe you should see a doctor,\" Sykes said, holding Vesryn’s hand with a falsely concerned smile.\n\"It’s clearly you, Lord Sykes, who arrived late. If you’d been any later, I might have thought the Alliance mecha team was too scared to show up,\" Vesryn replied with a sarcastic smile.\n\"How could that be? If you have the guts to show up, why wouldn’t we?\" Sykes retorted with a mocking smile, pretending not to understand Vesryn’s insinuations.",

      "content": "Chapter 178: Cheaters\nSykes and Vesryn were busy throwing sarcastic comments at each other, stopping only when the insectoid wave got too close. They quickly called in their respective mecha squads, ready to face the threat.\nSykes looked over the Supergiant-Class mecha pilots assembled before him. With a stern expression, he said, \"I won’t say much. Just remember, if things get too dangerous, don’t hesitate to pull back. Got it?\"\n\"Understood, Admiral!\" the pilots, Arix included, replied in unison.\nSykes nodded approvingly and gave a few more pointers. Once done, Sykes and Vesryn exchanged contemptuous looks, then barked out orders together, \"Everyone, take your positions! Prepare for battle!\"\nWith that command, the mecha squads from both the Empire and the Alliance moved into position, ready to face the incoming insectoid swarm.\nThe armies from both sides cleared the area, giving the two squads space to prove themselves.\nThis decision, though, didn’t sit well with everyone. In the Empire, where the strong thrive, the move was accepted—young soldiers often faced such trials.\nBut on the Alliance side, soldiers thought their leaders were being reckless.\n\"This is a battlefield, not a playground! They shouldn’t be treating it like a competition for these kids,\" grumbled one of the military mecha squad members over the team channel.\n\"We’re up against an insectoid wave. If they fail to hold the line and the starship carriers behind us get hit, we’re done for,\" another chimed in angrily.\nThe military mecha squad was uneasy, feeling the decision was too risky. The squad leader shared their concerns but knew he couldn’t challenge the orders from above. He sighed, \"Let’s watch and see. If things go south, we step in immediately.\"\n\"Yes, sir!\" The squad members replied, feeling a bit better knowing they had a backup plan. Even if it meant stepping in to save the day, they preferred action over idleness.\nMeanwhile, on the front lines, Arix and her team were getting frustrated. They had already fought off two waves of insectoids, while the Empire’s mecha squad hadn’t seen of that. They just stood there, watching the Alliance team handle the threat.\nThe Empire’s mecha squad stood by, watching the Alliance squad struggle with the insectoid wave. Elio, noticing the difference, complained, \"Wow! It turns out the insectoid wave on our side is much stronger.\"\n\"Seriously, it feels like these bugs are favoring them,\" Drexel added, as they watched the insectoids avoid the Empire’s side and head straight for the Alliance.\nCirilla, having just decapitated an insectoid with her whip, tried to reassure her teammates, \"The insectoids at the start of the wave are usually weaker. Let’s treat this as a warm-up.\"\n\"Keep your moves simple and conserve your energy,\" Zephyr advised calmly.\n\"Understood!\" Arix and the others responded in unison.\nFollowing Zephyr’s advice, their mecha movements became more efficient, clearly aimed at conserving energy. This was a letdown for the Empire’s mecha squad, who had hoped the Alliance team would wear themselves out quickly.\nAs time went on, the insectoid attacks became stronger. The Empire’s squad also started facing their share of the wave. The previously uneven distribution of attacks evened out, with both squads now fully engaged in the battle.\nMinutes stretched into half an hour, and then into an hour... Both squads transitioned from sharp and focused to visibly worn out.\n\"Watch out!\" Arix shouted, as she intercepted an insectoid attempting to ambush Varden. She quickly swung her sword, slicing the insectoid in half.\n\"Thanks!\" Varden panted, clearly exhausted. He was struggling, his hands trembling as he gripped his sword.\nSeeing this, Zephyr immediately instructed, \"Varden, fall back and recover. Arix, can you hold the line for a while?\"\n\"I can do it!\" Arix responded with determination, tightening her grip on her sword.\nShe had been picking off stragglers and weaker targets, but now it was time for her to take on a bigger role.\nThough still a beginner compared to Drexel and the others, she felt it was her time to step up.\nTaking a deep breath, Arix moved forward and swapped places with Varden.\nHowever, facing the full force of the insectoid attack, she hesitated, unsure whether to block or strike first.\nThis moment of uncertainty allowed several insectoids to breach their defense line.\n\"Arix, stay calm; we’re here!\" Zephyr shouted, taking down an insectoid that had slipped through.\n\"Don’t worry, Arix. We’ve got your back!\" Cirilla encouraged, though she was panting heavily.\n\"Arix, keep going!\" Drexel, who was in the best condition, moved closer to help reduce the pressure on her.\n\"If you can’t handle it, I’ll take over!\" Varden offered, worried for her safety.\nHearing everyone’s concern and encouragement, Arix felt a warmth spread through her heart. She bit her lower lip and declared, \"Thank you, everyone. I can do this!\"\nWith renewed determination, Arix launched into the fray, slashing at the insectoids with all her might.\nHer fierce attacks held back the swarm, but she quickly realized that this approach was draining her energy at an alarming rate. It wasn’t sustainable.\n’What should I do?’\nArix’s mind raced, sifting through her training and past experiences.\nThen, she remembered Scion’s technique—using a single sword strike to unleash a powerful energy blade capable. That strike would wipe out insectoids within a hundred meters.\nThat technique required a combination an energy stone with psychic power; the stronger the psychic power, the more potent the attack.\nArix wasn’t sure if she could pull it off, but she was running out of options. She decided to give it a shot.\nHer mecha, Starfall, suddenly ceased its movements. She gripped her sword tightly with both hands, focusing her energy.\nAs an insectoid lunged at her, Varden instinctively moved to help, but Drexel stopped him.\n\"Trust her!\" Drexel said with a confident smile, watching his sister closely.\nVarden hesitated, frowning in confusion, but chose to step back and trust Arix’s judgment.\nArix recalled Scion’s precise movements as she channeled her mecha’s energy along with her psychic powers into her sword.\nAs the insectoid’s sharp limbs closed in, just a meter away, Arix’s mecha sprang into action.\nShe swung the sword with a swift motion, releasing a 30-meter-wide blade of energy that cleaved through all the insectoids within a 50-meter radius.\nThis incredible display of power left her teammates in awe, and even Arix couldn’t believe what she’d just done.\n\"Wow, Arix, that was awesome!\" Elio exclaimed, clearly impressed.\n\"Well done,\" Zephyr added, his tone calm but carrying a hint of pride.\n\"That’s my sister!\" Cirilla cheered, giving Arix a thumbs up while cracking her whip.\n\"That’s a big step; you’ve proved you can hold your own!\" Varden grinned.\nDrexel didn’t say a word but raised his mecha’s thumb above his head, and the he even blew a kiss. Arix, feeling a bit overwhelmed by the compliments, felt her stomach turn at Drexel’s over-the-top gesture.\nElio and the others cringed, while Zephyr shot Drexel a frosty glare, even firing a shot to stop him from doing anything more.\n\"Hey, Zephyr, be careful!\" Drexel snapped, irritated at being interrupted.\n\"My bad, hand slipped,\" Zephyr replied coolly, face expressionless.\nDrexel didn’t push it further, and he turned his attention back to the battle with the insectoids.\nThe rest of the team subtly signaled their approval to Zephyr.\nWith Arix’s newfound ability to unleash the energy blade, the pressure eased off Elio and the others.\nZephyr quickly organized shifts so they could take turns resting. After getting his own mecha team sorted, Zephyr turned his focus to the Empire’s mecha team.\nBoth teams were looking worn out, though the Empire’s team had been slightly stronger initially. But with Arix’s unexpected assistance, things were now evenly matched.\nThe two groups seemed like fraying ropes being sliced by knives, each side waiting to see who would break first.\nAs time dragged on, a member of the Empire’s team fell, soon followed by one from the Alliance’s side.\n\"Take a break!\" Zephyr called out, helping Varden back to the cockpit.\n\"Sorry...\" Varden mumbled, exhausted from the strain of using both psychic and physical energy, before passing out.\nThe battle seemed almost cursed, with team members dropping one by one. Elio, Cirilla, and the others...\nNow, only three from each side remained, both the Empire’s and the Alliance’s teams dwindling down to the last few fighters.",

      "content": "Chapter 179: Drexel’s Moment\nArix’s vision started to blur; she had lost track of how many insectoids she had taken down. Gasping for breath, she glanced over at Drexel, who looked just as exhausted. She clenched her fists and pressed on. She knew she couldn’t afford to collapse. If she did, her brother and Zephyr would be left to fend off the swarm alone, making victory for the Alliance mecha team seem almost impossible.\nAnother Empire mecha team member fell after a few intense moments.\nHowever, the relief was short-lived as Zephyr also went down, leaving only Drexel and a barely-standing Arix still in the fight.\n\"Arix, don’t push yourself too hard,\" Drexel urged, noticing her mecha’s unsteady movements. He was panting heavily but still in good enough shape to potentially secure their win.\nToo tired to respond, Arix simply shook her head and kept moving, cutting down more insectoids.\nThe siblings’ relentless determination left the military mechas, who had once doubted them, speechless.\n\"Maybe we owe them an apology,\" one pilot murmured, guilt creeping into his voice.\n\"Fighting until they drop... not even seasoned soldiers can always do that. And they’re just students,\" another pilot added, his voice thick with emotion.\n\"Damn, god to admit these kids were even better than their fathers and grandfathers,\" a soldier exclaimed, wiping away tears as he watched them.\nThe captain of the military mecha team observed the siblings with a newfound respect, his earlier disdain turning into admiration.\nThe final showdown between the Empire and Alliance mecha teams was at hand.\nArix glanced at the remaining two opponents from the Empire’s side, knowing she needed to outlast at least one more to tip the balance in their favor.\nBut things don’t always go as planned.\nSuddenly, Arix felt a sharp pain in her chest, and her already fatigued body lost all strength. Her mecha, Star Dust, lurched forward, but Drexel quickly caught her.\n\"Arix!\" Drexel called out, his voice filled with worry.\nArix couldn’t speak, the pain in her chest was too intense.\nShe looked pale and was clutching her chest, curled up in the cockpit. She didn’t know what was happening, but a sense of dread washed over her.\n\"Dad...\" Arix whispered hoarsely, not knowing why she said it. An image flashed in her mind—a scene deep in space, where it seemed like a catastrophe was unfolding.\nCountless terrifying insectoids were chasing after someone.\nThaddeus had a split second to decide whether to climb into Shadow Blade’s cockpit, but instead, he chose to save Sylis, who was in immediate danger.\nIn a cruel twist, an insectoid struck Thaddeus from behind, piercing his head.\nUsing the last of his strength, he shoved Sylis toward safety, but Thaddeus himself plummeted into the abyss below, blood streaming from his wound.\nDown in the depths, countless insectoids waited, mouths agape, ready to finish him off.\n\"Dad!\" Arix screamed, her voice choked with despair.\nHer eyes were bloodshot, veins popping with stress, and she spat out a mouthful of blood before losing consciousness.\nAs darkness took over, time seemed to slow. From her heart, a Psychic Incarnation emerged. Its emerald eyes brimmed with sorrow. With a gentle sigh, the creature faded away, leaving a lingering sense of melancholy in the air.\nTwo military mecha pilots swiftly took Arix away. Drexel shot a worried look in Arix’s direction but quickly turned his focus back to battling the insectoids.\nA lingering doubt tickled the back of his mind,\n’Did I hear Arix call out \"Dad\" earlier?’\n’Was Arix feeling too desperate, or just too much pain?’\nThe more Drexel pondered, the more it seemed possible. This realization drove him to fight even harder, determined to avenge Arix’s distress.\nMeanwhile, the Empire mecha team noticed the chaos among the Alliance forces.\n\"Serves them right,\" Kares sneered, watching another Alliance pilot go down. \"Those Alliance scum deserve it.\"\nGalen, a pure-blood merman, asked innocently, \"Are we going to use the drugs again later?\"\nKares, annoyed by Galen’s naivety, replied with a sneer, \"Why bother? They’ve only got one pilot left, and we have two. We’ve got this in the bag.\"\n\"Oh, shoot. Forgot that,\" Galen sighed in relief, glad they wouldn’t have to deal with the harsh side effects of the drug.\nAs another ten minutes ticked by, Galen began to falter. He chimed in again, \"I can’t hold out much longer.\" His body felt heavy, and his head throbbed. All he wanted was to return to the sea and rest.\nKares cursed under his breath. Glancing at the Alliance team, he saw Drexel, piloting the Blue Raven mecha, still cutting through the insectoids without showing any signs of slowing down.\nDetermination hardened in Kares’ eyes, and he finally gave in, \"Take the drug!\"\nWith hesitation, Galen pulled out a red pill from his Space Button and swallowed it.\nImmediately, his psychic and physical strength surged back, and he resumed fighting the insectoids with renewed vigor.\nNot long after, Kares also hit his limit. He reluctantly took out a red pill and gulped it down.\nThey needed that mineral-rich planet to boost the Dragonkin Legion’s strength. Losing wasn’t an option.\nUnaware of the Empire team’s cheating, Drexel only noticed that Kares seemed stronger than before.\nIt was lucky Drexel had recently leveled up his physical abilities at the Empire, or he might not have lasted this long.\nDrexel was slowly reaching his breaking point. He glanced over at the Empire team, who still fought on tirelessly.\nThe comparison was stark, and despair began to creep in inside Drexel; the odds of his winning seemed slim.\nDrexel thought about his fallen teammates and his sister, who had cried out for their father in a moment of desperation.\nLosing wasn’t an option.\nThis wasn’t just about the 10 billion astracredits for him now; it was about protecting his friends and his sister. This battle was one they absolutely couldn’t afford to lose.\n\"Sheer! I need your help,\" Drexel finally called out to his Psychic Incarnation, feeling his strength waning.\nIn his psychic realm, Sheer slowly opened his eyes. The two big eyes glowed with a deep and intimidating majesty.\n\"Worry not, Drexel, I’ll help you,\" Sheer responded calmly.\nDrexel allowed himself a slight smile as he surrendered to sleep.\n...\nWhen \"Drexel\" woke up again in Blue Raven, one of his eyes had turned a deep red, and a pair of animal ears had appeared on his head.\n\"Drexel\" stretched, a wild grin spreading across his face. \"It’s been a while since I’ve had some fun. Let’s show these insectoids what we’re made of.\"\nBlue Raven surged with renewed energy, extending the range of its energy blade from 20 meters to 50 meters.\nWith fewer insectoids attacking, the Blue Raven mecha even started hunting them down.\nThis odd behavior made Kares from the Empire mecha team suspicious, thinking Drexel might have taken some kind of drug.\nIf he hadn’t taken the drug himself, Kares would definitely report Drexel.\nHowever, knowing both he and Galen had taken the drug, Kares dismissed the thought begrudgingly.\nAfter another half hour, the drug’s side effects hit hard. Both Kares and Galen vomited blood and passed out simultaneously.\nWith the Empire mecha team down, the Alliance mecha team was declared the winner.\nVesryn, looking displeased, turned to Sykes and said, \"Your team cheated. How else could someone almost defeated suddenly come back to life?\"\n\"It sounds more like you’re talking about your own team,\" Sykes retorted with a cold smile.\nVesryn’s face flushed with anger before he finally sneered, \"Lucky for you!\"\nVesryn then piloted his mecha away, his retreat looking somewhat like a hasty escape.\nSykes sneered but let it go, focusing instead on the fact that they had won.\nTurning his attention to Drexel, who was still battling the insectoids, Sykes felt a pang of worry.\nWhether Drexel had taken drugs or not, he knew Drexel must have paid some price to keep going this long.\nSykes quickly pressed a few buttons on his headset, inputting a special code to access the communication channel of Drexel’s mecha team.\n\"Drexel, that’s enough! We’ve already won,\" Sykes shouted firmly.\n\"Drexel,\" now controlled by Sheer, clicked his tongue in disappointment as he heard Sykes’ voice in his headset.\nReluctantly, he retreated back into the psychic world.\nAs soon as Sheer withdrew, the Blue Raven mecha crumpled, but Sykes, having anticipated this, caught the falling mecha just in time.\nSykes personally escorted Drexel to the medical bay, then waited outside, anxiously hoping for updates on the team’s condition.\nJust as he was about to check on Drexel, his opticomputer beeped with an incoming call. He glanced at the screen and casually accepted the video call.\nThe moment the call connected, the officer on the screen urgently asked, \"Is Arix with you? You must bring her back immediately! Admiral Thaddeus is critically ill!\"\nSykes stared at the screen, disbelief and shock written all over his face. \"How could this happen?! Weren’t there level-eight mecha protecting them? What went wrong?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 180: Other Patients\nThe officer on the other end of the line was clueless too, shaking his head slightly.\nThen he spoke with urgency, \"Admiral Thaddeus’s psychic world is completely wrecked, and his Psychic Incarnation is gone. The hospital is barely keeping him alive. The only hope is to find Arix, who developed the psychic healer. She might be able to save him. So, sir, we need Arix here, and fast!\"\nSykes responded, \"Got it! Hang tight! I’ll be there!\" He hung up and rushed into the medical room, scooping up the unconscious Arix from her bed.\n\"Sir, what are you doing...?\" a medical staff member asked, puzzled.\n\"I’m taking her to save someone,\" Sykes answered briskly, hurrying out. The medical team watched him leave, shaking their heads in disbelief.\nThey turned back to Drexel’s bed, only to see it empty.\n’Where did HE go? He just vanished into thin air?’\nThey couldn’t believe it and searched the room, even checking under the bed.\nJust as they considered reporting it, a message from Sykes came through: \"Your patient left with me. No need to report.\"\nThe medical staff were speechless. They couldn’t stand patients who ignored the medical team and family members who didn’t respect boundaries.\nOn the Space Station, Sykes, carrying Arix, looked seriously at Drexel and asked, \"Are you sure you want to come with me? Can you handle it?\"\n\"I’m fine, sir, let’s go,\" Drexel replied, despite feeling weak and exhausted. He was worried about his father and sister, pushing through his fatigue.\nHe had a nagging feeling something was seriously wrong. Sykes and Arix’s strange behavior, especially Arix crying for their father, made him think it wasn’t just about losing a game.\nThe more Drexel thought about it, the more guilty he felt for not realizing sooner.\nSeeing he couldn’t change Drexel’s mind, Sykes gave him a long, thoughtful look and sighed, \"Alright, come with me.\"\nWith that, Sykes led the siblings to the warp machine, and they began their journey through the space tunnel.\n...\nAt the hospital where Thaddeus stayed, the top floor was filled with officers, all looking grim as they waited in the hallway.\nWith Thaddeus in critical condition, representatives from various legions were present, including Matis, Marlone, and the President of the Alliance, Zeta.\nDespite their high ranks, everyone wore expressions of deep concern.\nMatis, Thaddeus’s father, suddenly had streaks of white hair.\nAmong all the people gathered, Sylis was probably feeling the worst. If it hadn’t been for him, Thaddeus wouldn’t be lying in that hospital bed—but, they wouldn’t have gotten three critical condition notices in just one hour, either.\nSylis hung his head in shame, clutching his hair tightly, caught between hope and fear—hoping for Thaddeus to pull through and dreading any bad news.\nHe couldn’t imagine what he would do if Thaddeus couldn’t make it, and how he could possibly compensate the Kering family.\nJust then, the hospital room door flew open, and the chief doctor urgently called out, \"Is Arix here yet? Admiral Thaddeus is barely holding on! His consciousness is fading!!\"\nMatis was deeply shaken by the doctor’s words, nearly stumbling, but Marlone caught him in time, preventing any embarrassment.\nThe crowd around them buzzed with activity, some urging Sykes to hurry, others pressing the doctor for updates.\n\"Maybe you should go home and rest,\" Marlone suggested, worried about both his Matis’ health and Thaddeus’s condition.\nBut Matis just shook his head silently, his voice hoarse as he asked, \"Is there still hope?\"\n\"Yes, there’s still hope! Of course, there’s hope! Don’t you trust me? And don’t you trust Arix? She can definitely save Thaddeus,\" Marlone reassured, though he was unsure himself.\nHe had to keep Matis calm, even if it meant exaggerating Arix’s abilities. Matis seemed to calm down a bit and joined the others in trying to reach Sykes.\nMeanwhile, Sykes, overwhelmed with calls, had no time to answer them. He was tearing through the capital city’s downtown, driving a Lev vehicle at breakneck speed towards the hospital.\nHe ran red lights, sped through the streets, drove the wrong way, and cut across lanes recklessly. His wild driving soon attracted a swarm of airborne police robots, trailing him and issuing warnings.\n\"Vehicle ahead, you have violated traffic regulations. Please pull over immediately to receive your penalty!\"\n\"Vehicle ahead, you have violated traffic regulations. Please pull over immediately to receive your penalty!\"\n\"Vehicle ahead, you have violated traffic regulations. Please pull over immediately to receive your penalty!\"\n\"Forget your penalties! If you delay me from saving a life, I’ll smash your boss’s office tomorrow!\" Sykes shouted, hitting the gas even harder, leaving the police robots behind in an instant.\n\"Sir, can we go any faster? I can feel Dad’s getting worse,\" Arix urged, her face pale with worry.\nShe’d jolted awake as soon as Thaddeus’s consciousness began to fade. Now, all she could think about was getting to her father in time to save him.\n\"Alright, hang on!\" Sykes gritted his teeth and decided to take a risky shortcut, flying directly over a residential area towards the hospital.\nThis reckless maneuver not only set off alarms for the airborne police robots but also triggered the police alerts. Soon, the wail of police sirens echoed throughout the city center.\nAt the hospital, the chief doctor was pacing in distress, repeatedly asking, \"Where is Arix? Why hasn’t she arrived yet?!\"\nThe officers exchanged anxious glances, unsure of what to do. Just then, a loud shout rang out from a distance. \"Clear the way! Clear the way! Everyone, move!\"\nThe shout caught everyone off guard. They looked around, confused, until someone pointed up and yelled, \"Look, it’s a Lev!\"\n\"What’s the big deal about a Lev?\" an officer asked, puzzled. But when they looked up, they saw the Lev vehicle hurtling towards the hospital—without slowing down at all, as if it was about to crash right into the building!\n\"Damn it! Move aside! Can’t you hear me?\" Sykes shouted at the top of his lungs.\nBut the crowd he was yelling at didn’t get mad; instead, they got even more excited. They started chanting along with Sykes, \"Clear the way, clear the way! Arix is coming!!\"\nAs soon as they heard Arix’s name, everyone quickly shuffled to the sides of the hallway.\nSykes let out a sigh of relief, then, with a determined look in his eyes, he allowed the Lev to slam into the floor-to-ceiling windows of the hospital.\nCRASH!\nThe glass shattered with a loud noise, shards flying everywhere.\nAt last, Arix had arrived at the hospital, just as everyone had been eagerly anticipating.\nShe kicked open the Lev door, ready to rush out, but a doctor, even more frantic than she was, quickly pulled her into the treatment room.\nOnce the treatment room door shut, everyone outside exhaled in relief. Just then, a squad of airborne police robots finally showed up. They came in through the broken window, surrounding Sykes with their energy guns aimed straight at him.\n\"Admiral Sykes, you are under arrest. Please come with us,\" the robots stated in their usual monotone.\nSykes shot an irritated look at the robots, clicking his tongue in annoyance. He turned to Zeta, and said, \"You, make sure to come to the police station and bail me out.\"\nZeta grinned and nodded, \"Sure thing, Uncle Sykes. Don’t worry.\"\nWith a slight pout, Sykes looked back at the air police and said, \"Alright, let’s get this over with. I’m starving. Maybe I’ll grab a bite at your station.\"\n\"Sir, meals are provided at specific times. You will need to wait three hours,\" the robot replied flatly.\n\"Three hours?! You robots are so heartless,\" Sykes grumbled, following the robots to the police vehicle.\n\"We are robots; we have no need for food. If you’re that hungry, we can get you something at the drive-through or you can place an order online,\" the robot responded seriously.\n\"Now that’s an idea. Let’s get moving; I’m starving,\" Sykes said as he was led away. The crowd, who had been amused by the exchange, finally focused back on the treatment room door.\nThe officers relaxed and started chatting about Sykes and his peculiar meal plans. Suddenly, a door creaked open, but it wasn’t the treatment room door. It was... the Lev.",

      "content": "Chapter 181: Saving Thaddeus\nThe Alliance officers turned their heads in shock, seeing someone else emerging from inside Lev.\nDrexel, who had been mostly ignored in the chaos, shakily opened the Lev door and managed to climb out, clearly struggling.\nHe looked pale and exhausted, like he might pass out at any moment. He turned to the crowd and said weakly, \"Could someone call a doctor for me, please?\"\nAnd then, Drexel collapsed to the ground.\nMarlone and Matis, recognizing him as their grandson and nephew, rushed over in concern. After a quick check, they found that Drexel was just extremely tired and not seriously hurt.\nOnce Matis knew Drexel was okay, his concern quickly shifted to criticism. He looked at Marlone with a hint of disapproval and said, \"Have you not been training him properly while he’s been on leave from the academy? Look at him, so fragile.\"\n\"Sorry, it’s my fault. I’ll make sure he toughens up when we get back,\" Marlone responded earnestly.\n\"Good. He needs to be toughened up. When you’re back, train him hard, as long as it doesn’t kill him. Got it?\" Matis instructed, nodding with approval.\n\"Got it,\" Marlone agreed, looking serious.\nThe nearby officers, overhearing this exchange, couldn’t help but feel sorry for Drexel. They silently wished him good luck, thinking,\n’Hang in there, kid.’\nMeanwhile, inside the treatment room, Arix had just entered and saw her father, Thaddeus, lying on the hospital bed.\nHis face was pale, and his breathing was shallow, making Arix’s eyes fill with tears.\n\"Dad,\" Arix whispered, gently taking Thaddeus’s hand. But there was no usual response from him; he just lay there, unresponsive.\nTears rolled down Arix’s cheeks uncontrollably. She knew her father was still in danger, so she sniffed and tried to hold back her sobs.\nThen, with a hoarse voice, she addressed the doctors, \"I’m sorry, but could you please leave us for a moment? I’ll take it from here.\"\nThe medical staff hesitated, looking to the lead doctor for guidance. The doctor didn’t object; instead, he bowed slightly and said, \"Miss Kering, we trust him in your care.\"\nArix nodded slightly and waited for the medical team to leave. She then focused on her father’s chest and spoke in a calm tone, \"Who are you?\"\nFrom the moment she held her father’s hand, Arix had sensed something unusual—a familiar energy around her father’s heart. It felt more protective than harmful, so she hadn’t acted right away.\nAfter a brief silence, just as Arix thought there would be no response, a small, ethereal creature appeared, hovering above Thaddeus’s heart.\nIt looked like a delicate version of Cupid, with two tiny horns and a gentle energy.\nThe creature had bright green eyes that radiated a soothing, all-encompassing calmness, as if anyone who gazed into those eyes could find peace and redemption.\n\"Hello, my name is Sylvana, or you could say, I’m your past life,\" the small Sylvana said, her entire presence exuding a sense of nobility and grace as she spoke.\nArix stared at the unbelievably adorable Sylvana, feeling a bit stunned. It was hard to believe something could be cuter than Cupid and the rest. The whole scene felt oddly familiar to Arix, like something straight out of a story.\nIt reminded her of the dynamic between Kikyo and Kagome, with Sylvana as Kikyo and herself as Kagome. Arix felt relieved there wasn’t an \"Inuyasha\" figure around to complicate things further with a tangled love triangle.\nBut then, thinking back to the scenes she saw in her previous life, Arix suddenly asked, \"Hello, Sylvana, I’m Arix. So... do you like Cupid and the others?\"\nAs soon as the words left her mouth, Arix worried she might have been too direct. She was about to apologize when she noticed that little Sylvana was actually blushing.\nArix thought to herself,\n’Whoa! It seems I may have just stumbled onto something big!’\nArix was a bit taken aback but realized it made sense.\nHer three little ones were so charming, it wasn’t surprising someone would be drawn to them. She relaxed and asked thoughtfully, \"Do you want me to bring Cupid and the others out to meet you?\"\nSylvana shook her head gently. \"Let’s meet them later. For now, we need to focus on saving your father.\"\nHearing this, Arix perked up, excitement in her voice, \"Do you have a way to save my dad?\"\nArix wasn’t entirely sure she could save Thaddeus, but Sylvana’s confidence gave her hope.\nThe more she thought about it, the more excited she became, her eyes sparkling as she looked at the gentle creature in front of her with a big smile.\nBut Sylvana shook her head again and said, \"It’s not me who will save him; it’s you.\"\nArix felt a bit confused, not fully grasping what Sylvana meant. She knew her own strengths and weaknesses, and if she could’ve saved her dad, she would have done it already.\n\"Don’t doubt yourself,\" Sylvana said with a warm smile. \"Even though I am Sylvana, I’m just a streak of her soul with memories. You are the one who truly holds Sylvana’s power now, so only you can save your father.\"\nArix felt a mix of understanding and confusion. But one thing was clear: she could save her dad!\n\"Okay, what do I need to do?\" Arix asked anxiously, glancing at Thaddeus, who lay barely breathing on the bed.\n\"Don’t worry, I’m here to help,\" Sylvana reassured her. Without delay, she began to act. She flapped her wings and floated up, a bright golden eblem appearing on her forehead. Sylvana then placed her paws on Arix’s head and pressed their foreheads together.\nThis familiar gesture made Arix blink, sparking a memory.\n’I’ve done something like this before? Is it about unlocking the genetic lock again?’\nSylvana, temporarily tuned into Arix’s thoughts through the contact, felt a wave of sympathy. She explained, \"Arix, even though you carry the power of a deity, you’re a new life created from the fusion of my and the tiger’s spirits. That’s why you haven’t naturally developed powers like other cubs. It’s also why you’ve forgotten how to use Sylvana’s abilities.\"\n\"Does that mean if I can use Sylvana’s power, I can save my dad?\" Arix asked, not feeling sad about the revelation. She never really thought of herself as a deity; she even often forgot she was the pure-blood heir of the Tiger clan.\nSeeing that Arix was handling the news well, Sylvana relaxed and nodded. \"Yes, Sylvana’s power can save your father. I’ll share all my memories with you. They might not be complete, but they’ll be enough to save him. I hope that’s okay.\"\n\"I don’t mind at all! Let’s hurry,\" Arix replied eagerly, her eyes on her father lying on the bed.\nSylvana chuckled at Arix’s enthusiasm. She then closed her eyes and began transferring her memories to Arix.\nUnlike the first time Arix encountered such a process, this one didn’t give her a headache. Instead, it felt soothing, almost like a gentle head massage.\nWhen it was done, Arix felt refreshed and ready.\nArix quickly moved to Thaddeus and placed her hands on him. Even with the incomplete memories, she knew exactly what to do. She glanced at Sylvana and nodded slightly.\nSylvana understood the cue and transformed into a stream of psychic energy, merging into Arix’s heart.\nSylvana’s power was housed within Arix’s heart, and Sylvana herself was the key to unlocking it.\nWith Sylvana in place, Arix closed her eyes and channeled the power from her heart throughout her body. A soft golden energy flowed from her hands, wrapping Thaddeus in a warm cocoon of light.\n\"Is this enough?\" Arix asked, looking anxiously at her father encased in the golden glow.\nSylvana reappeared and nodded confidently, \"Yes, it’s enough. Once he absorbs this energy, he’ll wake up.\"\nArix sighed in relief, finally feeling at ease. Her father was going to be okay.\nSuddenly, she remembered something. \"By the way, Sylvana, can my dad’s Psychic Incarnation be saved?\" Arix recalled someone mentioning that her father’s Psychic Incarnation was gone. Losing it was like losing a part of oneself; her father would be heartbroken.\nSylvana knew about the Psychic Incarnation. He had sacrificed himelf to protect Thaddeus, saving him from the insectoids when he fell into the abyss.\nUnfortunately, by the time Sylvana arrived, the two-tailed cat Incarnation had already been lost, consumed by the insectoids. She had barely managed to save Thaddeus in time.\nSylvana sighed and shook her head, looking regretful. \"I’m sorry, Arix. My memories are incomplete. If they were whole, reviving a small creature like a Psychic Incarnation wouldn’t be too difficult.\"\nArix took a deep breath and forced a smile. \"It’s okay. I’m just grateful that my dad is alive.\"\nEven as she spoke, a flicker of sadness crossed her face. She lowered her head, thinking about the loss of the Psychic Incarnation. She wondered if there was any way to revive it or possibly create a new one.\nBut no matter how much she thought about it, nothing came to mind. The idea itself seemed far-fetched—most people didn’t even know what a Psychic Incarnation was, and here she was, contemplating creating one.\nShe knew that if others heard her idea, they’d probably think she was out of her mind.\nFinally, Arix decided to set the thought aside for now and research it more thoroughly when she had time.\nRight now, there was something even more important that needed her attention.",

      "content": "Chapter 182: Vita and Sylvana\nArix had a sudden brainwave: what if she set up Sylvana with Cupid and his friends? The thought of Sylvana and Cupid together made her grin a little too mischievously.\n\"Sylvana, my dad’s safe now. How about checking out my psychic world and meeting Cupid and the others?\" Arix asked, a sly grin on her face.\nSylvana hesitated, clearly shy, but after a moment, she nodded.\nSeeing her agree, Arix was thrilled but worried she’d change her mind. \"Great! Jump in and have fun! I won’t bother you guys.\"\n\"Okay, thank you,\" Sylvana responded softly. She then transformed into psychic energy and entered Arix’s psychic world.\nEven though Arix promised not to interfere, she couldn’t help but sneak in after her.\nFortunately, her psychic world was vast enough for her to hide and observe without being noticed.\nInside, Vita was deep in medical books from the outside world, Sophia was engrossed in assembling a mecha model, and Cupid was wandering around, looking bored.\nCupid noticed Sylvana first.\n\"Who are you?\" Cupid asked, tilting his head, feeling oddly drawn to her but unsure if she was a threat.\nArix hadn’t expected Cupid to be the first to encounter Sylvana. Though Cupid was cute, he could be unpredictable. Worried Cupid might scare off their potential new friend, Arix subtly used her psychic powers to alert Vita and Sophia.\nVita and Sophia noticed Sylvana thanks to Arix’s hint and paused what they were doing. Sophia immediately activated her blue psychic power, forming a transparent cage around the newcomer.\nThis wasn’t how Arix had imagined things would go.\nEven Vita, usually so kind, stood back with a cold expression.\nArix’s heart raced, ready to jump in, but Sylvana effortlessly broke through Sophia’s psychic barrier. She sighed with relief and continued to watch.\nRealizing their attack had failed, Vita and Sophia exchanged nervous glances. They understood Sylvana was beyond their ability to handle.\nVita decided to try a more diplomatic approach and politely asked, \"Excuse me, who are you, and how can you get in here?\"\nSylvana didn’t say a word; she just gazed at the three kids with her beautiful green eyes, filled with a deep sadness.\nVita and Sophia were puzzled by her expression. Sophia, feeling guilty for her earlier harshness, huffed anxiously, \"Why are you sad? We’re not going to hurt you.\"\nHearing Sophia’s familiar, stubborn tone made Sylvana even sadder. Tears began to well up in her eyes.\nCupid, who had already taken a liking to Sylvana, became concerned seeing her on the verge of tears. He started circling her, gently nuzzling her and comforting her with a soft howl, \"Don’t be sad. They’re not bad guys; they won’t hurt you.\"\nHidden away, Arix felt a surge of pride for Cupid and silently gave him a thumbs up.\n’Cupid really was really a kind baby,’\nArix thought. She decided to reward him with a box of Insectoid Cores when they got back.\nSylvana, touched by Cupid’s kindness, managed a small smile.\nEncouraged by his support, she finally spoke, her voice soft, \"I’m Sylvana. I’m back.\"\nNo sooner had Sylvana spoken than Arix felt her psychic world tremble, as if experiencing an earthquake. She was stunned.\nThe tremors stopped quickly, and the psychic world stabilized.\nArix breathed a sigh of relief, but when she looked at Cupid and the others, she was utterly shocked.\nThe three little ones had disappeared, replaced by four young adults. Now, these young men and women were shyly sharing their feelings, with the red-haired young man—Cupid—clinging to the young woman, Sylvana, not wanting to let go.\nThe display of affection overwhelmed Arix, leaving her feeling a bit lost.\n’Where did my adorable, beautiful, well-behaved little ones go?’\nHer confusion was short-lived as she was suddenly lifted by a psychic power, landing in front of the group.\nThe blue-haired young woman, looking annoyed, asked, \"Arix? What were you doing hiding there?\"\nArix quickly realized this was Sophia, now in a more mature form. Even though she recognized her, she didn’t dare upset the often petty Sophia. She quickly put on a flattering smile, \"I was just checking on everyone.\"\nSophia rolled her eyes, clearly not buying her excuse, but she then ignored her.\nArix, unfazed by his attitude, looked at them with wide eyes, taking in their new appearances.\nThe other two young men were identical except for their hair colors, and there was another a graceful young woman, whom Arix guessed was Sylvana.\nThe red-haired young man, Cupid, beamed with pride and showed off to Arix, \"Arix, don’t you think we look better now?\"\nArix, staring at the four stunningly beautiful faces, nodded enthusiastically.\nVita, with his dark green hair, smiled and gently patted Arix’s head. His cheeks flushed slightly as he looked warmly at Sylvana, asking, \"Sylvana, doesn’t Arix look just like us?\"\nThat sounded strange to Arix because in her mind, she was like their mother. They should look like her, not she like them.\nSylvana was in a white dress. She looked at Arix with a warm expression. \"Of course, Arix is like us,\" she said gently. \"In a way, she’s our child.\"\nArix was stunned. \"Wow, I always thought of you all as my babies, but you see me as your kid?\"\nCupid’s eyes sparkled as he looked at Sylvana. \"So, Arix is our baby?\" he exclaimed with excitement.\nSophia smirked, lifting her chin. \"Too bad she’s not as smart as I am,\" she said with pride, but there was no disagreement from Cupid.\nArix felt a bit frustrated at first, but after a moment’s thought, she realized they weren’t wrong. In some ways, she really was a result of their love. She bit her lip and covered her face, trying to hide her mixed feelings.\nIn just one day, Arix suddenly found herself with two dads and two moms. But as time passed, she felt more at ease.\nDespite regaining their memories from ancient times, Cupid and the others remained the same.\nVita was still mature and composed, Sophia stayed proud and sharp-tongued, and Cupid kept his cheerful and playful nature.\nSylvana, though, felt like a new addition, more like a mother figure.\nArix enjoyed Sylvana’s gentle touch on her head and thought having another mom wasn’t so bad. It would be perfect if Sylvana could feel more like a sister, though.\nAfter spending some time together, Arix decided to leave.\nSylvana and Cupid had just reunited, and they probably wanted some time alone. Plus, Arix had her sick father to worry about.\nWhen Arix’s consciousness returned to her body, she opened her eyes and saw Thaddeus lying on the bed. The golden cocoon around him was thinning out, almost completely absorbed.\nShe used her psychic power to check Thaddeus’s condition. After confirming everything was fine, she sat down patiently to wait.\nIt wasn’t that she didn’t want to inform others, but the method she used for treatment was unconventional. It seemed easier to keep it a secret and come up with an excuse later than to explain it all now.\n...\nOutside the treatment room, Matis was fuming. He punched the wall, breaking off chunks of stone, which seemed to ease his anger a little.\nMarlone, seeing the damage, nervously patted Matis’ back. \"Let’s not worry about them right now. We can deal with it later,\" he said.\nZeta was also upset. He hadn’t expected the Empire’s Dragon clan to stoop so low.\nThey spread false rumors online about Admiral Thaddeus’s death and even paid influencers to get their fans to mourn him.\nSome people who initially doubted the news were convinced by the fake data, and now the entire Alliance was in chaos, especially the Fifth Legion’s territory, which was gripped by panic.\nIn the past, when the Dragon clan acted out of line, the Alliance typically opted for peace and only gave them a stern talking-to. But this time, they’d really crossed a line.\nThaddeus was a hero, and he didn’t deserve that.\nZeta quickly had the Alliance debunk the rumors. He gathered evidence of the Dragon clan’s false accusations, planning to present it to the Empire and demand some answers.\nIn the past, they didn’t have much sway in the Empire, but now the Alliance held the technology of the Arix Crystal, which gave them more leverage. While they couldn’t shut down supplies to the whole Empire, they could definitely make things hard for the Dragon clan.",

      "content": "Chapter 183: Saving Phantom\nBefore Zeta could take any action, an unexpected video call came from the Empire.\nOn the screen, Cassian, looking sharp in an elegant prince’s outfit, bowed slightly with a sincere expression. \"I’ve heard about the rumors. I apologize for the negative impact on Admiral Thaddeus. The Empire has already reprimanded the Dragon clan and asked them to issue a public apology. We hope this can help repair the harm caused to Admiral Thaddeus and his family. I apologize on behalf of the Empire.\"\nCassian then gave a formal Empire salute.\nhis heartfelt apology left Zeta and Matis a bit taken aback. They both wondered,\n’What’s the Empire’s angle here? Is it because of the Alliance’s control over the Arix Crystal?’\nWhatever the reason, Zeta and Matis decided to respect the gesture from the Crown Prince of the Empire.\nMatis smiled warmly and said, \"Since the misunderstanding has been cleared up, there’s no issue now. Also, on behalf of the Kering family, I thank you, Prince Cassian, for your assistance.\"\n\"Admiral Kering, you’re welcome. If there’s nothing else, I won’t take up more of your time. I also wish Admiral Thaddeus a speedy recovery,\" Cassian replied politely before ending the call.\nAs the screen went dark, Zeta raised an eyebrow and asked, \"Mr. Kering, what do you think the Empire is up to?\"\nMatis chuckled proudly, \"What’s the big mystery? Arix saved him, and now he’s helping us out. That’s all.\"\nHe was well aware of Arix’s good relationship with Cassian. Plus, the Empire had gifted the Aqualis Region to the Alliance, benefiting the Fifth Legion the most. Given all that, he couldn’t just turn against Cassian.\nThe Aqualis Region, while mostly uninhabited, was rich in mineral resources and had many planets suitable for human habitation.\nIn smaller countries, one region that big could be as vast as their entire territory.\nThe Empire was being incredibly generous to give it away, as nations usually had to pay a steep price in blood and effort to expand their territory against the insectoids.\nThe Alliance’s ancestors had sacrificed countless lives and generations of effort to secure one star system and establish the Alliance in the interstellar world. So, in a way, the Alliance got a fantastic deal.\nMatis knew that they should all thanks Arix. Without her, the Empire and the Alliance wouldn’t have achieved this peace, nor transitioned from enemies to allies.\nMatis grinned widely, feeling so proud of Arix.\nZeta noticed Matis’s proud expression and wisely chose not to burst his bubble. With a slight eye roll, he turned his attention back to the treatment room, curious about how Thaddeus was doing.\n...\nIn the treatment room, Arix was so exhausted she drifted off to sleep right next to the bed, oblivious to the rumors spreading on the interstellarnet.\nEven when Cassian tried to video call, the opticomputer, sensing its owner was asleep, automatically declined the call.\nArix was out cold after a day of battling and worrying about Thaddeus. She didn’t even notice when he woke up.\nAs the golden light around him dimmed, Thaddeus slowly opened his eyes. His first thought was to check his psychic world, but he couldn’t find the two-tailed cat.\nThaddeus froze, then it hit him—he had lost his little companion.\nThaddeus clenched his fists and bit his lip, tears of sorrow and despair streaming down his face.\n\"Phantom...\" he muttered.\nSuddenly, he coughed up a mouthful of blood. He covered his mouth with his hand and leaned back, coughing.\nThe blood that dripped onto Arix’s hand startled her awake. She looked up to see Thaddeus coughing up blood.\n\"Dad!\" Arix shouted, jumping up to check on him.\nAfter a quick examination, she realized he was coughing blood because his overwhelming sadness was causing his vital energy to flow backward. She knew he was feeling sad for losing his Psychic Incarnation.\nArix wondered if she should tell him the truth or try to comfort him with a little white lie.\nFor the first time, Arix felt uncertain about what to do.\nThaddeus noticed his daughter was awake and quickly wiped the blood from his mouth, not wanting to worry her. \"Arix, I’m fine,\" he said weakly, his face pale.\n\"Dad...\" Arix could see he wasn’t fine at all.\nSeeing him try to comfort her despite his own pain, she made a decision. It was better to offer him a sliver of hope than to leave him completely despondent.\nShe put on a cheerful smile and said playfully, \"I know you’re fine, Dad! I healed you, didn’t I? Aren’t you proud of me?\"\nShe hugged Thaddeus’s arm, trying to lighten the mood. Thaddeus forced a small smile and replied, \"Arix, you’re the best. Having you as my daughter is the proudest thing in my life.\"\n\"And you’re Worlds best dad!\" Arix said, rubbing her head against his arm with a proud grin.\nThaddeus, still pale, smiled and gently patted her head, silently agreeing.\nWhen the moment felt right, Arix acted like she suddenly remembered something. \"Dad, your body’s almost fully healed, but your Psychic Incarnation needs more time to recover. You won’t be able to see him for a while.\"\nThaddeus’s breath caught. He gripped the blanket tightly, his voice shaky as he asked, \"Arix, does that mean Phantom can still be saved?\"\n\"Yes, he can,\" Arix nodded firmly, looking him straight in the eyes to reassure him.\n\"Arix, are you sure? How could a Psychic Incarnation be saved?\" Thaddeus asked, his initial excitement giving way to skepticism. He knew Arix was talented, but reviving a vanished Psychic Incarnation seemed impossible, like something only a god could do.\nArix didn’t flinch when her lie was questioned. Instead, she pulled out her Talrin’s notebook and handed it to Thaddeus.\nThaddeus flipped through the pages, his eyes widening at the unconventional ideas within.\nNormally, he would have dismissed such theories as nonsense. But now, after losing Phantom, he clung to this glimmer of hope.\nHe turned to Arix with a mix of desperation and hope, \"Arix, is this real?\"\nArix nodded confidently. \"Yes, Dad, I promise you, I can bring Phantom back.\"\n\"Really... that’s incredible.\" Thaddeus tried to keep his voice steady, but a trace of emotion broke through.\nSeeing her father’s belief in the lie, Arix felt a pang of guilt. She knew she might be giving him false hope, but she decided it was worth it to keep him going. For now, she chose to be a \"bad kid\" who lies, just this once, for the sake of his health.\nWatching Thaddeus smile, genuinely uplifted, Arix felt a mix of relief and regret.\nRemembering the others waiting outside, she quickly mentioned, \"Dad, Grandpa and the others are outside. Should I let them in?\"\n\"Your grandpa’s here too? Arix, let them in! I’m feeling great now; I’m ready to take on the insectoids again!\" Thaddeus said, his spirits visibly lifted by the thought of Phantom’s potential return. Everything seemed brighter to him, and even his complexion looked better.\n\"Dad, even if you feel better, you still need to rest for a few days,\" Arix gently scolded.\n\"Alright, alright, I hear you,\" Thaddeus agreed, smiling warmly.\nWith her father’s approval, Arix went to open the door to the treatment room. As soon as she did, the group outside rushed in, eager to check on Thaddeus.\n\"My dad is fine now; you can see him,\" Arix assured them with a polite smile. The officers praised her, some giving her a thumbs-up as they entered the room.\nMatis, Thaddeus’s father, entered as well. After making sure his son was healthy and in good spirits, he stepped back out and pulled Arix aside.\n\"Arix, something seems off with your dad. Does he know about Phantom?\" Matis asked, concerned.\n\"Dad knows,\" Arix replied, her tone somber.\nThis puzzled Matis even more. \"If the Psychic Incarnation is gone, why isn’t he more affected?\" he questioned, his worry deepening.",

      "content": "Chapter 184: Being Selfish\nBefore Matis could even ask, Arix decided to come clean on her own.\n\"Grandpa, I lied to Dad. I told him I had a way to save Phantom,\" she admitted, her voice heavy with worry and guilt.\nArix had lied to her dad, who cared so deeply for her. The thought of him finding out and possibly hating her weighed heavily on her mind.\nHer eyelashes quivered with fear, and she trembled slightly, her shoulders shaking.\nMatis stayed silent for a long moment. Then he gently patted Arix’s head and said, \"Don’t worry. Even if your dad finds out the truth, he won’t blame you. And thank you for trying, Arix.\"\nArix looked up at Matis in disbelief, her voice small. \"Grandpa, he won’t blame me? But I lied to him.\"\n\"What would he blame you for? For being too considerate? For caring about him too much?\" Matis replied, his tone a bit rough. He ruffled her hair, his voice softening with concern. \"Arix, you don’t have to carry everything on your own. You’re still young.\"\nArix didn’t respond. She just hugged her grandfather tightly, burying her face in his embrace.\nThe way her shoulders shook made Matis feel deeply sad. Arix was often too kind, sometimes she might even hurt herself. He wished she could be a little more selfish and take better care of herself.\nMatis sighed quietly and gently patted Arix’s back, comforting her in silence.\nMeanwhile, the Alliance officers, after confirming Thaddeus was okay, left quickly. They knew there was still a lot to do.\nBefore leaving, Zeta granted Thaddeus some time off to recover.\nAfter comforting Arix, Matis waited until Thaddeus’ wife arrived before heading back to the regiment with Marlone.\nIn the hospital room, Arix stood by the bed, barely daring to breathe as she watched Fleur. She sat between two beds, holding each of the men’s ears.\n\"Wow, you two did such dangerous things without telling me. Let me tell you, if you don’t explain today’s events properly, you’re going to stay in these beds forever,\" Fleur said, her anger rising as she twisted Thaddeus’ ears harder.\n\"Ouch, ouch, honey, honey, I’m sorry. I’ll tell you next time,\" Thaddeus quickly apologized.\nFleur shot him a stern look but couldn’t be too harsh, given his injuries. She let out a small huff and released her grip.\nThaddeus sighed in relief and lay back quietly, not daring to speak. Seeing this, Drexel quickly covered his aching ear and pleaded, \"Mom, Mom, I’m sorry too. I won’t do it again.\"\n\"Okay, I forgive you,\" Fleur said, her expression neutral, though she still held his ear.\n\"Mom, you haven’t let go yet,\" Drexel cautiously pointed out.\n\"And why haven’t I let go, you know? Son, hand it over. I’ll save it for your future career, or family,\" Fleur said, her tone unexpectedly gentle.\nDrexel gasped, eyes wide with mock horror. \"Mom, can I just have the money and skip the future wife?\"\n\"No wife means you still have to hand it over. Boys with too much money tend to go astray. Be good, son; this is for your own good,\" Fleur said with a gentle, yet firm, tone.\nThaddeus nodded in agreement. \"Listen to your mother, son. I’ve always given my paycheck to her for safekeeping.\"\nDrexel gave his dad a disapproving look, thinking,\n’You’re just a henpecked husband.’\nBut seeing the increasingly stern look in Fleur’s eyes, he reluctantly transferred 10 billion astrocredits to her account.\nIn this family, aside from his grandfather, Drexel knew better than to cross Fleur.\n’Oh well, money is just an external thing. If it’s gone, I’ll just earn more,’\nhe consoled himself, clutching one corner of his clothes.\nSuddenly, Drexel remembered that Arix hadn’t handed over her money yet. He sat up and said to Fleur, \"Mom, Arix hasn’t given hers yet. It’s not safe for a young woman to have so much money. Maybe you should take care of it too.\"\nHe spoke with a righteous tone, then turned to Arix and added, \"Arix, don’t blame me for this. This is for your own good.\"\nFleur nodded in agreement. \"Your brother has a point.\"\nArix gave Drexel a disdainful look and was about to transfer her astrocredits to Fleur when Fleur stopped her.\n\"Arix, listen to your brother and always be careful. Just never let strangers know how much money you have. But even if you lose money, it’s okay. I will give you more,\" Fleur said lovingly, holding her daughter’s hand.\n\"Okay, Mom, I understand,\" Arix nodded obediently, then made a triumphant face at Drexel.\nDrexel looked utterly defeated.\nThat afternoon, after various medical tests confirmed Thaddeus was fine, the doctor cleared him for discharge.\nDrexel, already tired of the hospital, was eager to go home and play games on his Connective Pod. He didn’t want to waste such a beautiful weekend in the hospital.\nOnce home, Arix spent some time with Thaddeus and Fleur before heading to her room to study Psychic Incarnation. She searched the interstellarnet for information but found only fragmented bits. However, some internet users’ theories sparked ideas for her.\nArix carefully recorded these ideas and pondered their connections. Psychic Incarnation was exclusive to the five major families; ordinary people couldn’t possess it.\nAs to why it favored only these families, Arix was unsure. Based on speculative theories, she thought the answer might lie in the origins of the Alliance, which inevitably led back to ancient times and the ancestors of the five families.\n...\nFinding reliable information on the origin of the Alliance was a challenge, especially on the interstellarnet, where details were scarce.\nThe crucial information about the Psychic Incarnation remained mostly a mystery, likely because it was classified as a state secret.\nWith limited options, Arix decided to dive into her family’s library, hoping to uncover more about the Alliance’s beginnings.\nShe spent hours poring over old texts, her eyes growing tired from the effort.\nFinally, Arix paused, massaging her temples and closing her eyes to rest. She began to piece together the information she’d gathered.\nLegend has it that the Alliance’s ancestors hailed from a place called ancient Aristar.\nThis planet was torn apart by a world war triggered by trivial reasons. Only the Antura Federation, known for its formidable strength, stayed neutral during the conflict. The rest of the world, driven by self-interest or coercion, plunged into war.\nThe conflict dragged on for years. Then, the Kragos kingdom shattered the world treaty by deploying the first anti-matter bomb, ushering in an era of anti-matter warfare.\nThe devastation was immense, displacing countless animals and wreaking havoc on Aristar’s ecosystem, leading to the extinction of many species.\nAs the war continued, even Aristar’s atmosphere became compromised. What was once a protective barrier no longer shielded the planet.\nMeteors, which would have harmlessly burned up in the atmosphere, began crashing down, turning each meteor shower into a catastrophic event.\nThis marked the onset of a century-long disaster era for Aristar.\nDuring this time, the Antura Federation stood as the last bastion of civilization, having avoided the conflict from the beginning. The other nations were nearly obliterated, and their populations decimated without the protection of functioning governments.\nAmid this chaos, a surprising event occurred within the Antura Federation.\nIn a mental hospital, five patients with split personalities experienced a sudden awakening of their main personalities. Their other personalities transformed into what became known as the Psychic Incarnation, each with its own consciousness.\nRemarkably, one of these incarnations had the unique ability to design spaceships.\nThese five individuals, once dismissed and overlooked, began using their newfound abilities to lead the remnants of ancient Aristar.\nThey became the legendary five heroes of the Alliance, credited with saving their people.\nTogether with the survivors, they escaped the dying planet in spaceships, eventually stumbling into a new interstellar era.\nThey landed in the territory of the Empire of Sacred Moonlight, the most powerful nation at that time. Instead of seeing them as invaders, the Empire treated these refugees with compassion, granting them a place to settle on a distant planet.\nLittle did the Empire of Sacred Moonlight know that their act of kindness would eventually create their biggest competitor.",

      "content": "Chapter 185: Meeting Talrin\nAfter finding refuge, the people of ancient Aristar began to awaken their psychic powers. They established a small nation known as the Alliance.\nAt first, this tiny planet-sized country wasn’t seen as much of a threat, akin to a small village in comparison to a vast empire.\nSurprisingly, the Alliance, under the leadership of the five former mental patients, gradually became a force to be reckoned with, rivaling the might of the Empire of Sacred Moonlight.\nThis rapid rise alarmed the Empire, especially its warmongers, who viewed the Alliance as a thorn in their side. They accused the Alliance of growing strong by leeching off the Empire’s resources.\nOn the flip side, the Alliance felt wrongly accused. They insisted that their growth was the result of their own hard work, battling Celesterrors and insectoids to expand their territory bit by bit. They even pointed out that they had returned the planet they initially borrowed, arguing that the Empire had no grounds to complain.\nThese conflicting views led to a complete breakdown in relations between the two powerful nations.\nWhile they avoided major wars, smaller skirmishes were common. The only thing preventing an all-out war was the ongoing threat from the insectoids, who constantly attacked the Empire, and the lingering gratitude the Alliance felt for the Empire’s initial kindness.\nAs Arix pondered all this, she began to delve deeper into the nature of the Psychic Incarnation.\nShe speculated that perhaps the Psychic Incarnation wasn’t a separate entity but rather a part of the host, existing independently yet still connected.\nMuch like how people speculate about past lives, perhaps these incarnations were manifestations of previous existences. One’s past life could have been anything from a horse to a plant or even a fish.\nWhile this idea was intriguing, it remained a theory for now. Proving it would require extensive research and time, much like how humanity understood the concept of flying long before they could build airplanes.\nFeeling the strain of the day, Arix rubbed her temples in fatigue. She realized she needed to talk to Talrin, the current president of the new Psychic Ware Association, who had inspired many of her thoughts through his notes.\nLooking out the window, Arix noticed the moon was already high in the sky. It was too late to visit Talrin now, so she decided to head to the Psychic Ware Association first thing in the morning.\nAfter organizing her notes, she yawned and lay down on her bed, quickly drifting into a deep sleep.\n...\nThe next morning, after enjoying breakfast with her parents, Arix set off from the Kering family home alone. She used her opticomputer to navigate to the address of the new Psychic Ware Association, finding herself in Mulado’s most infamous slum.\nLooking around at the grimy, chaotic streets, she double-checked the address, uncertain if she was in the right place.\nIt seemed strange to find a Psychic Ware Association in such a rundown area.\nDespite her confusion, she frowned slightly and ventured into a narrow alley.\nArix soon reached a building that looked even more decrepit than the ones she’d seen in Planet Waste. She stared at the dilapidated structure, appearing on the verge of collapse, her mouth twitching in disbelief.\nDouble-checking the signboard to confirm the location, she saw the words \"New Psychic Ware Association\" painted in large, faded letters.\nSighing, Arix placed her hand on her forehead, feeling a bit uneasy, and approached the door. She knocked gently, but to her surprise, the door fell right off its hinges.\nShe stood there, stunned.\n’I swear I didn’t use that much force...’\nshe thought to herself.\nJust as she was about to leave, a voice called out from inside.\n\"Arix, is that you? Since you’re here, why not come in and have a seat?\" It was Talrin, sitting in the hall and sipping tea. He had recognized her right away.\nArix hesitated briefly before stepping inside. The hall was surprisingly clean and organized, not nearly as dusty or cobweb-filled as she’d imagined.\nRelieved, she sat on an old sofa across from Talrin, greeting him politely, \"Talrin.\"\nTalrin, a young man in his early thirties with refined and gentle features, had an air of scholarly elegance. He wore a monocle and greeted Arix with a warm smile.\n\"You must be thirsty after your journey. Have some tea,\" Talrin offered, pouring another cup and placing it in front of her.\nArix took a sip without much thought, but her smile quickly froze. She glanced at the leaves in her cup in disbelief.\n’Are these... actual grass leaves? He’s making tea with grass? It must’ve been a very tough time for him. Has he fallen so low that he can’t afford real tea?’\nSwallowing the bitter brew, she set the cup down and forced a smile. \"Talrin, I came to see you today because I need your help with something.\"\nTalrin, with a knowing smile, responded, \"No need to explain. I know you’re here for the complete notes, right?\"\nArix lowered her gaze, realizing Talrin must have anticipated her visit. The notes he had given her weren’t just a random gift; they were more like bait, a clever lure. It dawned on her that Talrin had likely planned this all along, knowing she’d be curious enough to seek him out.\nWith a small smile, Arix thought to herself that she was like a fish being lured in by a clever trap, but at least Talrin was thoughtful enough to make it tempting.\nArix grasped the situation and didn’t feel upset. Instead, she smiled warmly at Talrin and said, \"To be honest, Talrin, I do need your notes, and I might also need your help.\"\nTalrin raised an eyebrow, not responding immediately. Instead, he asked, \"Can I ask why you need these notes, Arix?\" His tone was serious, making it clear he wanted a good reason before he handed over anything.\nWithout holding back, Arix explained everything about her father’s situation to Talrin.\n\"That’s the whole story. I hope you can lend me the notes, Talrin. If you have any conditions, just let me know, and I’ll do my best to meet them,\" Arix said sincerely, with no pretense in her voice.\nAfter listening, Talrin smiled. He had thought his ideas were out there, but Arix’s plans were even more ambitious.\n\"Arix, I’m afraid my notes might not help you much,\" Talrin tried to gently discourage her. Reviving a Psychic Incarnation was far more complex than just creating one. The idea seemed almost impossible, even to him.\n\"I get that, but how will we know if we don’t try? Haven’t you been working on this for years, Talrin?\" Arix said quietly, looking at him with a determined smile.\nTalrin’s calm demeanor finally cracked. He looked at Arix intensely, almost like a predator ready to pounce. But Arix stayed composed, meeting his gaze head-on.\nAfter a moment, Talrin suddenly laughed. \"Alright! You really are something, Arix. If you want the notes, I’ll give them to you, but you must agree to three conditions.\"\n\"Go ahead, Talrin,\" Arix responded, her smile widening as she felt a spark of hope.\n\"First, as you know, I’ve been researching Psychic Incarnations for years. Unfortunately, I don’t have one myself, so I can’t fully grasp the experience. My first condition is that I want to be involved in your research,\" Talrin said seriously.\n\"Of course,\" Arix agreed without hesitation. It was a reasonable request, and she saw no reason to refuse.\n\"The second condition is that I want my name on the patent of any final product. You know I run the New Psychic Ware Association, and it needs some credibility to attract members. Otherwise, it’ll stay as broke as it is now,\" Talrin admitted, sounding a bit embarrassed about the state of his association.\nArix glanced at the door still lying on the floor and nodded. She kindly offered, \"Do you need some astrocredit, Talrin?\"\n\"Thank you, Arix, but teaching a man to fish is better than giving him a fish. Just having a way to earn is enough for me,\" Talrin said, his gaze softening as he declined her offer.\nArix respected his decision and asked, \"And the third condition?\"",

I could make you the vice president, or even the president,\" Talrin said, looking hopeful.\nArix, a rising star in the Psychic Ware field, could bring a lot of attention and credibility to the new association. It would be like getting a celebrity endorsement, giving the group a big boost in recognition and influence.\nBut Arix hesitated before replying, \"I’m sorry, Talrin. There are some things I can’t decide on my own. Do you need anything else?\"\nTalrin paused, then apologized, \"I’m sorry, Arix. I forgot your last name is Kering. There are things you can’t decide on your own.\"\nHe found a perfect opportunity but not being able to take it. Talrin sighed deeply as he looked at Arix.\nArix felt a little awkward under his gaze, but she knew she couldn’t agree to that condition. Even though she wasn’t the only heir of the Kering family, her future, and the path she would take, had already been set.\nIf Arix accepted this condition, the Kering family elders might show up the next day with billions astrocredits to get Talrin to back off.\n\"Talrin, I’ve recently come into some money. How about I give it to you as the third condition?\" Arix offered, placing a card with ten billion astrocredits on the table.\nTalrin frowned slightly. Although he was struggling financially, he wasn’t the type to just take money like that. He pushed the card back and said, \"Arix, some things can’t be bought with money.\"\nSensing Talrin’s displeasure, Arix realized her offer might have been insulting. Not everyone thought money could solve everything, like Drexel did.\n\"I’m sorry, Talrin. It was rude of me to offer ten billion astrocredits,\" Arix apologized, reaching to take the card back.\nBut then, Talrin quickly grabbed the card. Arix blinked in surprise, looking at him with wide, puzzled eyes. Wasn’t he just refusing?\nFeeling a bit embarrassed, Talrin coughed and said, \"I thought about it. Since you can’t meet my third condition, I’ll accept the card as the third condition.\"\n\"Okay, thank you, Talrin,\" Arix agreed, still a bit confused but relieved.\nAfter they settled the matter, Arix took the half-meter tall stack of notes from Talrin. She stored them in her Space Button, and waved happily as she left.\nTalrin smiled as he watched her go. He stood in the doorway, which was missing a door.\nOnce Arix was out of sight, Talrin pulled out the card, rubbing it a few times, feeling quite pleased. He had thought the card might contain, at most, ten million astrocredits.\nThough he was struggling financially, he still had his pride.\nBut when he found out that the card held one billion astrocredits, his pride quickly took a back seat.\nIt only took Talrin three seconds to let go of his pride, and then he looked at the card with happiness, thinking,\n’Wow, kids from big families really do have a lot of money.’\nAfter admiring the card, Talrin excitedly shared the news in a group chat.\nTalrin: \"Guess what, everyone? Arix came by today and gave me a card. Any guesses on how much it’s for?\"\nJorvik: \"? Why did Arix give you money?\"\nLorin: \"How much?\"\nBryndel: \"You fool! Just give Arix whatever she wants. Why are you taking money from her?\"\nTalrin: \"She wanted my notes on Psychic Incarnation. I didn’t plan to charge her, but she offered so much, I couldn’t say no.\"\nTalrin: \"Oh, by the way, it’s one billion astrocredits.\"\nJorvik: \"... WTF, dude! Share the wealth!\"\nLorin: \"One billion?!\"\nBryndel: \"Talrin, my wardrobe needs an upgrade. You know what to do.\"\nTalrin rolled his eyes and quickly sent another message.\nTalrin: \"The signal’s getting bad. Gotta go, bye!\"\nJorvik: \"Always vanishes when money comes up! Disgraceful.\"\nBryndel: \"Speaking of which, Talrin, when are you paying back the fines you owe?\"\nJorvik: \"Master, the signal’s bad in the Merman clan. We’ll catch up later!\"\nLorin: \"Master, you know I’m broke.\"\nBryndel: \"Not talking to you, you poor fool. You haven’t even seen a proper heist. You’re a disgrace to space pirates.\"\nLorin: \"The kids are starving. Master, could you lend me a bit more? Promise I’ll pay you back.\"\nBryndel: \"Your credit is overdrawn, sorry.\"\nDespite his grumbling, Bryndel still transferred 50 million astrocredits.\nLorin: \"Thanks, Master. Love you!\"\nBryndel: \"You’re all a bunch of ingrates. Only the youngest one behaves.\"\nLorin: \"By the way, should we invite Arix into the group?\"\nBryndel: \"Let’s wait on that. Considering your current statuses—one a traitor to the Alliance, another a wanted space pirate—even if Arix agrees, I can’t risk it.\"\nLorin: \"True. Jorvik’s still undercover in the Merman clan. We can’t endanger Arix.\"\nBryndel: \"Sigh, taking you all in as apprentices has been exhausting. I’m done talking. Remember to delete the chat history. Goodbye.\"\nLorin: \"Understood.\"\nJorvik: \"Understood.\"\nTalrin: \"Understood.\"\n...\nArix left the New Psychic Ware Association and went straight to the Kering family home. She locked herself in her room and stayed up all night going through her Psychic Incarnation notes.\nThe next morning, she showed up at breakfast with noticeable dark circles under her eyes.\n\"Morning, Dad, Mom, Drexel,\" Arix greeted everyone and took her seat.\nThaddeus and Fleur smiled warmly at their daughter.\n\"Whoa, Arix, what did you do last night? You look like you haven’t slept,\" Drexel joked. He had stayed up late gaming too but didn’t look nearly as rough as Arix.\nHe even pulled out a small mirror to check his own face. Arix ignored his vanity and started eating her breakfast.\nFleur shot Drexel a disapproving glance and shook her head slightly.\n\"Arix, didn’t you sleep well last night?\" Thaddeus asked, concerned.\nArix didn’t want them to worry, so she shook her head. \"It’s nothing, I just stayed up too late studying.\"\n\"Studying is important, but your health comes first. Don’t do that again,\" Fleur said, giving her daughter a concerned look.\n\"Okay, Mom,\" Arix replied softly.\nSeeing Arix so tired, Fleur felt both concerned and a bit disapproving. \"Maybe you should take a day off today.\"\n\"No, I can’t miss classes at the military academy. I’d lose credits. I’m fine, Mom. I don’t have many classes this morning, so I can catch up on sleep,\" Arix reassured her with a smile.\n\"Alright, if you say so,\" Fleur sighed, patting Arix’s head affectionately.\n\"By the way, Dad, Mom, where’s Kellan? I haven’t seen Kellan around lately,\" Arix asked, changing the subject but also genuinely curious about her brother’s absence.\n\"He’s on a mission. Something to do with your school, I think,\" Fleur hinted, not elaborating further.\nThe mention of a mission made Arix uneasy, remembering the last one that ended with someone getting hurt.\nThen she realized that if it involved the school, it probably wouldn’t be too dangerous.\nShe just nodded and didn’t ask more questions.\nAfter breakfast, Arix hugged Thaddeus and Fleur before heading back to school with Drexel.\nOnce they swiped their ID cards at the school’s entrance, Arix headed straight to her room.\n\"Welcome home, Master,\" PO’s cheerful voice greeted her, though it sounded a bit glitchy.\nNoticing the glitch, Arix looked over, only to be shocked and angry. PO was in terrible shape, with parts missing and scratches and bite marks everywhere.\n\"PO, what happened to you?\" Arix asked, both angry and worried, inspecting him for damage.\nPO’s screen showed a flicker of emotion in his virtual eyes before dimming again. \"I’m sorry, Master,\" he said sadly.\nHe felt guilty for not protecting Admiral Thaddeus properly, even though he was fine now.\nThe more PO thought about it, the worse he felt, lowering his mechanical head in shame.\nBut Arix had no idea what PO was talking about. She looked at him, puzzled, and asked, \"Why are you apologizing? PO, tell me who did this to you, and I’ll go beat them up!\"\nHer icy blue eyes flared with a suppressed anger.",

      "content": "Chapter 187: Fixing Po\nPO seemed unsure how to respond. He shook his head and replied, \"It’s nothing, Master. They’ve already been punished.\"\nThe insectoids that attacked them had been blasted to pieces by the super electromagnetic cannon, so they had indeed faced consequences.\nFrustrated that PO wouldn’t elaborate, Arix lightly knocked on his head. Then she took his hand and headed toward the mecha room.\n\"Master, where are we going?\" PO asked curiously, following Arix without resistance.\n\"Of course, to fix you up! Look at you; you’re in such a state. We can’t leave you like this,\" Arix said, quickening her pace as she looked at all the damage on PO. The cuts and scrapes were too glaring to ignore; they needed to be addressed immediately.\nPO’s fingers trembled as he looked at Arix in surprise. He lowered his head, touched by her concern.\nNo one had ever treated him with such care before. Most people saw him just as a weapon, keeping their distance and hiding their fear behind a mask of respect.\nNo one ever thought that a level-eight mecha could have thoughts, a soul, or feel loneliness.\n\"Thank you, Master,\" PO thought, watching Arix quietly, the corners of his mouth on the screen lifting slightly.\nIn the mecha room, Arix had PO lie on the repair table and brought a basin of water. She wet a towel and gently cleaned PO’s body.\nAfter finishing, she looked up at PO and asked, \"I’m going to start repairing your body now, PO. Do you want to stay awake, or should I put you in standby mode?\"\n\"Can I stay awake?\" PO asked carefully. He wanted to remember this moment because it felt special, like a moment of true happiness.\n\"Sure,\" Arix replied, patting PO’s head affectionately. She then took out the mecha repair kit from her Space Button and began checking and dismantling the damaged parts.\nAs Arix opened PO’s outer shell, her eyes flickered for a moment. Though she didn’t show any signs of surprise and continued with the repairs, a question lingered in her mind: Is PO really just an ordinary robot?\nThe components and materials inside were of Supergiant-Class quality, and some of the materials were even unfamiliar to her. Moreover, PO’s internal structure seemed to follow the standards for a mecha.\nThough she felt curious, Arix didn’t want to pry into PO’s secrets, even if he was just a robot.\nTime passed as Arix worked diligently, and after screwing in the last piece, she finally breathed a sigh of relief. She straightened her back and rubbed her slightly numb wrists.\n\"PO, get up and see if there’s anything else wrong,\" Arix said, a smile in her voice.\n\"Okay, Master.\" The newly fixed PO stood up obediently, moving its limbs to check everything was working right.\nWith a look of surprise, PO glanced at Arix and smiled, \"Master, I’m all good now.\"\n\"That’s great, really great,\" Arix replied, her smile masking the fact she felt like crying inside. She hadn’t planned on using nearly all her mecha materials from her Space Button just to fix a butler robot.\nArix couldn’t help but wonder if PO was actually a prototype for a Supergiant-Class mecha created by some grandmaster. It seemed like a cost-saving move to put PO in as a school butler; otherwise, why would a butler bot need weapons and high-end materials for his joints?\nThe more she thought about it, the more convinced she became. Although her Space Button stash was pretty much drained, there was a silver lining. Even if PO was only a half-completed project, it still held some impressive mecha tech.\nWhile Arix didn’t quite get the mechanics of it all yet, she’d noted down the key parts. Given time, she figured she could learn a lot about mecha manufacturing.\nSo, she told herself the materials she used were like paying tuition for a valuable lesson.\n\"Thank you, Master! You’ve really worked hard,\" PO said sweetly, looking up at her. Seeing PO so cute and obedient, Arix felt like it was all worth it.\n\"It’s okay, thank you for looking after me,\" Arix responded warmly, patting PO’s head.\n\"Taking care of you is my duty. But Master, there’s a class at 2 PM. You should get some rest before then,\" PO suggested, noticing she seemed tired.\nArix yawned, feeling the exhaustion set in. \"Alright, I’ll take a nap now. PO, please make some lunch for me. I’ll eat when I wake up.\"\n\"Yes, Master.\" PO nodded and watched as Arix headed to her room. Then it took an apron from its storage compartment and put it on, ready to start cooking.\nWhile preparing the meal, PO received a video call from Gunder, the president of Hecaris Military Academy.\nPO set down the knife and pressed a button on his arm, bringing up a screen.\nAs soon as Gunder appeared, he saw the level-eight mecha wearing an apron. His eyebrow twitched in confusion, and he asked with a complicated expression, \"Shadow Blade, are you cooking?\"\n\"What’s up?\" PO responded calmly, a slight irritation in his tone. He didn’t like being interrupted while preparing food for his master.\nGunder, sensing PO wasn’t in the mood for small talk, shrugged and said, \"The Fifth Legion asked me to help you with repairs. When can you come to my office?\"\n\"No need, Arix already took care of it,\" PO replied, his eyes softening at the mention of Arix.\n\"Really?\" Gunder was taken aback. \"You’re saying that girl from the Kering family fixed you?\"\n\"Yes, my master,\" PO said proudly, holding his head a little higher.\n\"That’s impressive, I didn’t expect her to be so skilled. But the materials provided by the military are even better. Do you want to come and replace them?\" Gunder asked, holding up a silver Space Button and looking at PO on the screen.\nPO hesitated briefly before shaking his head. \"No need, the materials my master used are also very good.\"\n\"Alright, I’ll keep them for you. If you ever want to switch, just let me know,\" Gunder said, not pressing further. A level-eight mecha rarely gets into combat situations, so as long as it functions properly, there’s no urgent need for upgrades.\n\"Okay,\" PO nodded, his tone indifferent. Then, after a pause, he asked, \"Is Drexel the official heir of the Kering family?\"\nGunder, a bit surprised by the question, nodded truthfully, \"Yes, he is.\"\nPO was silent for a moment, then asked, \"Can the heir be changed?\" He knew he was being unreasonable, but he hoped Arix could be the heiress. That way, she would officially be the master of the level-eight mecha and his true master.\nGunder, puzzled by the line of questioning, shook his head firmly. \"No, it can’t be changed. In the five families, only one person per generation can have a Psychic Incarnation, and Drexel is the only one in the Kering family this generation.\"\n\"But...\" PO wanted to say more but stopped himself. He knew Arix had a Psychic Incarnation, but outsiders didn’t know, and Arix preferred to keep it that way.\nFinally, PO said, \"Thank you, I understand.\"\nGunder had a sense of what might be going on. There had been similar situations before where a family’s level-eight mecha didn’t want to partner with the designated heir.\nIn those cases, the Administration Bureau would sometimes intervene, forcibly pairing the mecha with the heir for the safety of the Alliance.\nGunder disliked such forced arrangements, knowing it was a tough pill for the mechas and their creators to swallow.\nIf there ever came a day when everyone could have a Psychic Incarnation, perhaps level-eight mechas could choose partners they truly wanted within their families. But that dream seemed far off.\nGunder sighed deeply and tried to console PO, \"Drexel is actually quite excellent and kind. He would make a good partner.\"\nPO, feeling both disdain and sadness, replied, \"I know, he’s excellent. But there’s someone even better.\"\nThinking of Arix, who was gentle, kind, and strong, PO felt a wave of sadness. It wasn’t that Drexel wasn’t good; it’s just that PO already had someone special in mind.\n\"Well, there’s no point in dwelling on it. Your partner can only be the heir of the Kering family,\" Gunder said bluntly, hoping to set realistic expectations to avoid greater disappointment later.\nAfter a moment of silence, PO seemed to come to terms with the situation. \"I understand, thank you, Master Gunder. If there’s nothing else, I’ll hang up now.\"\nAfter ending the call, PO returned to chopping vegetables, his expression solemn. The occasional sigh revealed his true feelings: he was far from happy.",

      "content": "Chapter 188: A New Mentor\nThere were still thirty minutes until class started. PO stood outside Arix’s bedroom and gently knocked on the door.\nWith a soft voice, he said, \"Master, it’s almost time. You can get up and have lunch now.\"\nHearing the voice, Arix woke up quickly. She sat up in bed, still sleepy, and yawned, \"I know.\"\nAfter a while, Arix came out of the bedroom, washed up and wearing her combat uniform, still a bit drowsy.\n\"Master, you look great in your combat uniform,\" PO complimented sweetly, looking at Arix, who looked very spirited.\nArix looked down at her somewhat oversized combat uniform and couldn’t see what was so great about it. But she still patted PO’s head and smiled, \"Thank you.\"\nAfter finishing lunch, Arix said goodbye to PO and headed toward the Department of Combat building.\nJust as she stepped out of the house, she saw Drexel coming over with his friends and the Deanna siblings.\n\"Wow, Drexel, you weren’t lying! Your sister really lives in a house!\" Tevian exclaimed, his mouth open wide in surprise.\n\"I’m so jealous,\" Kael said, glancing enviously at Arix’s big house.\nThe Marceau siblings were also surprised but didn’t say anything.\nSeeing everyone’s envy, Drexel proudly boasted, \"Of course! She’s got the same genius genes in her.\"\nKael and Tevian both gave Drexel a disdainful look, as if to say, \"It’s not like you live here, so what’s there to be proud of?\"\nAfter that, Kael and the others turned their attention to Arix, who was chatting with Deanna.\n\"Arix, how does it feel to live alone in such a big house?\" Kael asked, holding out a pen as if it were a microphone.\nArix cheerfully gave a thumbs up and replied, \"Got to admit, it’s awesome!\"\nHer straightforward answer made everyone feel both envious and amused.\nAfter chatting for a while, they all walked together toward the Department of Combat building.\nThe department had different classes. The classes were ranked from S, A, B, C, to D, with D being the lowest and S being the best.\nThe students weren’t fixed in one class; students from lower classes could move up to better classes through hard work and end-of-term exams.\nStudents in Class S could be downgraded at any time. If they were downgraded, they went to Class A, and if they failed there, they went to Class B, and so on, down to Class D.\nIn Class S, where Arix and the others were, there were originally over 100 students at the beginning of the term, but now there were only about 90 left.\nThe higher the class, the fiercer the competition, and the tougher the training. Some students couldn’t handle the intensity of Class S training and voluntarily moved to lower classes.\nArix didn’t look down on those students. After all, some of them weren’t really interested in the Department of Combat in the first place. They just happened to score high on the entrance assessment and ended up in Class S.\nLike her former roommate, Lilou, who had the psychic power and physical power for Class S, but she was actually more interested in weapons research, so she voluntarily left Class S.\nArix and her friends soon arrived at the Department of Combat building. Once inside Class S, Arix and Deanna parted ways with Drexel and his group. The boys had their own group, and the girls had theirs.\nArix happily sat down next to Maya, pulling Deanna along with her. She exclaimed, \"Maya, you’ve moved up from Class A to Class S!\"\nMaya, with her usual bright smile, looked at Arix warmly and said, \"Yes, after drinking the potion you gave me, my abilities improved a lot. The teacher recommended me to Class S, and I have you to thank for that.\"\n\"I’m glad I can help. By the way, Maya, where’s Rei? I don’t see her,\" Arix asked curiously, remembering that Rei had similar physical power to Maya and should have also moved up to Class S.\nMaya explained, \"Rei might have to wait until next time. The teacher can only recommend one student per semester.\"\n\"I see,\" Arix nodded in understanding. Then she introduced the two, \"Maya, let me introduce you to Deanna, she’s my classmate in Class S. Deanna, this is Maya, my former roommate.\"\nMaya and Deanna politely nodded at each other and greeted. The three girls then started chatting about the training and everyday things, including some gossips.\nSpeaking of gossip, Arix excitedly said, \"Maya, I think I saw Calista and Dae-jung together the other day.\"\nMaya nodded, confirming, \"Yes, they’re together now. I even heard they’re engaged.\"\nArix gasped in surprise, \"No way! Aren’t they still studying? Isn’t it too early to get engaged?\"\n\"Engagement isn’t the same as marriage. It’s just about making things official, which can be reassuring,\" Maya explained.\nDeanna nodded in agreement, adding, \"It’s not that unusual. On Planet Void, people can get married as young as 16.\"\nArix was stunned. She didn’t know whether to think the interstellar era was too liberal or too traditional, with parents being so nonchalant about early marriage.\nSeeing Arix’s shocked reaction, Maya and Deanna exchanged a knowing look. They both silently confirmed something: Arix was definitely still single!\nAfter all, anyone who had experienced a crush or love would be eager to marry their partner.\nDeanna chuckled at her realization, and Maya joined in the laughter. Arix, however, pouted, feeling that there was something strange about their smiles.\nThe shared laughter helped break the ice between Maya and Deanna, making their conversation even more friendly. The three girls continued chatting and giggling together.\nFinally, the bell rang, signaling the start of class at the Department of Combat.\nAs the bell sounded, all the students sat down quietly, waiting for their mentor to arrive. Shortly after, a mentor walked into the classroom.\nHowever, this time, it wasn’t Arix’s uncle Marlone. Instead, it was a female mentor with a refined and commanding presence, dressed in a military uniform.\nThis sudden change in instructors left the Class S students speculating. Although Marlone was known for being strict and ruthless in training, the students couldn’t help worrying if anything had happened to him.\nArix felt a bit surprised but quickly figured out what was going on.\nIt seemed her dad being home on sick leave meant the Legion needed Marlone back earlier than expected.\nThe new mentor noticed the concerned looks on the students’ faces and didn’t beat around the bush. She wrote her name on the board and leaned against the desk, facing the class as she introduced herself.\n\"Marlone had to cut his leave short and return to the Legion for some reason. So, I’m your new mentor for this semester, Jonna. You can call me Mrs. Jonna,\" she said.\nThe students, relieved that Marlone wasn’t in any trouble but just called away for work, greeted her in unison, \"Hello, Mrs. Jonna!\"\nJonna nodded and continued, \"Today’s class is mecha practical training. Everyone, stand up and follow me to the training ground.\"\n\"Yes, ma’am,\" replied the students in Class S, getting up to follow her out of the classroom.\nThe training ground was located in the basement of the Department of Combat building. When they arrived, Jonna opened the door to a dimensional training room.\nUnlike the empty Dimensional Battlefield, this room was packed with all sorts of training obstacles and traps.\nThere were things like a mountain of ice, a sea of fire, and various other challenges.\nThe difficulty levels ranged from Basic to Hell, with the room Jonna selected being at the Basic level—just right for the freshmen.",

      "content": "Chapter 189: Competing With Drexel\nAfter guiding the students into the room, Jonna pulled out a long table from her Space Button, setting up dozens of bottles filled with colorful juices.\n\"Ma’am, what’s all this?\" one student asked curiously.\nArix glanced at the bottles, recognizing the contents by their colors and smells.\n’All mentors had their tricks!’\nArix thought to herself.\nWith a kind smile, Jonna explained, \"I used to be a top nutritionist. These juices are great for your health. Students who don’t pass the course can drink a cup to help them recover.\"\n\"She is so nice! I suddenly don’t miss Marlone anymore,\" one student exclaimed, feeling touched.\n\"She is awesome, giving us juice.\"\n\"The colors are so pretty, they must taste great too.\"\nJonna smiled but didn’t respond to the compliments.\nThen, she blew a whistle hanging around her neck, and once the students quieted down, she took on a more serious tone, \"Now, everyone, get in your mecha. You have to navigate five obstacles. If you can’t finish in 20 minutes, you’ll fail. If you take more than 40 minutes, you’ll be demoted to Class A. Now, get ready!\"\n\"Yes, ma’am!\" the students shouted back, each retrieving their mecha or renting one from the school.\nMost students at HMA came from Planet Waste and couldn’t afford their own mecha. Fortunately, those without could rent one from the school for about 100 astrocredits per use. Even though higher-level mecha cost more, it was still much cheaper than buying one.\nArix chose not to use her Supergiant-Class mecha, preferring to save her Star Dust for more critical situations than mecha training.\nBut Arix didn’t go for a rental mecha. Instead, she pulled out a prize she’d won during the entrance exam competition—a Comet Class mecha that had been sitting unused in her Space Button. As soon as she climbed into the cockpit, Arix noticed a clear difference between this one and her usual Star Dust mecha. The Comet Class was more complex to operate and not nearly as agile. Still, it would do for training.\nOnce everyone was ready, Jonna raised her hand and then dropped it sharply, shouting, \"Start!\"\nWith that, all the students charged ahead. Arix piloted her Comet Class mecha towards the first obstacle—a thousand-meter-long sand field. She noticed whirlpools in the sand, capable of trapping any mecha that stepped into them.\nMost students, realizing the danger, opted to fly rather than walk.\nArix took a moment to assess the situation, seeing no easy way around the whirlpools.\nShe followed suit, activating her mecha’s flight mode. However, just ten meters in the air, flashes of light suddenly appeared.\nGiant light blades sliced through the air toward the flying students, including several targeting Arix’s mecha.\nArix’s face tightened with concentration. She quickly tapped on the virtual keyboard, maneuvering the mecha through a series of tricky moves to dodge the blades.\nNot all the mechas were as fortunate; some were struck, while others, piloted by panicked students, fell into the sand. Then they were swallowed up and reappear at the starting point.\nHaving dodged the first wave of attacks, Arix felt a pang of sympathy for her classmates caught in the sand traps but kept moving forward.\nThanks to the training she’d had from Elio and her recent battles with insectoids, Arix’s mecha piloting skills had significantly improved.\nThis level-one difficulty course wasn’t too daunting for her, and she soon cleared the first obstacle, reaching the second: a two-kilometer obstacle course.\nThe course looked deceptively calm, making Arix more cautious.\nWith a name like \"obstacle course,\" it had to be hiding something tricky.\nShe swallowed hard and took a few tentative steps forward.\nEverything seemed fine, so she began to relax—only to be hit by a massive force in the lower back, sending her and her mecha flying through the air.\n’What the heck! A sneak attack? So unfair! No honor at all!’\nArix thought, cursing internally as she was hurled through the air.\nArix was on high alert, ready for the next trap.\nShe barely managed to twist her body and evade it just in time.\nBefore she could even catch her breath, the floor vanished beneath her feet. In a flash of panic, she made her mecha soar upward.\nNo time for relief, though—two massive wooden logs came swinging down from above. Arix reacted instantly, kicking them away with both feet and using the momentum to leap to safety.\nThe challenges kept coming: falling rocks, hidden snares, sharp blades, and more. But Arix pushed through and finally reached the end of the second level in one piece.\nIt was only in the safety zone that she allowed herself to relax a bit. She glanced around and noticed only a handful of her classmates had made it this far.\nThe biggest shock, though, was seeing Drexel already at the end of the third level. What seemed like brutal obstacles to everyone else looked like a walk in the park for him. He dodged every trap with such ease.\nArix felt a surge of determination and decided to skip resting. She quickly flew to the third level, an underwater tunnel.\nBefore diving in, she took a defensive stance, then passed through the light screen and cautiously entered the tunnel.\nWithin seconds, a sudden pressure dragged her to the seabed. Dizzy and disoriented, she opened her eyes only to find herself back at the starting point.\nArix: \"Darn it!\"\nWith a 12-minute countdown ticking on her wrist, Arix bit back her frustration. She raced through the earlier obstacles again and reached the third level once more.\nThis time, she switched tactics and activated her mecha’s shark mode.\nIn shark mode, her mecha neutralized the pressure, moving through the tunnel like a deep-sea creature.\nInvisible ice spikes tried to catch her off guard, but she dodged them with ease, thanks to her prep work. She soon passed through the light screen and emerged from the underwater tunnel, arriving at the fourth level: the gravity track.\nArix expected Drexel to have finished the fourth level by now, but he was only halfway through.\nThis gave Arix a boost of confidence, especially since the fourth level focused on psychic power—an area where she rarely lost.\nWithout hesitation, Arix enveloped her mecha in a psychic power shield and stepped into the fourth level.\nImmediately, a crushing gravity bore down on her. She increased her psychic power output, keeping the pressure manageable, and calmly walked to the finish line.\nArix completed the level with a confident smile. Psychic power tests were a breeze for her!\nIn the fourth level, Arix breezed past her fellow students, leaving them both amazed and a bit envious. It was like sipping an ice-cold soda on a winter day—refreshing yet a bit painful.\nWhile Arix could sense their envy, she kept her eyes on the prize: catching up to Drexel.\nAs she passed Deanna, Arix slowed down just long enough to give her an encouraging thumbs-up.\n\"Keep going, Deanna!\" she cheered.\nDeanna nodded and controlled her mecha to return the thumbs-up.\nWith a quick wave, Arix continued her race.\nArix overtook a few more students and finally caught up to Drexel.\nShe playfully wagged her finger at him, catching him off guard, before striding past him with her chin held high.\nDrexel wasn’t annoyed by her teasing; instead, he found her antics amusing.\nBut Drexel wasn’t going to make it easy for her. He narrowed his eyes and suddenly dropped the psychic power shield around his mecha. Relying on his physical strength, he surged ahead.\nArix was stunned for a moment but quickly regained her composure.\nShe wasn’t about to be outdone. She strengthened her psychic power shield and picked up speed.\nDrexel noticed her sudden burst of energy and smiled, pushing himself even harder.\nThe siblings raced side by side, nearing the exit together.\nBut then, Arix made her mecha fly, leveraging her strong psychic power to zip through the finish line light screen, winning by a narrow margin.\nDrexel was left just behind her, his impressive physical strength unable to match Arix’s psychic power, which allowed her to defy gravity and fly—a rare skill indeed.\n\"Nice job, Arix!\" Drexel called out, giving her a thumbs-up even though he had lost.\n\"Just okay,\" Arix replied with a cheeky grin. She then turned her gaze toward the fifth level.\nThe next challenge was a lava track.\nArix and Drexel exchanged a knowing glance before both took off, racing toward the entrance of the fifth level together!",

      "content": "Chapter 190: Chasing In Lava\nAs soon as Arix stepped onto the track, she felt like she’d been thrown into a furnace.\nInside her mecha’s cockpit, the heat seeped through. It was like being in a sauna, with the air itself burning hot.\nAhead of her, a sea of flames raged, with lava erupting and splashing everywhere. Arix swallowed hard and quickly activated her mecha’s energy shield, dodging stray lava bursts while keeping a close eye on Drexel in front of her.\nDrexel moved through the lava like he was born for it, handling the intense environment with surprising grace.\n’Man, he makes it look so easy,’\nArix thought, a mix of envy and admiration bubbling up. She tapped a few buttons, steering her mecha to leap over a sudden wave of molten rock.\nAs they progressed, the lava’s fury intensified, transforming from small streams into massive, fiery waves.\nEven Drexel began to struggle, his mecha’s energy shield draining quickly under the relentless heat. The energy gauge on his screen was dropping fast.\nDrexel was having a tough time, and Arix was really feeling the pressure. Her face flushed, breath heavy, sweat pouring down her skin—she felt like a Thanksgiving turkey.\n\"Arix, do you need help?\" Sylvana, her fluffy companion, perched on her shoulder. Her voice sounds full of concern. The extreme heat was so intense that even within Arix’s psychic world, Sylvana felt it.\n\"No, it’s just training. I’m okay,\" Arix insisted, shaking her head.\nShe knew if she relied on Sylvana now, it would defeat the purpose of the exercise. This was real combat training, and she had to push through it on her own to learn.\n\"Alright, but I’ll stay here with you. Call me if you need anything,\" Sylvana said, refusing to leave her alone in such harsh conditions.\n\"Thanks,\" Arix smiled, giving Sylvana a gentle pat before refocusing on her controls.\nIn the blazing, apocalyptic landscape, Arix and Drexel pushed their mechas to the limit, leaving trails intertwined and yet distinct.\nDespite their best efforts to dodge, some lava still struck their mechas, leaving marks for the test evaluation.\nBut there was a silver lining: the finish line was in sight.\nBoth Arix and Drexel noticed it and pushed their machines harder, racing toward the end.\nJust then, however, as Arix picked up speed, she failed to avoid a sudden burst of lava. It hit her cockpit directly, and the impact left her momentarily stunned.\nArix was engulfed in a wave of scorching heat, almost unbearable.\nDespite quickly using her psychic power to shield herself, the temperature around her was like being trapped in an oven. The intensity was too much, and Arix’s consciousness faded for a moment.\nIn that brief lapse, her Comet Class mecha lost its pilot’s control and began to plummet toward the lava below.\n\"Arix!\" Sylvana, glowing with golden light, sprang into action.\nAt the same moment, Drexel, having just turned back, saw Arix’s mecha descending dangerously close to the lava.\n\"Arix!\" Drexel’s heart skipped a beat. He was right on the brink of crossing the finish line but immediately turned around to save her.\nLuckily, they were close enough that he reached her just in time, grabbing her mecha and tossing it over the finish line with all his strength.\nAs Arix soared through the air, a whirlwind of emotions hit her. She felt guilty, like she was holding Drexel back, especially now when he could have won but instead came in second because of her.\nFor the first time, a deep urge to become stronger settled in her heart—not to surpass anyone, but to stop being a burden to Drexel.\nThis newfound resolve burned brightly within Arix as Drexel prepared to cross the finish line himself. But then, another cry for help rang out from behind.\nDrexel glanced back and saw another unfortunate classmate teetering on the brink of falling into the lava. He gave a casual thumbs-up as encouragement and then crossed the finish line without hesitation.\nThe unlucky guy was frustrated.\nFalling into the lava only meant a reset to the starting point; they’d learn and grow stronger from the experience, Drexel believed. But Arix was special; he cherished her deeply. He’d rather endure hardship themselves than let her suffer.\nFeeling pleased with his actions, Drexel cracked a smile. If the situation had been different, he might have taken a moment to admire himself in a mirror.\n’Today’s a good day to feel proud of myself,’ he smirked.\nAs Arix safely crossed the finish line, Sylvana finally felt relieved. Watching Drexel exit the lava track, Sylvana mused,\n’When there’s no real danger, Drexel can be a handful, but when there is, he’s the most reliable.’\n\"Yeah, he’s always there when it counts,\" Arix nodded, warmth spreading through her at the thought of Drexel’s concern.\nShe decided that once they got back, she’d find a way to show her appreciation for all he’d done.\nChapter 239 Magical Juice\n\"Arix, if there’s nothing else...\" Sylvana said as she said goodbye.\n\"Alright, Sylvana, see you later,\" Arix replied with a smile and a nod as Sylvana returned to the psychic world. Then, she opened the hatch and jumped out of the cockpit.\nArix reached for her Space Button, ready to store her mecha. Just then, someone handed her a glass of water.\n\"Thirsty? Have a drink,\" Jonna said kindly, smiling.\nArix was so parched that she didn’t notice who gave her the drink. She took the glass without looking and drank it down.\nImmediately, a strange taste hit her—numb, fishy, spicy, and bitter—all at once.\nShe felt like throwing up, but Jonna’s voice stopped her.\n\"This is my special nutritious juice made. Wasting it will cost you 10 credits and a thousand astrocredits,\" Jonna said, still smiling, but with a cold tone that made Arix shiver.\nArix felt hopeless. She closed her eyes and swallowed the juice.\nJonna finally smiled in satisfaction, patting Arix on the shoulder. \"Not bad. You’re the first one out. Keep up the good work.\"\nArix, still feeling queasy from the taste, looked at Jonna with a pitiful expression. \"Ma’am, why did I have to drink it just because I was the first out?\"\nJonna blinked innocently. \"I know, but you didn’t refuse, so I thought you liked it.\"\nArix was speechless. If Jonna weren’t her mentor, she would definitely argue with her.\n\"Okay, enough chatting, another one is coming out,\" Jonna said, nervously touching her nose and making an excuse to leave.\nArix watched as Jonna went off with the juice, offering it to other unsuspecting students one by one. The trick was the same, but surprisingly effective; nearly every student drank the juice without hesitation.\nAs she watched her classmates holding their throats, trying not to vomit, Arix wondered if the fifth challenge involved fire because Jonna wanted everyone to be thirsty so that they couldn’t resist the drink.\nShe clicked her tongue in amazement at Jonna’s cunning.\nWhen all the students were gathered, Jonna had managed to make the whole class miss their former mentor, Marlone.\nAlthough Marlone trained them harshly, he never did anything as sneaky as making them drink weird juice.\nThinking about the juice’s taste, all the students in Class S shivered.\n\"Arix, did you drink it too?\" a Class S student asked, looking hopeful.\nArix glanced at him, puzzled by the question. She nodded. \"Yes, I did. It didn’t taste good.\"\n\"Really! Got it, thanks, Arix,\" the student said, suddenly excited. He then went to chat with the others, looking like a wilted plant brought back to life.\nCurious, Arix watched him for a while and noticed that he seemed to be saying something to each student.\nAfter talking to him, each student also seemed to perk up.\nWondering what was going on, Arix decided to use her psychic power to secretly find out.",

      "content": "Chapter 191: Psychic Incarnation\n\"I’ve found something good about our new mentor,\" the Class S student said with relief. \"At least she’s not like Marlone, who had double standards. Even Arix had to drink the juice today.\"\n\"Really? That makes me feel so much better! Thanks for telling me,\" another student responded, their previously dull eyes lighting up with excitement.\nThe news spread quickly among the classmates, and the reaction was the same all around. Everyone went from feeling down to suddenly motivated and energized.\nSoon, the entire Class S had a new attitude. They stopped seeing Jonna as an intimidating figure and began to respect and even like her. They appreciated that she treated everyone equally, unlike Marlone, who had clear favorites.\nThose who had experienced Marlon’s favoritism felt a sense of relief. For example, even though Arix had the same achievements as the rest of the class, Marlone would only give others a simple \"Well done,\" while Arix got extensive praise, sometimes even involving compliments to her family.\nThis kind of favoritism left a deep sense of unfairness among the students. So, seeing Jonna’s fair treatment today made them feel it was worth it.\nThey decided that even if they had to drink strange juice every day, it was a small price to pay compared to dealing with Marlone’s favoritism.\nThat shocked Arix for a bit. But if that was what made everyone happy, she decided not to accept it and just see it as a good deed. She shook her head and turned her attention to Jonna, who was calling everyone to gather.\n\"I’m not satisfied with today’s training,\" Jonna began, her sharp gaze landing on five students who had their heads down. \"Especially those who took more than 40 minutes. There are five of you.\"\nThe rest of the students kept quiet, knowing that these five might be demoted to Class A.\n\"But,\" Jonna continued, pausing to get everyone’s attention, \"since it seems like you all enjoyed my juice, I’ll let it slide this time. But remember, there won’t be a next time.\"\nThe five students sighed in relief and thanked Jonna, while the rest of the class applauded, genuinely happy for them.\nThe training session ended on a positive note, and the new mentor, Jonna, had successfully integrated with the group.\nDespite the odd juice, all the students gave her positive reviews.\n...\nA month had passed. Besides attending her classes, Arix spent all her time researching her new Psychic Ware, which could help ordinary people form Psychic Incarnation.\nWith Talrin’s notes, Arix had a rough idea of how to proceed, but she felt like something was missing when carving the Psychic Ware. Without figuring this out, Arix was sure she couldn’t create the Psychic Ware she wanted.\nShe held the Insectoid Core in one hand and the carving tool in the other but hesitated. After thinking for a long time without any new ideas, Arix decided to seek help from the four experts in her psychic world.\nHearing Arix’s request, Sylvana brought Cupid and the others out. The four of them sat around the table. Cupid enthusiastically asked, \"Arix, is there a problem we can help you with?\"\nArix nodded, looking serious. \"I have a problem and need your advice.\"\nCupid smiled warmly and said, \"Arix, tell us, we’ll definitely help.\" Sylvana and the others nodded in agreement.\nSeeing everyone was willing to help, Arix thanked them and explained her problem. \"According to Talrin’s notes, to give someone a Psychic Incarnation, their psychic power must be completely condensed in the psychic world. This part is actually simple; the Psychic Ware can act as a medium. But the problem is, the Psychic Incarnation formed this way has no consciousness. It’s still just psychic power, only in a different form,\" Arix explained.\nThen she looked at Sylvana and the others, asking, \"What do you think?\"\nSylvana and the others lowered their heads, deep in thought.\nCupid wanted to contribute, but after thinking for a while, he just got more confused. He scratched his bright red hair. Unable to say anything, he finally looked at Sylvana with sad puppy eyes, clinging to her arm.\nSylvana smiled and patted his head comfortingly.\nVita and Sophia looked at Cupid with disdain.\nSophia then looked at Arix and said, \"You’re right, it’s still like psychic power. In other words, it’s just a materialized form of psychic power, not a true Psychic Incarnation.\"\nHearing Sophia’s words, Arix suddenly understood. It felt strange because this method was more like creating a psychic weapon.\nShe opened her palm and materialized a scalpel, then changed it to look like Cupid and the others. Everything looked the same but lacked the crucial element of life. The question was, how could she give it that life?\nAs Arix pondered, Sophia suddenly spoke up, \"I have an idea.\"\n\"What idea?!\" Arix’s eyes lit up with excitement as she looked at Sophia.\nSophia raised an eyebrow, smiling mischievously. \"The method is simple, but it might require Vita to sacrifice a bit.\"\nAs soon as she finished speaking, everyone turned to look at Vita.\nVita wasn’t as clever as Sophia, but Sophia had made it clear enough for him to understand.\n\"Do we really have to do this?\" Vita asked, feeling a bit resigned. Sophia smirked mischievously and said, \"This is the simplest method. Don’t you want to help Arix?\"\nArix also realized what was happening and felt a bit guilty and embarrassed, rubbing her nose. This method indeed required Vita to sacrifice a bit more.\n\"What exactly is this method? Why is everyone being so secretive?\" Cupid pouted, feeling left out as everyone else seemed to understand something he didn’t.\nSylvana, not wanting Cupid to be upset, whispered the method to him.\nAfter hearing it, Cupid rolled his eyes at Vita and said, \"So it’s just about making Vita Crystal? I thought it was something big. Vita, you’re being dramatic.\"\nVita rolled his eyes, thinking,\n’Of course, you wouldn’t understand; you’ve already got used to that process.’\nSince Cupid had already spilled the beans, Vita couldn’t stay silent any longer. Resigned, he said to Arix, \"I can provide Vita Crystal, but let’s be clear: I can only supply 300,000 pieces a month, no more.\"\nArix quickly nodded, worried that Vita might get too embarrassed and do something drastic.\nVita sighed in relief, then seemed to sink back into his thoughts.\nSophia chuckled quietly to herself before turning to Arix and saying, \"Now that we’ve solved the problem, let’s head back.\"\n\"Okay,\" Arix nodded, watching them return to the psychic world. She then turned to Vita, who was still sitting in the chair, and asked with concern, \"Vita, is there something else?\"\nVita blushed, then hesitated before stammering, \"Arix, if you want, I... I can make more Vita Crystal.\"\nArix was surprised for a moment, then she felt a warm and bittersweet sensation in her heart.\nShe walked over and hugged Vita, saying, \"300,000 is enough, thank you, Vita.\"\nVita hadn’t expected the hug, and after a brief pause, he gently patted her. \"No worries, I’m glad I can help you.\"\nArix’s smile deepened as Vita ruffled her hair. With Vita and the others around, she felt like she had a safe harbor—a sense of security, comfort, and belonging.",

      "content": "Chapter 192: New Contest\nVita hugged Arix for a while, then he took the Space Button loaded with Insectoid Cores back to the psychic world.\nAfter saying her goodbyes to Vita, Arix glanced at the time on her opticomputer.\nWith only thirty minutes left before the Department of Combat class started, she knew she had to hustle.\nRemembering the punishment for being late—downing a glass of juice—Arix quickly gathered her things and left her dorm.\nToday’s class was back at the dimensional training ground, but the difficulty had been bumped up to level two. Despite the increased challenge, everyone moved faster than ever, eager to avoid the dreaded juice penalty.\nBy the end of the session, Jonna reluctantly put away a large table covered with juice glasses.\nInstead of dismissing the class like usual, Jonna’s tone grew serious, \"I have an announcement. The new mecha tournament is set for six months from now. The Alliance’s national team will be selected from the five military academies, with six spots available per school. Final spots will be decided based on competition.\"\nJonna explained further, \"The selection process is straightforward: the top six students who can pass level-three difficulty at the training ground will be chosen. Anyone interested in competing, please raise your hand to sign up.\"\nExcitement buzzed through Class S.\nThe new mecha tournament was a huge event, with teams from all over the universe participating. A strong performance could mean better resources, while a poor one could spell trouble, especially for smaller countries.\nThe stakes were high—even for major powers like the Alliance and the Empire, showing weakness wasn’t an option.\n\"Ma’am, I’m signing up,\" Drexel declared. As the heir to one of Kering family and the top student in the Department of Combat, he felt it was his responsibility.\nJonna nodded and took a note on her opticomputer. Turning to the rest of the class, Jonna asked, \"Alright, Drexel’s in. Who’s next?\"\n\"Ma’am, count me in,\" Arix said, raising her hand.\n\"Okay, Arix is signed up too. Who else? Hurry up and sign up,\" Jonna urged, jotting down more names.\nAfter Drexel and Arix, other students eagerly crowded around Jonna to register.\nOnce everyone had signed up, Jonna gave a final reminder, \"Today is Friday. The competition kicks off next Monday at 8 AM. Don’t be late! And remember, it’s not just our class competing; other classes will be there too. Don’t embarrass us, or you’ll be stuck drinking juice every day!\"\nHearing Jonna’s clearly threatening words, the students swallowed nervously and shouted in unison, \"Understood, ma’am.\"\n\"Alright, you’re dismissed.\" Jonna smiled with satisfaction, then turned and left the training ground.\nAs soon as the teacher was gone, the students started chatting about weekend plans. Some wanted to stay and train at the school, while others were eager to meet friends outside.\nA few, who missed their parents, had already bolted off.\nAfter saying goodbye to his friends, Drexel approached Arix. \"Arix, are you heading home now?\"\n\"Yeah, but I need to stop by the dorm first to grab a few things,\" Arix replied. She had packed earlier, but in her rush to leave, she had forgotten some essentials.\n\"Okay, I’ll come with you to the dorm, and then we can head home together.\" Drexel seemed like he wanted to say something but was holding back.\nArix nodded, said her goodbyes to Deanna and the others, and then left with Drexel.\nAs they walked, Drexel couldn’t keep quiet any longer. \"Arix, the mecha tournament will be dangerous, are you sure you want to take part in it?\" His voice was full of concern and reluctance.\nDrexel hadn’t competed in the tournament before, but he had seen many broadcasts of past events. They were always intense and sometimes dangerous, with a 10% mortality rate among students, despite the organizers’ rules against killing. Those deaths were \"accidents,\" but that didn’t make them any less real.\nThe thought of Arix facing such dangers made Drexel’s heart sink.\nArix noticed his worry and felt a warm sense of gratitude. She reached out and held Drexel’s hand, speaking gently, \"You heard it too. Both you and I were pre-selected. Even if I hadn’t signed up, I would still have to compete.\"\n\"If you don’t want to participate, it’s okay. Plus, Mom and Dad would be so worried if you do,+\" Drexel said, his voice carrying a rare hint of authority as the family’s heir.\nArix was touched but shook her head. \"Some things can’t be avoided just because we don’t want them to happen. If I don’t go, someone else will. Wouldn’t they be in danger too? Wouldn’t their families worry?\"\nDrexel wanted to argue, but Arix continued, \"The main reason I want to participate is that I don’t want to be a spoiled kid who does nothing. I want to get stronger, strong enough to protect the people I care about,\" she said seriously.\nAfter speaking, she looked up at Drexel carefully, her eyes full of anticipation and nervousness.\nSeeing his sister’s determined expression, Drexel fell silent, feeling very conflicted. It was like watching a fledgling bird learning to fly—knowing it would be dangerous but understanding it had to happen.\n’If birds don’t learn to fly, they lose their surviving skills and can’t escape from danger,’\nDrexel pondered this and thought.\n’If I were her, would I do the same?’\nThe answer was a definite yes.\nHe let out a deep sigh and gently patted Arix’s head, saying, \"You’ve passed my test, but convincing Mom and Dad will be a whole different challenge.\"\nArix, reminded of this, felt her spirits sink like a deflated balloon.\nUnlike Drexel, Thaddeus and Fleur wouldn’t be as understanding. Young folks could get each other, but parents are always wary about their kids taking risks.\nArix suggested, \"Should we just keep it a secret like we did with the Dragon clan last time?\"\nDrexel shook his head gently, reminding her, \"Unfortunately, once you’re selected for the national mecha team, parents get notified. And with Mom and Dad’s influence, they could easily pull you out.\"\nArix frowned, \"Why can you join, but I can’t?\"\nDrexel smiled at her and patted her head again, explaining, \"Because I’m the heir to the Kering family and the future Fifth Legion Admiral of the Alliance. Once I graduate from Hecaris Military Academy, I’ll be a Rear Admiral. It’s like I’m already ’married’ to the Alliance, so I get some perks, right?\"\nArix felt torn. She should feel bad for him, but it almost sounded like he was showing off. After a moment, she shrugged and said, \"Whatever, we’ll deal with it later. Maybe Mom and Dad will agree.\"\nDrexel chuckled, \"Yeah, keep dreaming.\"\nArix pouted and, not wanting to argue, headed towards the house. As they reached the door, PO greeted Arix warmly. But when he saw Drexel, he seemed to show a brief look of disdain.\nSoon, PO quickly switched back to a polite smile for Arix, ignoring Drexel entirely.\nDrexel noticed this and rubbed his chin, thinking the robot was acting a bit strange, almost like he had emotions. He shook his head, dismissing the thought.\n’No way a robot could have feelings,’\nhe thought. Figuring it was just his illusion from being tired, he decided to unwind with some games on the interstellarnet later.\nWith that, Drexel pushed the thought aside and followed Arix into the house.\n\"Wait for me in the living room; I’ll be right back,\" Arix said to Drexel before heading upstairs.\n\"Sure,\" Drexel responded, grabbing an apple from the coffee table and lounging on the sofa, munching on it leisurely.\n\"Do you need any help, master?\" PO, the robot, asked Arix eagerly as she climbed the stairs.\n\"No need, I’m just grabbing something,\" Arix called back, disappearing at the top of the stairs.\n\"Okay...\" PO murmured, sounding a bit disappointed, and stayed behind in the living room, awkwardly facing Drexel.\nThis freew(e)bnovel.(c)om",

      "content": "Chapter 193: Discrimination\nDrexel, sprawled out on the sofa, looked bored as he chewed his apple. He eyed PO, remembering the last time he got in trouble for teasing the robot, so he decided to keep quiet and just watched him.\nPO noticed Drexel’s gaze and felt annoyed. He even thought that Drexel looking at him might somehow make him less clean. If he weren’t waiting to escort Arix out, PO would’ve left the room.\n\"Hey, why are you called PO? The name doesn’t sound that great. How about I give you a new one?\" Drexel suggested, trying to start a conversation.\nPO rolled its eyes, pretending to be a robot that didn’t understand Drexel’s words.\nIgnoring Drexel didn’t deter him, though. He continued, \"How about ’PP’ or ’OO’? Isn’t that better than PO?\" He looked quite proud of his suggestions, raising an eyebrow.\n\"Beep! Drexel, you have been deducted 5 points,\" an opticomputer announced suddenly.\n\"What? 5 points! That’s harsh,\" Drexel exclaimed, suddenly upset. Earning those 5 points required attending five classes and getting good evaluations. He’d worked hard for a month to accumulate just a few points.\nGrinding his teeth, Drexel fought the urge to swear. \"PO, don’t you think it’s unfair to deduct points without a good reason?\" he asked, forcing a polite smile even though he was fuming inside.\nPO glanced at him and replied in a cold, mechanical voice, \"You disrupted the campus assistant’s mental well-being by insulting him. Therefore, you lost 5 points as a penalty.\"\n\"Wait, you’re a robot! How can you have mental well-being?\" Drexel was stunned, staring in disbelief as he felt his worldview crumble.\n\"Beep! Drexel, you have been deducted 1 point,\" the opticomputer announced again.\nDrexel looked down at his opticomputer, watching his score drop from double digits to single digits. A cold wave of shock washed over him.\n\"Why did you deduct points this time?\" Drexel sounded like a young man being unfairly treated, his voice filled with frustration.\n\"You displayed discrimination towards a intelligent being, affecting his mental well-being,\" PO responded coldly.\nDrexel zipped his mouth in no time.\nDrexel and PO were staring each other down when Arix arrived with what they needed.\nArix looked confused and a little defensive as she saw how close Drexel was to PO. \"What are you doing?\" she asked, squinting like she thought Drexel was up to no good.\nDrexel felt a bit insulted by Arix’s protective stance. After all, he was the one feeling offended in this whole situation.\nJust as Drexel was about to say something, PO noticed the tension and hurried over, gently grabbing Arix’s hand. His screen displayed a sad face as PO said, \"Master, are you leaving now? Can I come with you?\"\nArix immediately shifted her focus to PO, hugging it and feeling a bit guilty. \"Sorry, PO. I asked the president, and unless there’s an emergency, I can’t take you out of the school. Please stay home for two days; I’ll be back soon.\"\n\"Okay, Master, come back soon,\" PO replied, trying to be brave despite his sadness as he let go of Arix.\nArix hugged PO tighter, feeling sorry for him.\nMeanwhile, Drexel stood off to the side, puzzled.\n’Why is the robot acting so emotional? Shouldn’t I be the one feeling upset?’\nFor the first time, Drexel felt genuinely confused by the situation. After comforting PO, Arix and Drexel finally left. Once they were out of sight, Drexel turned serious and said, \"Arix, there’s something odd about PO. I think he might have his own consciousness.\"\nArix laughed, clearly not buying it. \"You’re overthinking! There’s no way a robot like that could be conscious.\"\n\"But what if there is? Remember, there are mechanical lives in this world,\" Drexel insisted, though he knew it sounded far-fetched. He just couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off about PO.\n\"For a mechanical life to exist, it would need to be a level-eight mecha. Do you really think PO looks like a level-eight mecha?\" Arix replied, rolling her eyes.\n\"Well, no, not really,\" Drexel admitted, starting to doubt his theory. After all, PO seemed too delicate to even fend off a low-level insectoid, let alone be a level-eight mecha.\n\"Okay, enough with the wild ideas. Get your Lev out, let’s go home,\" Arix said. She had to meet Thaddeus later and didn’t have time for Drexel’s theories.\n\"Fine, fine, I get it,\" Drexel said, eager to get home and log in. He quickly brought out his Lev, and once they were both inside, they sped off toward the Kering family estate.\nAs they pulled up to the gate, they saw Fleur waiting.\n\"Mom, did you miss your little darling?\" Arix exclaimed, jumping out of Lev and running to Fleur, acting all sweet.\nFleur chuckled, patting Arix’s head affectionately. \"What do you think? Why else would I be out here?\"\nArix giggled happily.\nDrexel, putting Lev away, noticed something off. \"Mom, where’s Dad? I don’t see him,\" he asked, confused.\nArix glanced at Fleur, also curious.\n\"The Military Research Institute sent some people over. They’re checking on your dad’s health. They’re all in the living room right now,\" Fleur explained, not missing a beat.\n\"Let’s go check on him,\" Arix said, feeling a pang of worry since it had been nearly a week since she’d last seen Thaddeus.\nFleur nodded and led her children into the living room. Inside, they found Quillan, head of the Alliance Military Research Institute, busy examining Thaddeus with a range of instruments.\n\"Sir, is there any chance to restore my Psychic Incarnation?\" Thaddeus asked, his tone hopeful yet strained as he went through the tests.\nQuillan sighed and shook his head. \"Admiral Thaddeus, with our current technology, we haven’t found a way to revive a lost Psychic Incarnation.\"\nThaddeus’s shoulders slumped. \"I see...\" His voice was heavy with disappointment, the reality setting in that his Phantom might never return.\nQuillan tried to offer some comfort. \"Don’t give up hope, Admiral. Perhaps we’ll soon overcome this barrier with new advancements.\"\n\"Thank you,\" Thaddeus replied, though his expression was still clouded with sadness.\nJust then, Arix and her family arrived.\n\"Hello, sir,\" Arix greeted warmly upon seeing Quillan, a familiar face from her past.\n\"Ah, little Arix! You’ve grown and become even prettier,\" Quillan greeted back, smiling widely.\n\"Thank you, sir. You look good today,\" Arix replied, her voice sweet.\nQuillan chuckled, appreciating the compliment even though he knew it was just flattery. But then he remembered the seriousness of Thaddeus’s condition, and his smile faded slightly.\nHe turned to Arix, his expression thoughtful. \"Arix, your father’s physical health is stable, but we’re at a loss on how to restore his Psychic Incarnation. Do you have any insights?\"\nQuillan knew of Arix’s work in the psychic field and thought she might have some new ideas.\nArix’s face turned serious. \"There might be a way, though it’s still untested. I think there’s a good chance we could revive Dad’s Psychic Incarnation.\"\n\"Really?\" Thaddeus immediately perked up, looking at his daughter with a mix of anxiety and hope. He had resigned himself to the idea that her earlier reassurances were just to comfort him. But now, hearing her speak with such confidence, it felt like a lifeline.\nQuillan was equally surprised, his eyes wide with curiosity and excitement. \"Arix, are you serious?\" His voice carried a blend of shock and seriousness.\nIf what Arix suggested was true, it could be as groundbreaking as the discovery of the psychic power healing potion.\nThis freew(e)bnovel.(c)om",

      "content": "Chapter 194: Awakened Ware\nArix looked into the eager eyes staring back at her and nodded with determination. \"I’m serious. I wouldn’t joke about something like this.\"\nHearing her confirm it, Quillan and Thaddeus lit up with excitement. Thaddeus even started to cry quietly, murmuring, \"This is great, just great...\"\nQuillan, trying to keep his cool despite his excitement, asked carefully, \"Arix, how do we go about this? Do you need us to do anything?\"\nArix hesitated, unsure whether to share that she could grant ordinary people the ability to have Psychic Incarnation. Since discovering this power, she’d worried someone might misuse it. But thinking of the many Alliance soldiers who had given their lives, she began to doubt her silence.\nPsychic Incarnation was like a double-edged sword. It had its risks, but it could also strengthen the Alliance and reduce casualties. Plus, once they rescued Phantom, the truth would come out anyway. It seemed wiser to let the leaders handle it.\nWith her decision made, Arix looked at Quillan and said firmly, \"I can handle it myself. Only the Psychic Ware I create can bring Psychic Incarnations back.\"\n\"Really? Well, okay then,\" Quillan replied, a little disappointed there wasn’t more he could do to help.\nThen his eyes brightened with an idea. \"Can I watch?\"\nArix shook her head, looking apologetic. \"I’m sorry, but Psychic Ware isn’t solely my creation, so I can’t make that call. But I can ask my partner what he thinks.\"\nQuillan nodded, understanding. \"No worries, I was getting ahead of myself. Let’s focus on restoring your father’s Psychic Incarnation for now.\"\nArix nodded, agreeing. She then thought about the Psychic Ware that could create Psychic Incarnation.\nAfter a moment’s hesitation, she decided to wait until her father recovered before revealing this information. She also needed to consult Talrin, her research partner, as she couldn’t have developed the Psychic Ware without him.\nAfter considering it, Arix addressed everyone, \"I’m going to start carving the Psychic Ware now. It will take about an hour.\"\n\"Take your time. Even if it takes all day, that’s fine,\" Quillan said warmly, smiling.\nThaddeus and Fleur nodded encouragingly. \"Arix, do your best. It’s okay if it doesn’t work out,\" they reassured her.\nDrexel remained silent, wrestling with his thoughts. First, there was the psychic healing potion, and now this Psychic Ware that could restore Psychic Incarnation.\n’Is there anything Arix can not do?’\nEven though they had the same parents, he felt so different. Drexel worried that if Arix kept being so amazing, he’d end up feeling inadequate.\nArix didn’t really mind whether Drexel gave her encouragement or not. After saying goodbye to her parents, she was ready to head to her room and start carving the Psychic Ware.\nAs she walked by Drexel, he suddenly grabbed her wrist.\n\"Drexel?\" Arix looked at him, puzzled.\nDrexel held her gaze for a moment with a complicated expression. Then, he smiled and encouraged her, \"Good luck, Arix.\"\nHe released her hand, and Arix smiled back. \"Thanks, I’ll do my best,\" she replied before heading to her room.\nOnce his sister was out of sight, Drexel slumped onto the couch. In his mind, he asked his Psychic Incarnation, \"Sheer, why is my sister so smart and talented?\"\nThe big tiger in his psychic world had been napping. Hearing that question, he lazily opened one eye and teased, \"Because when your mom was giving birth to you, all the intelligence went to your sister.\"\nDrexel sighed internally.\n’Yeah, forget I asked. Just go to sleep.’\nIn her bedroom, Arix sat at her study desk. She took out a Vita Crystal and a knife from her Space Button, placing them on the desk.\nBefore starting, she took off her opticomputer and set it about a meter away on the desk. She tapped the screen and sent a video call request to Talrin.\nAfter a few rings, Talrin answered with a smile on his face. \"Arix, what’s up?\"\n\"Talrin, I’m about to start carving the Awakened Ware,\" Arix said, her voice steady.\nAwakened Ware was the name she and Talrin had given to the Psychic Ware capable of creating Psychic Incarnation.\nHearing this, the smile vanished from Talrin’s face, replaced by a look of surprise. \"Are you sure, Arix? This is serious stuff.\"\nArix felt a bit exasperated. Did she really seem like someone who would joke around about something this important?\n\"Talrin, I’m serious. I’m starting the carving right now,\" Arix said, showing him the Vita Crystal and the carving knife in her hands.\nTalrin was silent for a moment, then finally spoke, \"I’m sorry, Arix. I just didn’t expect we’d see the creation of the Psychic Ware capable of producing Psychic Incarnation so soon. It’s... surprising.\"\nArix nodded, understanding his reaction. Then she remembered something and asked, \"Talrin, I’m thinking of sharing the method to create Psychic Incarnation with the Alliance. What do you think?\"\n\"I have no objections. I never intended to keep it a secret. But Arix, make sure to mention my name when you announce it. My new association depends on it,\" Talrin said with a big grin.\nSeeing him so excited, Arix couldn’t help but smile too. \"Of course, Talrin,\" she agreed, feeling a little lighter.\nAfter Arix and Talrin hashed out their plan, Talrin knew it was time to wrap things up.\n\"Alright, that’s settled then. I won’t keep you any longer, Arix. I’ll hang up now,\" he said, realizing Arix’s first Awakened Ware was likely for someone special, so he didn’t want to overstay his welcome.\n\"Okay, goodbye, Talrin,\" Arix replied politely.\nWith a nod and a smile, Talrin ended the call on the opticomputer and started to head upstairs. Just then, a delivery robot showed up at the newly patched door, which was held together with wooden planks.\nThe robot gave a polite knock on the door and said in a mechanical yet courteous voice, \"Hello, Mr. Talrin, you have a package.\"\nCurious, Talrin went to accept the package, wondering if it was from his master or fellow disciples. But when he opened it, he found some Vita Crystals and a blueprint for Psychic Ware inside.",

      "content": "Chapter 195: Saving Thaddeus\nA mix of emotions crossed Talrin’s face as he pulled out the blueprint. He knew right away that Arix had sent it. In that moment, he felt grateful that his master had chosen Arix as an apprentice. Even someone as hard to impress as Talrin had to admit, Arix was incredibly thoughtful and a true gem.\nMeanwhile, Arix sat staring at the dark screen, feeling a sense of relief. Now, with Talrin’s support, she could work on the Awakened Ware without the worry of getting caught. She decided to reveal everything once she solved her father’s Psychic Incarnation issue.\nDetermined, Arix wasted no time. She picked up a carving knife and started engraving runes into the Vita Crystal.\nThe Vita Crystal was essential because it held Vita’s psychic power, symbolizing healing and rebirth. Only an Awakened Ware made from Vita Crystal could awaken a Psychic Incarnation; using a regular Insectoid Core, no matter how well carved, wouldn’t do the trick.\nAfter about half an hour, Arix set down the carving knife, pleased with the results.\nThe runes on the Awakened Ware began to glow, emanating a sense of spring and renewal just by holding it. However, this was just the first step; the Awakened Ware could awaken the Psychic Incarnation but couldn’t revive it fully.\nArix didn’t hesitate. She pulled out a scalpel from her space and made a swift cut on her palm, letting her blood drip onto the Awakened Ware.\nAs the golden-tinged blood flowed, Arix felt a swirl of emotions. Though she hadn’t received the complete Divine Beast heritage, she had spent a month contemplating how to revive her father’s Psychic Incarnation, and this method had naturally come to mind.\nSylvana’s blood could revive all spiritual entities.\nAs the blood covered the blueprint, the Awakened Ware started to emit a bright golden light.\nOnce she confirmed it was successful, Arix quickly retracted her hand and applied ointment from her Space Button to stop the bleeding.\nAfter treating her hand, Arix picked up the Awakened Ware, now infused with a lot of her blood. She cradled it in her palm, taking a moment to admire it.\nUnlike the typical Awakened Ware, this one, enhanced with Sylvana’s blood, had an ethereal transparency and beauty. It looked less like a piece of technology and more like a rare artifact from a mystical world.\nThe realization of the cost to create this piece made Arix shiver. For the first time, she felt grateful for her background. If she had still been as poor as when she first arrived, she might have ended up as a mining slave in some distant star system. The thought made her shudder, so she quickly shook it off and took the Psychic Ware, leaving her bedroom.\nIn the living room, Thaddeus, Fleur, and Quillan were anxiously waiting, while Drexel casually munched on an apple.\n\"Mom, Dad, don’t worry. Arix will be fine,\" Drexel said, glancing at the overly anxious family. He didn’t see why they were so tense; after all, it wasn’t like Arix was giving her life or something.\n\"What are you talking about? We’re not nervous,\" Fleur shot back, as she and the others turned to give Drexel a disdainful look.\nDrexel noticed Fleur’s fingers almost digging into the table; Quillan was pacing back and forth, and Thaddeus was looking like he might crush his own knees.\nDrexel rolled his eyes and continued eating his apple.\nAfter about ten more minutes, they heard footsteps on the stairs. Everyone turned expectantly as Arix finally came into view.\nAs Arix went down the stairs, Quillan eagerly asked, \"Arix, did it work?\"\nBoth Thaddeus and Fleur looked over, noticing their daughter’s pale lips, their expressions quickly shifting to concern.\nDrexel, who had stopped munching on his apple, asked worriedly, \"Arix, why do you look so pale?\"\nQuillan, noticing Arix’s condition as well, quickly moved to check her wrist. However, Arix hid her arm behind her back, smiling reassuringly. \"I’m fine, just a bit tired from carving the Psychic Ware,\" she explained.\nQuillan looked surprised but didn’t push further. Thaddeus and Fleur, on the other hand, were clearly worried.\n\"Arix, go rest. We can wait a day or two,\" Thaddeus said seriously, concern evident in his voice.\nFleur, feeling Arix’s cold forehead, added, \"Why are you still eating? Help your sister to her room to rest!\" she scolded Drexel.\n\"Oh, right, I’m coming,\" Drexel responded, quickly tossing his apple aside and moving to support Arix.\n\"No, really, I’m fine, Mom and Dad,\" Arix insisted, wanting to proceed with the treatment for her father.\nBut Fleur was having none of it. \"I know if you’re okay or not. Go rest, or I’ll have to get strict with you.\"\nArix, seeing the serious look on her mother’s face, decided not to argue. She knew her mom was truly worried.\nAs Drexel helped her to her room, Arix turned to Quillan, saying, \"Sir, my partner in the Psychic Ware research is Talrin. We developed the Psychic Incarnation together. You can ask him for more details. We’re willing to share the blueprint for this one, which we called Awakened Ware. Wait, let me finish...\"\n\"Alright, got it, now go rest,\" Quillan interjected, both amused and concerned as Arix was led away.\n\"Okay, goodbye, sir,\" Arix waved as Drexel guided her to her room.\nWith Arix settled, Quillan said his goodbyes to the Kering family and hurriedly left. He immediately bought a spaceship ticket to Mulado, only to realize the journey was too slow. He later switched to a Space-jumper ticket.\nWhile waiting during a transfer on the Space-jumper, Quillan began researching Talrin. To his surprise, he discovered Talrin’s extensive report from the military. He hadn’t expected Arix’s partner to be such a significant figure.\nThis revelation made things a bit awkward. Quillan had planned to have the Psychic Ware Association collaborate with Talrin on researching the Awakened Ware, but he hadn’t realized Talrin was the head of the New Psychic Ware Association.\nThe old and new associations were known for their rocky relationship. Quillan felt a twinge of embarrassment for the old association but quickly reassured himself, thinking, \"It’s not my problem. I’m just an innocent, powerless director. It’s up to them to figure out how to get along with each other.\"\nWith that, Quillan informed the Alliance president, the admirals of the five great armies, and the old Psychic Ware Association about the Awakened Ware, leaving the next steps in their hands.",

      "content": "Chapter 196: The Blueprint\nJust as Quillan anticipated, the admirals of the great armies were immediately alarmed upon receiving the information.\nThere was a closely held secret that most ordinary people were unaware of, but those in high positions knew very well: only those with Psychic Incarnation could control level-eight mechas.\nThe five major families had been using their Psychic Incarnations as keys to operate their respective level-eight mechas since ancient times.\nWhile ordinary individuals with Psychic Incarnation couldn’t command the level-eight mechas, members of those families could. After all, many families had siblings who could inherit this ability.\nMoreover, even if someone wasn’t from one of the five great families, possessing a Psychic Incarnation still allowed their mecha to reach a higher level of power.\nIf Awakened Ware could be mass-produced, it could potentially enable future mechas to be upgraded and modified based on these Psychic Incarnations.\nAnd most crucially, once Awakened Wares were released, the Alliance’s overall strength would undoubtedly soar.\nIn stark contrast to the excitement among the Alliance’s upper ranks, the air in the old Psychic Ware Association’s conference room was tense and heavy. The Psychic Ware Grandmasters and the association’s president were all glaring at Bryndel.\nBryndel, feeling the weight of their stares, cautiously glanced around before quickly lowering his head in fear. He sat silently, not daring to speak.\nThe silence stretched on until Seldner, known for his hot temper, finally broke it. \"Bryndel, how did you manage to let our Psychic Ware Association’s genius get scooped up by that upstart association?\" he demanded angrily. \"Now the entire Alliance knows that the Awakened Ware was developed by them. What does that do to our legitimate Psychic Ware Association’s reputation?\"\nBryndel kept his mouth shut, feeling the heat of the blame. He thought to himself that it wasn’t entirely his fault his apprentices were so promising.\nThrynn, another senior figure, added with biting sarcasm, \"We gave you the chance to mentor apprentices, and look what happened. You’ve basically handed our talent over to the upstarts. I’m starting to wonder if you’re working for them.\"\nBryndel internally sighed. He knew Thrynn had been unhappy about him taking on Arix as an apprentice from the beginning, and now she was also indirectly blaming the president for putting him in this position.\nOther Grandmasters in the Psychic Ware association started to question what was happening, and the murmurs in the conference room got louder.\nClearly, they weren’t happy.\nThey felt the spotlight should’ve been on their official association, not on some unknown group that somehow snagged the Awakened Ware results.\nThe grandmasters in the Psychic Ware association were seething with anger, barely able to breathe from the frustration. And poor Bryndel, who was now the focus of all those stares, felt incredibly wronged.\n’The Awakened Ware is Arix’s invention, so why are these old-timers acting like it’s stolen from them?’\nHe didn’t dare voice his thoughts, though, because it might cost him dearly in that tense room.\nJust as the Grandmasters seemed ready to scold Bryndel, the association’s president, Zorix, finally spoke up. \"Everyone, please calm down,\" he said, clasping his hands in front of him with a serene expression, like nothing could faze him.\nThe room quieted down, though the Grandmasters still eyed Bryndel warily.\nZorix, choosing to keep things simple, continued, \"This isn’t Bryndel’s fault, nor the fault of the small association you mentioned. Arix did a fantastic job developing the Awakened Ware, but let’s not forget, Talrin had been researching this for decades. Not too long ago, if I remember correctly, many of you laughed at him for being overly ambitious.\"\nAs Zorix finished, the room fell silent. No one had believed that a Psychic Ware capable of awakening a Psychic Incarnation was possible, and they had even mocked Talrin behind his back for dreaming too big.\nNow, with the tables turned, those past laughs only deepened their embarrassment.\nThe Grandmasters exchanged glances, no longer angry but clearly uncomfortable. The idea of this groundbreaking invention being in the hands of a smaller, often dismissed association didn’t sit well with them. They wondered if they really had to swallow their pride and ask for cooperation.\nSeldner, in particular, looked furious. He was too proud to ask that small group for anything. But as much as Seldner resisted, some of the other Grandmasters couldn’t hold back their questions any longer.\n\"President Zorix, who are we going to send to the New Psychic Ware association to ask for the Awakened Ware’s blueprint?\" one eager Grandmaster asked.\nZorix didn’t respond directly but instead posed a question of his own. \"Any volunteers?\" His words were met with silence once again.\nAll the Psychic Ware Grandmasters felt a twinge of guilt.\nSome stared up at the ceiling, others looked down at the floor, and a few just zoned out entirely.\nThe rivalry between the two Psychic Ware associations had been going on for ages, and almost everyone there was a veteran of the Psychic Ware association. Disputes and harsh words were the norm, but having to ask for cooperation now felt like a real blow to their pride.\nNoticing the awkward silence, Bryndel, who had been standing quietly in the corner, timidly raised his hand and said, \"Maybe I should go?\"\nThe moment he spoke, all eyes turned to him. But this time, the looks weren’t angry; they were more like expressions of realization or even relief.\n’Of course! How can we have forgotten about him?’\n\"President Zorix, I suggest Bryndel go. After all, he’s their master, so he’s got a better shot at getting the blueprint,\" Seldner said, his eyes lighting up with sudden enthusiasm. He even looked at Bryndel with a newfound friendliness.\nBryndel thought to himself, \"Seriously? Just say it without that creepy look.\"\n\"I agree, Bryndel is the best choice,\" Thrynn nodded, thinking the plan made sense. The other Psychic Ware Grandmasters quickly voiced their agreement as well.\nWith everyone on the same page, Zorix nodded in approval and announced, \"Alright, it’s decided. Bryndel will go.\"\nThe decision was made without any objections. As the Psychic Ware Grandmasters settled on this plan, Zorix turned his cold gaze to Bryndel, smiling in a way that was both kind and slightly threatening, \"Bryndel, you won’t let us down, will you?\"\nBryndel could only roll his eyes. With a deep breath, he patted his chest and promised, \"Don’t worry, I’ll get it done.\"\n\"Good, then this meeting is adjourned. Everyone can go,\" Zorix said, finally showing a smile.\nAs soon as the meeting ended, the Grandmasters practically rushed Bryndel out of the building, not giving him a moment to collect himself.\nStanding alone at the entrance of the Psychic Ware association, Bryndel watched the Grandmasters enthusiastically see him off.\nWith a sigh, he turned and set off alone towards the New Psychic Ware association.",

      "content": "Chapter 197: Bryndel’s Visit\nRight now, the New Psychic Ware Association is surrounded by military Levs and warships due to the Awakened Ware incident.\nMany of the poorer civilians from the Alliance had never witnessed such a scene. They stayed far back, secretly observing the spectacle.\nFortunately for them, the main gate of the Psychic Ware Association had been broken, giving them a clear view of everything happening inside the hall.\nInside the grand hall, the president of the New Psychic Ware Association, Talrin, was warmly serving tea to each visitor.\nQuillan, the representative of the visitors, politely accepted a teacup. He smiled as he took a sip, but his eyebrows immediately furrowed from the bitterness. Calmly putting down the teacup, Quillan thought to himself,\n’That’s some real bad tea. Is he unhappy with us?’\nHowever, he quickly dismissed the thought.\n’A president who can’t even afford to fix the gate probably doesn’t have bad intentions. Maybe he’s just broke.’\nWith that thought, Quillan smiled again and politely addressed Talrin, \"President Talrin, I believe you know why we’re here today. What do you think?\"\nTalrin nodded and replied, \"For the sake of Arix, I agree with the matter. But...\" He trailed off, looking troubled.\nSeeing this, Quillan smiled understandingly and said, \"If you have any difficulties, please let us know. We will do our best to help.\"\nTalrin pretended to be shy and said, \"This is a bit embarrassing.\"\n\"Not at all. We would feel uncomfortable taking you and Arix’s research results for free,\" Quillan replied politely.\nEncouraged, Talrin continued, \"Now that you said so... Speaking of this Awakened Ware, I’ve spent almost 20 years on it. I won’t talk about the hardships, but as you know, our New Psychic Ware Association is struggling. So, I hope you can agree to three conditions from me in exchange for the research results.\"\nTalrin hinted with his eyes at the nearly collapsing association, showcasing his month-long effort of not rebuilding to earn some sympathy.\nThinking this, Talrin’s lips curled slightly.\nQuillan lowered his eyes and thought for a moment, then said hesitantly, \"Could you please tell me your conditions? I am not the decision-maker of the Alliance and cannot decide alone.\"\n\"Of course, my conditions are very simple. The first condition is that I hope the Alliance officially recognizes the existence of the New Psychic Ware Association,\" Talrin said passionately.\nHe was tired of people calling his association a fake one.\nQuillan raised his eyebrows in surprise. He had expected the first condition to be about money. Instead, it was just official recognition from the Alliance. This condition was not only reasonable but surprisingly simple.\n\"President Talrin, I can agree to this condition on behalf of the Alliance. However, you understand that once you are officially recognized, you’ll also be bound by official regulations. Are you still willing?\" Quillan looked directly at Talrin, his tone serious.\nTalrin nodded confidently, a smile on his face. \"The greater the restriction, the greater the protection. Being bound by the Alliance is an honor.\"\n\"Alright, what’s the next condition?\" Quillan asked, seeing Talrin’s swift agreement.\n\"The second condition is...\" Talrin glanced around his association before continuing, \"Rebuild the New Psychic Ware Association here using the best building materials.\"\n\"Agreed! What’s the third condition?\" Quillan replied quickly, feeling almost embarrassed by how reasonable and simple the conditions were.\nFor the third condition, Talrin’s expression turned serious. \"The third condition is for the Alliance to establish a Psychic Incarnation Protection Law, granting them equal human rights.\"\nHearing this, Quillan’s expression finally changed. This was a significant request, one he couldn’t agree to directly.\n\"President Talrin, I will report your request to the president. I also hope this condition can be fulfilled,\" Quillan said firmly, looking sharply at Talrin.\nTalrin met Quillan’s gaze and smiled, \"Thank you, Director Quillan.\"\nAfter reaching an agreement, Talrin handed over a few Vita Crystals and a blueprint to Quillan. Once he had seen off the Alliance representative with a smile, Bryndel arrived at the new Psychic Ware Association, fashionably late.\n\"Master? What brings you here today?\" Talrin seemed unsurprised by Bryndel’s arrival.\n\"Just checking to see if you’ve starved to death,\" Bryndel said, rolling his eyes at his troublesome apprentice.\n\"Hehe, you always joke around,\" Talrin said warmly, inviting Bryndel in and serving him tea.\nBryndel eyed the tea suspiciously, then looked silently at his apprentice.\nSeeing his master’s murderous look, Talrin swallowed nervously and smiled sheepishly, \"Master, I already knew why you’re here. So just get comfortable. President Quillan and I have already reached an agreement.\"\nBryndel snorted arrogantly, his gaze sharp. \"You know what I want, right?\"\n\"Of course, Master. I have it ready for you,\" Talrin replied quickly, a stark contrast to his earlier hesitation with Quillan. He pulled out a Space Button.\nBryndel’s eyes gleamed with satisfaction at his Talrin’s promptness. He reached for the Space Button, but Talrin held onto it.\n\"Hmm?\" Bryndel’s look turned dangerous, ready to unleash his frustration.\nTalrin swallowed nervously. \"Master, you’re here on behalf of the old Psychic Ware Association, right? I have three small conditions. Can you agree to them on their behalf?\"\nBryndel raised an eyebrow, a smile playing on his lips. \"Go ahead, tell me.\"\nSensing a chance, Talrin’s enthusiasm grew. He moved behind Bryndel and began massaging his shoulders.\nOnce Bryndel relaxed, Talrin cautiously said, \"Master, I’m thinking of you. My first condition is that the old Psychic Ware Association grants you freedom. I know you’ll be free eventually, but until then, I can’t rest easy.\"\n\"That’s a good and sweet condition. What’s the next one?\" Bryndel asked, enjoying the massage.\n\"The second condition is money. I don’t need much, just 10 billion astrocredits,\" Talrin stated calmly.\nBryndel was taken aback, turning to stare at his apprentice. \"10 billion? That’s a bit too much... But alright, make it 20 billion. Half for me.\"\nTalrin laughed, agreeing, \"Alright, 20 billion it is.\"\n\"And the third condition?\" Bryndel asked, now in a good mood.\n\"I want both Arix and me to have a chance to study in the Knowledge Tower for a month,\" Talrin said firmly.\nBryndel, who had been enjoying the massage, suddenly froze. He quickly pushed Talrin away and moved to the opposite couch.\n\"Are you trying to get me killed?\" he shouted. \"If I suggest that to the Psychic Ware Association, they’ll execute me immediately!\"\nThe Knowledge Tower was the most guarded place of the Psychic Ware Association, containing all the ancient blueprints. It was their most prized asset, the source of their power.\nEven the elders could only enter once a year for three days. Asking for a month was beyond insane.\n\"No one in the Alliance would dare harm you now. Besides, it’s not just for me, it’s for Arix too,\" Talrin said sincerely.\nHearing Arix’s name, Bryndel hesitated for a long time before finally gritting his teeth and saying, \"Fine, I’ll try.\"\n\"Oh, thank you, Master! I knew you were the best!\" Talrin exclaimed, delighted. He started massaging Bryndel’s shoulders again.\nThis time, Bryndel was scared. He quickly dodged Talrin’s hands and impatiently waved him off, saying, \"Stay away from me.\"\nTalrin smiled helplessly and sat down on the opposite sofa, waiting for good news from his master.\nBryndel frowned as he sent the three conditions to President Zorix of the Psychic Ware Association.",

      "content": "Chapter 198: Bringing Back Phantom\nZorix was silent for a long time after receiving the message. Bryndel could already imagine the president’s furious reaction.\nThe thought of facing his president made Bryndel dread returning to the association. He feared he would be executed and turned into soup, with only his bones left for Talrin to collect.\nThe more he imagined, the gloomier Bryndel’s face became. He stared resentfully at Talrin, filled with regret for taking on such troublesome students.\nLorin was always running around, Jorvic was no better, and Talrin was the worst, constantly causing trouble. Only Arix, that sweet piece of candy, gave him a bit of solace.\nSighing, Bryndel shook his head wearily. While they waited tensely, a message finally came from the Psychic Ware Association.\nBryndel hurriedly opened it and read the contents, his changing dramatically.\nThe association had grudgingly agreed to the first two conditions. The third one, however, was modified: Arix could enter the Knowledge Tower for a month, but Talrin could only go for one day. If Talrin disagreed, the association would call off the deal and find another way.\nAfter hearing Bryndel’s explanation, Talrin smiled slyly and said, \"Master, please tell the association I agree to these terms. I originally just wanted to get Arix into the Knowledge Tower. I didn’t expect the association to be so generous.\"\nBryndel shook his head at his cheeky apprentice and then sent the response to the association. With no objections on either side, the deal was made.\nBryndel looked at his newfound proof of freedom and the 10 billion astrocredits in his account, feeling a mix of surprise and gratitude. Without hesitation, he grabbed the Space Button and left quickly, fearing Talrin might come up with another scheme.\nAs Bryndel hurried away, Talrin stood at the broken door, waving goodbye. Once Bryndel was out of sight, Talrin lowered his arm. He transferred 5 billion astrocredits to Arix and sent her an email granting her a month in the Knowledge Tower.\nAfter completing these tasks, Talrin whistled happily and walked upstairs with a spring in his step.\n...\nMorning sunlight spilled into the bedroom, gently waking Arix.\nShe stretched and yawned, feeling refreshed from a good night’s sleep. She even dreamt about receiving 5 billion astrocredits, vividly recalling the notification sound in her dream.\nThinking it was just a dream, she shrugged it off and headed to the bathroom to get ready.\nDownstairs, she found Thaddeus and Fleur cozily seated on the couch. Thaddeus was engrossed in legion work, while Fleur watched TV.\n\"Good morning, Dad and Mom,\" Arix greeted them with a bright smile, rushing over for a group hug. Fleur hugged her daughter warmly, her heart melting with affection. Thaddeus smiled at the scene, pulling them both into his embrace.\nAfter a bit, Arix pulled away and looked at Thaddeus. \"Dad, let’s save Phantom now,\" she said eagerly.\n\"You haven’t had breakfast yet. How about we wait a bit?\" Thaddeus suggested, concerned.\n\"It’s okay, it’ll be quick,\" Arix insisted with a playful pout. Seeing her determination, Thaddeus sighed and relented. \"Alright, alright, we’ll do it your way.\"\nArix grinned. \"Great! Here, Dad, hold this core.\" Thaddeus took the core, ready for the task.\n\"Now, close your eyes,\" Arix instructed. \"In the psychic world, use the core’s power to visualize Phantom. Once you see him, keep calling his name. Take your time; we’ll be waiting outside.\"\nIn the psychic realm, Thaddeus followed Arix’s guidance. He easily visualized Phantom—a small, black cat with two tails, the size of an ordinary house cat. Her jet-black fur and ruby-red eyes made her look both noble and mysterious.\nSeeing Phantom, Thaddeus’s eyes filled with tears.\n...\nPhantom had appeared when Thaddeus was just six years old.\nInitially, he thought she was a lost kitten, but when his hand passed through her, he realized it was unreal; more like a phantom. For a long time, Phantom’s blood-red eyes scared him to tears.\nIt was Frances who first noticed something was off with Thaddeus. After some gentle questioning, she discovered Thaddeus had awakened his own psychic incarnation.\nSeeing her son looking worn out, Frances couldn’t resist giving him a playful flick on the forehead. She then explained the psychic incarnations of the five major families. With this knowledge, Thaddeus realized Phantom wasn’t a ghost and began trying to interact with her.\nOne day, Thaddeus was attacked by other kids, and Phantom was the first to stand in front of him and protect him.\nFrom that moment, Thaddeus truly accepted Phantom, forming a bond with her. He chatted with Phantom daily, sharing his life.\nWhen Drexel was born, he even brought Phantom to the cradle to watch the baby curiously.\nThinking back on these warm memories, Thaddeus smiled. He began to call out, \"Phantom, Phantom, come back...\"\nWith each call, scattered light gathered at Phantom’s forehead.\nThaddeus’s voice grew hoarse, but he kept calling. As the light grew brighter, Phantom slowly opened her eyes, focusing on Thaddeus.\n\"Meow,\" Phantom called out, concerned. Her last memory was of Thaddeus being saved by a level-eight mecha. Though she knew Thaddeus was likely safe, she was still worried.\nHearing Phantom’s voice, Thaddeus’s tears flowed. He laughed, then sobbed more intensely. Phantom, thinking she had scared Thaddeus like before, stood nervously aside, unsure how to comfort him without making things worse.\nAfter a while, Thaddeus wiped his tears and opened his arms. \"Phantom, come here,\" he called softly.\nWith a meow, Phantom leapt into his arms without hesitation. Feeling the reality of Phantom, Thaddeus finally believed she was truly back.\n\"Meow,\" Phantom licked Thaddeus’s tears and rubbed against his cheek to comfort him.\nThaddeus petted Phantom and remembered that Fleur and Arix were waiting outside. He gently asked, \"Phantom, do you want to meet the one who saved you, little Arix?\"\n\"Meow,\" Phantom looked up at Thaddeus and nodded slightly.\n\"Alright, let’s go see her. I remember when you scared Arix to tears as a child,\" Thaddeus recalled with a hidden smile.\nPhantom remembered too and meowed in response.\nAs the sounds faded, Thaddeus and Phantom left the psychic world together.",

      "content": "Chapter 199: Five Billion\nIn the living room, Arix and Fleur, watched Thaddeus with bated breath. They were so worried about waking him that even their breathing slowed down.\nAfter a while, noticing Thaddeus still asleep, Fleur gestured toward the dining room, signaling Arix to go have breakfast.\nArix wanted to stay a bit longer, but under her mom’s increasingly stern look, she nodded obediently.\nFleur smiled, satisfied, and waved her off. Arix got up carefully and headed to the dining room.\nAs soon as she walked in, Evelyn, who was busy making strawberry jam, stopped and asked gently, \"Miss, what would you like for breakfast today?\"\n\"Evelyn, just some scrambled eggs, please,\" Arix said as she sat down at the table.\n\"Okay,\" Evelyn replied with a warm smile. She then turned to make the meal. A few minutes later, she placed the eggs and juice in front of Arix.\n\"Thank you, Evelyn,\" Arix said and started eating.\nWatching Arix eat happily, Evelyn said, \"Miss, there’s more in the pot. I’ll get you some more when you’re done.\"\n\"No need, Evelyn. This is enough,\" Arix smiled and declined.\n\"Alright, take your time,\" Evelyn said and continued making the jam.\nArix nodded with a smile and opened her opticomputer to check out the mecha master’s livestream. But as soon as the screen lit up, she saw a notification of a 5 billion astrocredit deposit in her account.\n\"Ahh, ahh, ahh...\" Arix choked on her eggs in surprise.\n\"Miss, are you alright?\" Evelyn asked, concerned.\nArix struggled to swallow the egg and quickly shook her head, \"I’m fine, I’m fine. The eggs were just so delicious, so I ate too quickly.\"\n\"Really? Then eat slower, Miss,\" Evelyn said, still a bit worried but reassured as Arix seemed okay.\n\"Okay,\" Arix replied hurriedly and started to check the source of the funds.\nSeeing that the transfer was from Talrin, Arix quickly opened his profile and sent a message.\n\"Arix: Did you transfer the wrong number?\"\nAfter a while, Talrin replied.\n\"Talrin: No, Arix. The old Psychic Ware Association asked me for Awakened Ware. They felt bad about getting it for free, so they gave me 20 billion astrocredits. Master Bryndel took 10 billion, and the other 10 billion is for us to split.\"\n\"Arix: This is too much. I didn’t do anything.\"\n\"Talrin: I know what you did, so just accept it. If you keep rejecting me, I’ll get mad.\"\n\"Arix: Okay, thank you.\"\n\"Talrin: Good.\"\n\"Talrin: By the way, Arix, the old Psychic Ware Association thought 20 billion wasn’t enough, so they gave you a pass to study at the Knowledge Tower for a month. You can go check it out when you have time.\"\n\"Arix: The Knowledge Tower? What’s that?\"\n\"Talrin: Look it up online. I have to go. Bye.\"\n\"Arix: Okay, goodbye.\"\nAfter saying goodbye, Arix searched the interstellarnet for information about the Knowledge Tower.\nKnowledge Tower\nCountry:\nThe Alliance\nOwner:\nThe Psychic Ware Association\nIntroduction:\nThe Knowledge Tower was built by the Rinn family in the early days of the Alliance. It houses the blueprints of all Psychic Ware from ancient times to the present. Therefore, the Knowledge Tower is considered a sacred place for every Psychic Ware Master, but it is also off-limits to everyone. Anyone who tries to enter without the Psychic Ware Association president’s permission can be killed on the spot by the tower’s guardians.\n...\nAfter reading the introduction, Arix swallowed nervously. She hadn’t expected such a great gift from her senior brother and the Psychic Ware Association. Studying in the Knowledge Tower for a month would significantly boost her skills in Psychic Ware.\nArix quickly decided to spend her summer break at the Knowledge Tower. After finishing her meal, she put down her spoon and said to Evelyn, \"Evelyn, I’m done eating. Thank you for your help.\"\n\"Sure. Just leave the plate on the table. The cleaner robot will take care of it,\" Evelyn replied with a gentle smile.\nArix thanked her again before leaving the dining room to check on Thaddeus.\nIn the living room, Thaddeus was still in his psychic world, and Fleur was guarding him.\nArix was surprised to see Matis and Kellan had also returned from the military.\n\"Grandpa, Kellan,\" Arix said softly, afraid of disturbing her father.\nKellan smiled warmly and nodded at Arix, saying, \"Good morning, Arix.\"\nMatis waved Arix over to sit next to him without speaking.\nWith a big smile, Arix sat next to Matis and said, \"I’m so happy to see you at home.\"\nMatis lovingly patted Arix’s head and said proudly, \"I know what you’ve done, Arix. You did very well. I’m so proud of you!\"\n\"Thank you. It’s what I should do,\" Arix said, blushing as she wrapped her arm around her grandfather’s.\nKnowing Arix’s shy nature, Matis stopped praising her, worried she would get too embarrassed. He gently patted her head again and said, \"You’re such a good kid. If Drexel were half as good as you, I’d be at ease for the rest of my life.\"\nArix felt a bit guilty at the praise, knowing that Drexel could be even better behaved than she was at times.\nMatis suddenly noticed Drexel was missing.\n\"Kellan, where’s Drexel?\" Matis asked, turning around.\nKellan pointed upstairs to Drexel’s room. \"He’s still sleeping.\"\nMatis sighed and rubbed his forehead. \"Kellan, why don’t you find a Psychic Incarnation for yourself? That way, I’d worry a lot less.\"\nKellan looked a bit regretful but relieved. \"I’m sorry, Grandpa. You know that’s impossible.\"\nMatis gave him a wistful look and then glanced at Arix. He quickly dismissed the idea; he didn’t want Arix to go through those hardships.\nFinally, Matis accepted reality and said to Kellan, \"I remember you’re about to become their assistant coach. Just take care of your brother during the special training.\"\nKellan smiled and nodded, \"I will, Grandpa.\"\nArix, listening nearby, blinked in confusion. \"Grandpa, is Kellan the assistant coach for the Alliance national mecha team?\"\nMatis nodded. \"Yes.\"\nArix’s eyes lit up. She hugged Matis’ arm and shook it playfully. \"Grandpa, you’ll be by my side whatever I do, right?\"\n\"Of course,\" Matis said proudly.\n\"If I try out for the national team, will you support me?\" Arix asked sweetly.\nDizzied by Arix’s charm, Matis didn’t catch the details and just agreed, \"Of course. I’ll cheer for you.\"\n\"Great! Thank you so much. I love you,\" Arix exclaimed joyfully.\nMatis didn’t realize what he’d agreed to; he was just happy to see Arix happy.\n\"Dad! Arix wants to join the new mecha competition. Wouldn’t that be too dangerous?\" Fleur reminded him, not pleased.\nMatis finally understood. He looked at Arix with concern. \"Arix, your mom’s right, it’s too dangerous. How about we skip it?\"\n\"Grandpa, that’s not fair. You already agreed. Besides, I’m from a family of soldiers; how can I chicken out because of danger?\" Arix argued firmly.\nSeeing her determination, Matis couldn’t bear to refuse. He turned to Fleur for help.\nFleur sighed. She stepped in, \"Arix, Drexel is going this time. I can’t have both kids take risks. You don’t want to make me sad, right?\"\nArix knew Fleur was serious. She didn’t want to make her sad, but she also didn’t want to be just someone who got protected.\n\"Mom, I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be someone who just avoids danger. Please let me go. I promise I’ll come back safe,\" Arix said, her eyes filled with determination.\nHer words put Fleur in a difficult spot. She couldn’t bear to refuse Arix’s first serious request.",

      "content": "Chapter 200: Meow-Meow\nWhile Fleur was struggling, Thaddeus woke up and took her hand, calming her down. He then looked at Arix and said, \"If you want to go, you can. But you must stay safe. If not, I can still stop you from continuing.\"\nSeeing her father agree, Arix knew Fleur wouldn’t be far behind, so she happily nodded.\nWatching Arix’s excitement, Thaddeus felt a wave of happiness, though he also had a reason to cry. He glanced down at Fleur’s hand pinching his waist and forced a smile at her.\nFleur looked at her silly husband, sighed, and let go. Arix then hugged and comforted her for a long time until she felt better.\nOnce the tension eased, Thaddeus raised his eyebrows and secretly gave Arix a thumbs-up.\nArix winked playfully but then noticed the black cat on Thaddeus’s shoulder and asked in surprise, \"Dad, is this Phantom?\"\nEveryone turned to look at the cat. After a moment, Matis was the first to exclaim, \"She’s really revived. Amazing.\"\nKellan sincerely praised, \"That’s incredible.\"\nFleur smiled and gently touched Arix’s hand. Feeling a bit embarrassed by the praise, Arix quickly said, \"It’s not all my work. Talrin helped a lot. Without him, I couldn’t have created Awakened Ware so easily.\"\nEveryone knew Talrin, and Matis nodded in agreement, \"We should thank him properly. He’s helped our family a lot.\"\nThaddeus nodded and then, holding Phantom, said to Arix, \"Phantom wants to say something to you.\"\nArix looked at the cat curiously, waiting patiently. Phantom seemed a bit shy under her gaze. She meowed gratefully at her before jumping behind Thaddeus to hide and observe her.\nArix blinked in confusion, \"What did she say? I don’t understand cat language.\"\nThaddeus grinned as he watched Arix and Phantom interact. Seeing Arix’s puzzled expression, he translated, \"Phantom said, thank you for saving her.\"\nArix’s eyes lit up with understanding. Turning to Phantom with a gentle smile, she said, \"Phantom, you saved my dad too, so I owe you for that.\"\nPhantom, feeling bashful from the gratitude, let out a tiny meow and hid behind Thaddeus.\nTouched by Phantom’s words, Thaddeus looked at her and smiled, then translated, \"Phantom said you don’t need to thank her. She did it willingly. Plus, she said protecting me is her job.\"\nEveryone felt warmed by Phantom’s sincerity and showered the little Psychic Incarnation with praise.\nThe weekend flew by in a blur of laughter and joy.\nBefore they knew it, the school day had arrived.\nArix and Drexel had just stepped onto the campus when they spotted a military spaceship parked in the school square.\nThey exchanged glances, both suspecting the spaceship was there because of the national mecha team selection.\n\"This selection is going to be tough. The military even sent a ship,\" Drexel mused, eyeing the enormous spacecraft.\n\"Is the mecha competition always like this?\" Arix asked, curiosity evident in his voice.\nDrexel shook his head. \"No, the military usually doesn’t get involved with the freshman mecha competition. And they certainly don’t make a big show of it.\"\n\"Maybe they care more about this selection,\" Arix guessed.\n\"Maybe. It’s almost 8 o’clock, we should get going,\" Drexel said, giving the spaceship one last look before heading off.\nArix followed, not noticing the serious expression on Drexel’s face.\nDrexel couldn’t shake the feeling that there were too many prodigies this year. Besides the Empire’s Crown Prince Cassian and his sister, hailed as the Alliance’s hope, other geniuses from various countries seemed to have emerged out of nowhere.\nDrexel didn’t believe in coincidences but couldn’t pinpoint the reason. He did understand why the military was so invested in this competition.\nIt was likely because they noticed the exceptional talents from other countries. If their own country’s talents were overshadowed, it would be embarrassing.\nDrexel and Arix soon reached a bustling area. The national mecha team selection was being held at the Department of Combat’s training ground.\nUnlike usual, the gate was not wide open. Students who signed up for the national team had to register and check in at the entrance before being allowed in.\nThe process moved quickly. Arix gave her name to the teacher handling registration, who tapped away on the opticomputer before calling the next student.\nAfter passing the check, Arix and Drexel headed straight to the training ground. They joined the two hundred students already there, waiting for the selection to begin.\n\"Arix!\"\nA familiar voice called out. Arix looked around and saw Deanna and her brother waving enthusiastically.\n\"Deanna!\" Arix waved back with equal enthusiasm. She grabbed Drexel’s hand and made her way over to them.\nDrexel’s two close friends were with Deanna and her brother. Once everyone was together, they started discussing the selection process.\n\"I heard our examiner for this selection is a Rear Admiral sent by the military, so everyone’s feeling the heat,\" Kael said. He had arrived early and, being friendly, had already picked up some intel.\n\"No way! A Rear Admiral? Isn’t that a bit much?\" Deanna exclaimed.\nArix nodded in agreement. Typically, a Rear Admiral only visited the military academy when senior students were graduating to recruit for their units. Seeing one on an ordinary day was as rare as finding gold on the street—possible, but not likely.\n\"It’s possible. You know, only a Rear Admiral could bring a spaceship to the academy,\" Drexel said. He had already guessed this, so he wasn’t surprised.\nHearing this, Arix and the others gasped. Tevian sighed, \"Looks like this selection won’t be a walk in the park.\"\nTheir conversation was cut short by the sound of the selection process starting.\nArix and her friends looked up to see their president walking alongside an officer in a Rear Admiral’s insignia. Behind them were two captains and their mentor, Jonna, along with other mentors.\nThis impressive group immediately drew the attention of all the military students. Most of them, who came from Planet Waste, had never seen a Rear Admiral before and looked at him with awe and admiration.\nBut there were two exceptions in the crowd: Arix and Drexel.\nThey recognized the Rear Admiral; he was their big brother, Kellan.",

      "content": "Chapter 201: The Price of Success\nKellan strolled alongside the president, his eyes catching sight of his younger siblings. He smiled and waved at them.\nArix and Drexel were taken aback at first, but soon, they grasped the situation and waved back, grinning.\nArix and Drexel’s reaction seemed typical, but the nearby military students thought the Vice Admiral was waving at them. Suddenly, the place exploded with cheers, as if a rock star had just walked in.\n\"Did you see that? The Rear Admiral waved at me! I’m over the moon!\"\n\"No way, he was waving at me!\"\n\"Sir, you’re my hero for life!\"\n\"Sir, look over here!\"\nThe entire square buzzed with excitement and shouts.\nGunder, the president, sighed, unable to handle the overzealous students. He shook his head and said to Kellan, \"Rear Admiral Kering, forgive the students’ shouts and yells. They can be a bit unruly.\"\n\"That’s very kind of you, sir. The students are wonderful. Also, please just call me Kellan,\" Kellan responded modestly.\nGunder nodded with a smile, his respect for Kellan soaring. It was hard not to admire such a polite and respectful young man. Feeling content, Gunder and Kellan continued to chat as they walked to a spot a few meters ahead of the students.\nGunder, the president of HMA, stepped forward after sharing a nod with Kellan. Clearing his throat, he began, \"Everyone, please quiet down.\"\nThe students immediately hushed, their eyes fixed on Gunder.\n\"Hello, my dear students. I am your president, Gunder. You all know why you’re here today. I need to remind you that this competition is very dangerous. One moment of carelessness could cost you your life. If anyone wants to quit, you can leave now. Those who lack the determination to fight should also quit early because if you fear death or hard work, enduring the harsh training and the future mecha competition will be impossible. That’s all I have for you. Now, if anyone wants to quit, you can turn and leave and there won’t be any consequences.\"\nGunder scanned the crowd, looking for any signs of retreat. But after a few moments, no one moved.\nA mix of relief and solemnity washed over Gunder. He looked seriously at the students and said, \"Since no one wants to quit, we’ll have Rear Admiral Kellan explain the rules of this selection. Please give him some applause.\"\nThen Gunder stepped aside, making room for Kellan. He raised his hand, signaling for silence, and the students immediately hushed, their eyes glued to him with eager anticipation.\n\"Hello everyone, I’m Kellan Kering, your examiner for this selection. Time is short, so let’s dive right in. There are three stages in this selection. The first stage is the simplest. All you need to do is fill this Subgiant Class container with psychic power. Those who succeed will advance to the next stage. Those who fail will be eliminated,\" Kellan announced with a stern tone.\nThe students’ expressions turned serious as they recognized the container in Kellan’s hand. Filling a Subgiant-Class psychic power container required at least Subgiant-Class psychic power.\nSome students with lower psychic power looked as if they’d just seen a disaster. They knew they couldn’t fill it no matter how hard they tried. These students sighed and chose to quit the test early, although they stayed to watch the others.\nKellan continued, explaining the next stage. \"The second stage involves passing through a level-three dimensional training ground, but you can’t bring any equipment or weapons, including mechas,\" he added ruthlessly.\nThe students erupted in disbelief. The idea of navigating a level-three training ground without any equipment or mechas seemed like a death sentence. Their initial admiration for Kellan quickly morphed into fear, and they looked at him as if he were a monster.\nArix and Drexel were stunned. Drexel leaned in, trying once more to persuade Arix, \"Arix, maybe you should quit. I don’t want to lose you.\"\n\"Shut up!\" Arix snapped, glaring at Drexel. They hadn’t even started yet, and he was already doubting her!\nSeeing Arix’s anger, Drexel clammed up. Arix snorted and began plotting how to tackle the level-three training ground unarmed.\nThough she’d never faced a level-three training ground before, Arix had heard it was like fighting through a bug nest solo.\nWithout equipment or weapons, it was almost certain failure. But she wasn’t about to back down.\nLike Gunder had said, \"if you don’t have the determination to fight to the death, you might as well quit early.\" Success always comes at a price.\nIf others could do it, and Drexel could do it, then Arix wouldn’t back down.\nWith this mindset, Arix’s resolve solidified.\n...\nKellan observed the students’ reactions with a cool face. When the moment felt right, he said, \"The second stage is a bit tough, but don’t worry. If you encounter life-threatening danger, you can opt out. However, keep in mind, quitting means losing your shot at selection.\"\nHearing this, the military students felt a wave of relief. It was still risky, but at least it wasn’t a death sentence.\nOnce everyone settled down, they turned their attention back to Kellan, eagerly awaiting the details of the third stage.\nKellan raised a finger to his lips, adding a touch of mystery, \"The third stage is a secret. Only those who pass the second stage will find out. Now, get ready. I officially announce the start of the selection.\"\nAs soon as the words left his mouth, the military students surged toward the first stage. There were ten passages, each monitored by a selection officer from the military, keeping an eye on Subgiant Class containers.\nThe students lined up, each placing a hand on a container and channeling their psychic power. Once the container was full, the officer would gather the psychic power into a special bottle and say, \"First stage passed. For the second stage, head left for 305 meters to No. 55 Dimensional Training Field.\"\n\"Thank you, sir,\" the student would reply before heading to the designated location.\nThe line moved swiftly, and soon it was Arix’s turn.\n\"Name,\" the selection officer asked bluntly.\n\"Arix Kering,\" Arix responded, saluting smartly.\nThe officer’s eyes widened slightly in surprise, not expecting to encounter the renowned developer of psychic power healing potions.\n\"Arix, the second stage is very dangerous,\" the officer warned, unable to hide his concern. He knew he was overstepping, but he couldn’t help it. He didn’t want this talented young woman, who had saved many of his comrades, to risk her life in this selection. Her safety seemed far more important than the freshman mecha contest.\n\"Don’t worry, sir. I’ll be careful,\" Arix replied confidently, though she couldn’t understand why the officer was so concerned.\nSeeing that he couldn’t change her mind, the officer sighed, \"Put your hand on the container.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 202: Dimensional Training Field No. 100\nArix nodded and placed her hand on it, quickly filling the container with psychic power in mere seconds. Her talent and strength made the officer feel uneasy, like seeing something precious being risked unnecessarily.\n\"First stage passed. For the second stage, go left for 435 meters to No. 100 Dimensional Training Field.\"\n\"Thank you,\" Arix said with a smile, then bid farewell to Deanna and the others before heading to the second stage.\nThe selection officer watched Arix walk away, shook his head, and sighed before turning to the next student, \"Name?\"\nMeanwhile, Arix made her way toward Training Field No. 100. She was surprised to see that each Dimensional Training Field was guarded by an Alliance soldier and a military medic. Even more surprising was that at least a hundred Dimensional Training Fields were open today.\nEvery time a student entered a Dimensional Training Field, the door would close and stay shut until the student either passed or was eliminated.\nJust then, a door opened, and a severely injured and unconscious student, covered in blood, was teleported out. The Alliance soldier and medic at the door immediately began treating the injured student.\nSeeing the student’s body covered in wounds as if torn by some wild animal, Arix’s heart sank, and she felt a wave of seriousness wash over her.\nShe remembered this student had passed the first stage just a few minutes before her.\n’How difficult is the second stage to cause such injuries in such a short time?’\nArix stood still, watching as the student was treated and taken away before continuing to Training Field No. 100. Like the others, it was guarded by an Alliance soldier and a medic.\nAs she approached, the soldier asked coldly, \"Name?\"\n\"Arix Kering, sir,\" she said, saluting.\nThe soldier registered her name in the opticomputer and opened the door to the Dimensional Training Field. \"The map has been sent to your opticomputer. There is no time limit. Reach the endpoint alive to pass,\" the soldier said seriously.\n\"Understood,\" Arix nodded, taking the task to heart. Just as she was about to step inside, the soldier added, \"Arix Kering, be careful.\"\nArix paused, thanked him, and stepped into the second stage without hesitation.\nAs soon as she entered, she was engulfed in complete darkness. Arix frowned and used her psychic power to form a protective barrier around herself. Then she closed her eyes and used her psychic power to scan her surroundings.\nWhen her mental awareness revealed the environment, Arix was stunned. She found herself in a dark, common cave, but it was filled with countless huge, fat snakes.\nAs soon as she noticed them, the snakes noticed her too. Instantly, numerous glowing vertical pupils, like stars in the dark, lit up the cave, all focusing on the only source of warmth—Arix.\nArix stood unsteadily, catching her breath. She glanced up and locked eyes with the giant snakes.\nBefore she could react, the snakes lunged at her.\nFearful, Arix gulped and leapt to dodge the attack.\nShe quickly opened her opticomputer. After finding the cave’s exit, she turned and bolted.\nThe tasty prey was on the move, and the giant snakes slithered after her.\nOne by one, they opened their huge mouths and sped towards Arix.\nFortunately, snakes, without legs, couldn’t match the speed of a running human. Arix soon put some distance between them.\nJust as she started to feel a bit safe, she saw a giant snake, which had lagged behind, suddenly leap in front of her.\n\"Oh no, I forgot snakes can jump!\"\nShe looked back and saw the snakes coiling their bodies. Using their tails like springs, they launched themselves at her.\n\"Hey! You can’t do that! That’s basically cheating!\" Arix yelled.\nThe snakes didn’t care about her thoughts. They raised their tails and whipped them towards the hysterical human.\nArix ducked and rolled forward just in time.\nThe thick snake tail slammed into the hard cave wall, kicking up a lot dust.\nSitting nearby, Arix stared in horror at the wall, which now had a deep dent. Her pupils widened in fear.\nShe sprang up and continued running towards the cave exit.\nThe snakes, frustrated by their inability to catch her, grew angrier.\nNow, they weren’t just hungry. They were out for blood.\nTheir venomous fangs extended, releasing toxic venom that turned into deadly projectiles aimed at Arix.\nIf they couldn’t catch her, they’d poison her.\nThe dense venomous attacks filled the cave. Even if Arix tried to dodge, she couldn’t avoid them all.\nHer psychic power shield took the hits, but the venom started to corrode it.\nArix checked her map; the exit was near. She repaired her psychic shield and kept running.\nOnly a fool would stay and fight here.\nShe didn’t know how long she had been running, but finally, she saw light ahead.\nOverjoyed, she sped up and finally stepped out of the cave.\nAfter running a few hundred meters more, Arix stopped. She wasn’t going to run anymore.\nTurning around, she smiled kindly at the giant snakes. \"You must be tired from chasing me. Now it’s my turn to repay you.\"\nAs she spoke, Arix raised her hands. Instantly, her psychic power formed countless deadly arrows in the air.\nWith a swift motion, the arrows shot towards the snake horde like a storm.\n\"Hiss!\"\nThe snakes hissed and screeched in pain. The leading ones fell, dead and wounded.\nBut the ones in the back quickly replaced the fallen.\nSeeing the snakes refuse to back down, Arix knew it was time to bail. With one more attack, she turned and fled.\nHer goal wasn’t to kill these beasts. It was to survive and reach the end.\nShe still had about 25 kilometers to cover.\nArix ran, dodging attacks from other animals along the way.\nInitially, she hadn’t planned to fight any of them, but the snake chase had attracted more beasts. Now, a whole zoo’s worth of creatures was on her tail.\nShe glanced back and saw an array of animals chasing her. Among them were even alpacas and capybaras, which left her utterly speechless.\n’What were these herbivores doing in the mix?’\nAs time went on, the group of beasts grew larger and stronger.\nArix was starting to struggle. She wasn’t hurt, but dodging attacks while running was exhausting. Despite her good physical condition, she felt short of breath and tightness in her chest.\nShe needed to put and end to this.\nArix bit her lip. She had to use her ultimate move.\nHaving decided, Arix dove into a bush. The beasts followed.\nBut once inside, Arix vanished.\nThe beasts were baffled and searched the area but couldn’t find her.\n\"Roar! Roar! Roar!\" The beasts circled in frustration. Some even started digging, thinking she had gone underground.\nThey searched for a long time but couldn’t find her.\nJust as they were about to give up, a small winged tiger appeared out of nowhere. She lifted her cute paw and pointed forward, meowing softly.\nThe nearby beasts, not the smartest bunch, quickly understood the cub’s meaning.\nThe human had run that way!\n\"Roar! Roar!\" The beasts roared excitedly and chased in the direction the cub pointed.\nLeft behind, the small tiger, who was actually Arix, finally sighed in relief.\nHer legs went weak, and she collapsed onto the grass, not wanting to move.\nWhat a nightmare! She hadn’t expected the second challenge to be a deadly chase.\nNo wonder the previous student got bitten so badly...\nAmen!",

      "content": "Chapter 203: In The Meeting Room\nIn HMA’s conference room, reps from the academy and the corps gathered around a table, deep in discussion about the ongoing selection.\nPresident Gunder led the academy’s side, flanked by several first-year mentors. On the corps’ side, Kellan sat with his two adjutants. All eyes were glued to the screen, tracking the students’ every move. Praises flew when a student performed well.\n\"Deanna and Marceau, despite their rocky pasts, have skills just shy of the Drexel siblings. I think they have a solid shot at getting selected,\" one representative remarked.\n\"Rahan stands out too. His combat skills might not top the charts, but his escape tactics are top-notch. Ideal for scout,\" another added.\n\"And let’s not forget Dollan. His talent puts him among the top freshmen, and his dedication secures him a spot in the top five,\" someone else chimed in.\n\"Still, Drexel is the best. Whether he’s surrounded by beasts or fighting solo, he comes out on top every time. His skills make him the top student of the first year,\" a mentor praised, eyes fixed on the screen showing Drexel in action.\nNods of agreement came from both mentors and corps reps, all acknowledging Drexel’s exceptional performance.\n\"He’s impressive, but a bit wasteful,\" Gunder sighed, clearly upset about the beasts Drexel had taken down.\nThough these beasts weren’t pricey, getting them from the battlefield to the training grounds was costly. Normally, they were there to help students practice escaping, but with Drexel, it seemed the beasts were the ones in need of escape practice.\nThe mentors chuckled at their president’s distressed expression. Kellan also smiled slightly at Drexel’s show on the screen. But his focus soon shifted to another screen, searching for his Arix. After a while with no sign of Arix, worry crept into his eyes.\nNoticing his concern, a mentor asked, \"Where is Arix? She vanished after entering those bushes.\"\nEveryone’s mood shifted, concern mounting at the thought of Arix being in danger. They quickly mobilized all the nano-flying cameras in the 100th Dimensional Training Field, searching anxiously.\nDespite their efforts, Arix remained elusive.\n\"Could Arix have been eliminated?\" an instructor speculated.\n\"No way. She isn’t that weak,\" Kellan shot back, a hint of frustration in his voice. He fiddled with his opticomputer, and soon the screen displayed a small, exhausted tiger.\nWhen they saw the small tiger, everyone finally pieced together where Arix had gone. They had almost forgotten someone at the academy had therian blood.\n\"Doesn’t Arix look adorable as a little tiger?\" Jonna said, relaxing as she cupped her face and stared at the screen.\nThe small tiger lay flat like a pancake, looking cute and clumsy with a hint of dazed innocence. The golden emblem on its forehead made her look noble and mysterious, while the gold around her eyes gave her a sacred and more exquisite appearance.\n\"Absolutely, even real tiger cubs aren’t this cute,\" Gunder agreed, nodding.\n\"I bet her fur is super soft. I wonder how it feels,\" another mentor said dreamily.\nKellan remained silent, just gazing lovingly at his sister, though the slight smile on his face showed his good mood.\nOn the Dimensional Training Field...\n\"Achoo!\" Arix suddenly sneezed. She rubbed her nose with a paw, feeling a bit uncomfortable. She had the odd sense someone was talking about her.\nPuzzled, Arix rubbed her nose again and started flying toward the finish line.\nIn her beast form, the second checkpoint felt like a child walking through a busy street. She drew a lot of attention from the other beasts, but none attacked her. Arix reached the finish line with ease.\nBefore crossing it, she pressed a button on her wristband. A layer of invisible film covered her furry body, hiding it from view.\nThe wristband, specially designed for the Empire’s therians, prevented any accidental exposure when they shifted back to human form.\nOnce Arix transformed back into her human form and dressed, the invisible film automatically disappeared. After ensuring everything was in order, she confidently stepped out of the second checkpoint.\nThe nano cameras had a privacy function. It turned off automatically when the target was sleeping, changing clothes, or bathing.\n...\nAs Arix stepped out of the Dimensional Training Field, she spotted an officer by the exit holding a drink. He saw her, approached, and handed her the drink.\nThe scene felt oddly familiar to Arix, triggering a tense silence between them.\nThe last time someone offered her a drink, it left deep psychological scars.\nNoticing Arix’s hesitation, the officer quietly initiated a video call to Kellan.\nSoon, Kellan’s kind and handsome face appeared on the screen.\n\"Kellan?\" Arix’s surprise was evident as she glanced between the officer and Kellan.\n\"Arix, the third level is unique. This drink is specially made for you. You need to drink it to proceed,\" Kellan reassured her with a warm smile.\n\"Alright, I understand,\" Arix sighed, taking the drink and downing it in one go. The peach flavor was unexpectedly pleasant.\nOnce she finished, the officer ended the call with Kellan and addressed Arix in a cold tone, \"Follow me.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" she responded, trailing behind him. They eventually entered a small room where another officer in a white lab coat awaited.\nSeeing Arix, his expression soured slightly, and he turned to the cold officer.\n\"Did she drink it?\" the white-coated officer asked with a mix of annoyance and relief.\nThe cold officer nodded, \"She drank it.\"\nThe white-coated officer exhaled, \"Good. You can get the next student.\"\n\"Alright,\" the cold officer replied before leaving, leaving Arix standing there, puzzled.\n\"Arix, come lie down,\" the white-coated officer instructed with a gentle smile.\nThough finding the whole situation odd, Arix complied and lay down on what looked like a dentist’s chair.\n\"Good. Now, close your eyes gently...\"\nArix followed his instructions.\n\"Very good. Now, relax your body and find the most comfortable position...\"\nAs the officer’s words sank in, Arix began to understand his intention. But she had no secrets, and with Cupid and the others around, she felt safe.\nLetting her guard down, she drifted off under the influence of the drink and his soothing voice.\nOnce Arix was under, the officer began his questioning softly.\n\"Your name?\" he asked gently.\n\"Arix Kering,\" she replied, still asleep.\nSatisfied, the officer confirmed she was hypnotized.\n\"Sir, you can come out now,\" he said, turning to Kellan, who had been observing quietly.",

      "content": "Chapter 204: Selection Over\nFrom the start, Kellan had been watching with an intense gaze. The hypnosis was part of a military plan, and the hypnotist was merely following orders.\nSighing, he thought,\n’sometimes trouble finds you even when you’re just doing your job.’\n\"Doctor, thank you for your hard work,\" Kellan said, ending his invisibility spell with an awkward cough. He knew he was unfairly blaming the innocent hypnotist, but watching his sister being so vulnerable was almost too much for him. It took all his willpower not to pull her away.\nThe doctor waved dismissively and calmly. \"Just doing my job. But hurry with your questions. Arix’s psychic power is strong; I can only keep her under for 15 minutes.\"\n\"Thank you,\" Kellan nodded. He turned to Arix and asked seriously, \"Arix, who do you like more, me or Drexel?\"\nArix’s eyes twitched, and her brow furrowed as if she might wake up.\nThe doctor’s mouth twitched in frustration. He quickly intervened, \"What’s your big brother’s name?\"\n\"Kellan,\" Arix replied, her frown easing.\nThe doctor sighed in relief and glared at Kellan, \"Sir, please avoid asking such personal questions during hypnosis.\"\nAsking controversial questions like, \"Who do you love more, Mom or Dad?\" or \"Which came first, the chicken or the egg?\" during hypnosis is a big no-no. It reduced the effectiveness and could wake the person prematurely.\nKellan rubbed his nose, feeling guilty. \"Sorry, doctor. That was my mistake.\"\nThe doctor rolled his eyes and warned, \"There are only ten minutes left. Please stick to the necessary questions now, sir.\"\n\"I understand.\" Kellan, never before so openly chastised, quickly got to the important questions.\n\"Arix, will you betray the Alliance?\" Kellan asked seriously.\n\"No,\" Arix answered softly.\n\"If killing one innocent person could save 100, what would you choose?\"\n\"Life is priceless. As long as I have a clear conscience.\"\n\"Is being a military student tough?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Why don’t you give up?\"\n\"Because I have someone to protect.\"\n...\nArix had no idea how many questions she answered while under hypnosis. When she woke up, her throat was dry, but she felt like she’d just taken a nap.\n\"Awake? You’ve passed the third level. There’s an officer outside to take you to the next stage,\" the doctor said gently.\nArix nodded slightly and left the small room.\nWatching her leave, the doctor finally breathed a sigh of relief. He silently prayed, hoping he’d never have to deal with this sibling duo again in his life.\nArix swung open the door and found an Alliance soldier standing there.\nWith a warm nod, he said, \"Follow me,\" and led the way.\n\"Okay,\" Arix replied, trailing behind him.\nAfter a brief stroll, the soldier halted at a door marked \"Meeting Room.\" He knocked three times.\n\"Come in,\" Kellan’s voice called from inside.\nArix was surprised to see Kellan there. She knew he was an officer, but she wondered if this meant she had passed the selection.\nThe officer beside her didn’t catch her thoughts. He nudged the door open slightly and gestured, \"Go in. You’re the last one.\"\nArix was puzzled.\n’The last one for what?’\nConfused, she nodded and stepped inside alone.\nAs soon as she entered, it clicked. Besides the military academy reps and corps members, there were six other military students in the room. With her, they hit the selection quota.\n\"Arix, take a seat,\" Kellan said with a fond smile.\nNodding, Arix spotted Drexel with two unfamiliar students and chose to sit near Deanna and her brother.\n\"Arix, you made it too!\" Deanna exclaimed, hooking her arm around Arix’s.\n\"Yeah, looks like just the four of us passed,\" Arix said, eyeing the other students.\nApart from Drexel, Deanna, and Marceau, the rest were unfamiliar faces.\nDeanna sighed, \"Too bad some of our friends didn’t make it through the second round.\"\n\"The second round was tough,\" Arix agreed, glancing at the newcomers. One was tall and lean, with features like a Persian cat—curly hair and handsome. The other was imposing, with a strong face and the air of a wolf.\nOddly, Arix saw animals in them—a lazy kitten, a fierce wolf, and Drexel, who seemed like a silly husky in the middle.\nJust then, Drexel waved with a goofy grin, looking even more like a husky.\nArix couldn’t help but smile and waved back.\nWith everyone present, Kellan, sitting at the head of the table, cleared his throat and looked at the students seriously.\n\"First, congratulations on passing the selection competition. From now on, you’re members of the Alliance’s National Mecha Team.\"\nHe began to clap, and the other officers and mentors joined in.\nThe six students felt a bit shy amidst the applause, but pride shone in their eyes.\nAfter the applause died down, Kellan continued with a serious tone, \"You’ve passed the military academy selection, but don’t get too comfortable. Only ten of you will officially join the national team. The five academies selected thirty students in total, so later on, twenty of you will be backup members. I hope each student from HMA can make the cut. So, work hard and don’t let us down.\"\nThe six students exchanged glances, then nodded earnestly at Kellan.\nSeeing their determined faces, Kellan finally smiled.\n\"Alright, you have today and tomorrow off. Meet at the school gate at 9 AM the day after tomorrow. Use these two days to say goodbye to your families. You’ll undergo six months of special training with no visits or holidays. That’s all I have to say. You’re dismissed.\" Kellan said, getting up with his two deputies to leave.\nAs he passed Arix, he gently patted her head.\n\"Arix, I’m heading out,\" Kellan said warmly.\n\"Okay, goodbye, Kellan,\" Arix replied, waving obediently.\nKellan smiled and nodded, then left with his deputies. President Gunder offered a few encouraging words before departing with the corps representatives.\nFinally, only the six students remained in the meeting room. They introduced themselves and started saying their goodbyes.\nRahan, the one who looked like a Persian cat, waved and said, \"I’m heading out first. See you the day after tomorrow.\"\n\"See you then,\" Dollan responded coolly, nodding before leaving.\nAfter saying goodbye to the new faces, Arix turned to Deanna and her brother. \"Deanna, what are your plans for the next two days?\"\nDeanna shook her head, looking a bit sad. \"We don’t have any family to say goodbye to. We’ll just stay in our room to avoid any trouble.\"\nMarceau patted his sister’s head comfortingly and nodded in agreement.\nArix thought for a moment, then asked, \"I’m going to Planet Waste for the next two days. Deanna, if you’re free, do you want to come with me?\"\nDeanna’s eyes lit up. \"Really? Can I come with you?\"\n\"Of course! The more, the merrier,\" Arix replied with a smile.\n\"Great! I’ll hang out with you for the next two days,\" Deanna said, excitedly hugging Arix’s arm.\n\"Alright, let’s go. Come home with me first. My mom will like you so much,\" Arix said happily, linking arms with Deanna and walking out. She completely forgot about Drexel behind her.\nDeanna, equally excited, linked arms with Arix and chatted away, forgetting about her brother too.\nThe two ignored brothers shared a look of bitterness. After a moment, Drexel put his arm around Marceau’s shoulder and laughed, \"Shall we go?\"\n\"Yeah, let’s go,\" Marceau replied, sounding more relaxed than usual.\nDrexel’s smile widened. Then, like good friends, they left the meeting room with their arms around each other’s shoulders.",

      "content": "Chapter 205: Back To Planet Waste\nWith little time on hand, Arix quickly took the Deanna siblings home for a short visit, then they left promptly, nudged along by Fleur’s reminders.\nThey boarded a spaceship bound for Planet Waste and arrived just before sunset.\nAs they stepped out of the transportation hall, Arix stood still, taking in the surrounding buildings with a bit of shock.\nShe remembered the first time she traveled to this spot, piles of garbage were everywhere, even near the hall.\nBut now, those stinky garbage mountains were gone, replaced by gleaming high-rise buildings.\n\"Arix, what’s up?\" Deanna asked, noticing Arix lost in thought.\n\"Nothing, just blown away by the changes. I remember garbage mountains here,\" Arix replied, scanning the area with a strange mix of nostalgia and surprise. It felt like coming home to a fully renovated house, almost making her think she was in the wrong place.\n\"Seriously, if you hadn’t said this was Planet Waste, I’d have thought it was a tourist spot,\" Deanna said, equally amazed.\n\"I might know why,\" Drexel said with a sly, proud smile.\n\"Hmm?\" Everyone, even the usually indifferent Marceau, turned to look at Drexel.\n\"This planet’s transformation has a lot to do with you, Arix,\" Drexel said, smiling at her.\n\"What?\" Arix was baffled. \"What does this have to do with me?\"\nWith everyone’s curious eyes on him, Drexel’s smile widened. Without dragging it out, he explained, \"Arix, you often underestimate yourself. You might not know it, but you’re a pretty big deal on this planet.\"\nArix felt goosebumps at the compliment. \"I like praise, but can we keep it real?\"\nDeanna, however, was all ears. \"Drexel, go on.\"\nFeeling slightly indignant that his sister doubted him, Drexel continued, \"I’m not exaggerating. First, you got into the military academy, then you created the psychic power healing potion. The key part is you stayed on this planet. So, some folks think this planet is lucky and decided to move here. As more people came, Planet Waste’s economy boomed, turning it into what you see now.\"\nArix thought Drexel’s explanation made some sense but still eyed him skeptically. \"Why do I feel like you’re spinning a tale?\"\nDrexel pretended to be helpless, spreading his hands and shrugging, \"Arix, whether you buy it or not, as your brother, I suggest you leave here right now.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" Arix asked, puzzled.\nBut in the next second, Arix understood Drexel’s warning. The crowd around them, who had been sneakily watching, seemed to confirm something and started to buzz with excitement.\n\"Isn’t that Arix?\"\n\"It’s her, definitely her. She looks just like on the interstellarnet.\"\n\"Arix is so beautiful, I want her autograph!\"\nThe noise from the crowd swelled, and they closed in on Arix, almost engulfing her. Shivering with fear, she quickly activated the invisibility mode on her bracelet, disappearing from sight.\n\"Hey, where did she go?\"\n\"Arix is gone!!\"\n\"Head to Sister Gwen’s orphanage! Arix will definitely go there.\"\nWith this suggestion, the entire spaceship hall emptied out in seconds, leaving only Deanna, Marceau, and Drexel behind, their clothes disheveled from the chaos.\nDeanna tidied her hair and sighed, \"Looks like Arix is really popular.\"\nDrexel laughed, \"You better get used to it. My sister is a star everywhere she goes.\"\nDeanna rolled her eyes at him and clung to Marceau’s arm. Drexel’s nonchalance about Arix’s sudden disappearance irked her. ’How can he be laughing at a time like this?’\nWorried about Arix, Deanna asked, \"Do you think Arix will be safe alone?\"\nMarceau furrowed his brows in concern, but Drexel seemed unfazed. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small, fluffy ball.\n\"What’s that?\" Deanna and her siblings stared at the little ball in confusion.\n\"This,\" Drexel said, rubbing his cheek against the small tiger, \"is my sister!\"\nArix, in her tiger form, let out a little roar, pushing Drexel’s face away with her paw.\nThe two siblings were astonished.\nWith a face now marked by tiny tiger scratches, Drexel grinned and pulled out a Lev. Leading the group, he said, \"Let’s head to the orphanage.\"\nInside the Lev, Deanna gently cradled Arix, her eyes sparkling with delight. \"Arix, you look so cute like this.\"\nThe little tiger lifted her chin proudly and let out a tiny roar. Deanna didn’t understand what Arix was saying but was completely charmed by her cuteness.\nFrom the front seat, Drexel glanced back and said, \"Arix, you’re cute, but not the cutest in the world.\"\nArix glared at Drexel with her round tiger eyes, her little fangs showing in anger.\nDeanna glared at Drexel too. \"Arix is the cutest! The cutest in the world!\"\nSeeing he had upset both of them, Drexel sighed and conceded, \"Alright, alright, she is the cutest in the world.\"\n\"Hmph!\" Both Arix and Deanna huffed in satisfaction, continuing to shower each other with praise.\nDrexel, shaking his head with a smile, focused on driving as the two girls chatted happily despite the language barrier.\nNot long after, they arrived at their destination.\nDrexel surveyed the dense crowd outside and didn’t open the car door right away. Instead, he turned to Arix and the others. \"Should we disguise ourselves before getting out to avoid being recognized?\"\nDeanna and Marceau exchanged a glance, still feeling uneasy. They looked back at Drexel and nodded in agreement.\n\"Arf?\" Arix lifted a paw, questioning.\nDrexel patted Arix’s small head. \"You don’t need a disguise. Just stay in this form for now.\"\n\"Arf,\" Arix nodded obediently.\nSoon, the three of them, wrapped up tightly and wearing large sunglasses, got out of the car, holding the small tiger.\nDrexel put away the Lev and motioned for them to move forward.\nDeanna and Marceau followed Drexel quietly to the entrance. Their suspicious behavior caught the attention of others, who thought it might be Arix. But when they realized there was no Arix, someone rolled their eyes. \"Why dress like that in broad daylight? I thought the Arix was here.\"\n\"Maybe they’re dressing like that to get Arix’s attention,\" a nearby lady said disdainfully.\n\"Darn it! So cunning,\" others around them said jealously.\nAmid the disdain of a group of Arix’s enthusiastic fans, Drexel and the others finally reached the orphanage entrance.\nThe guard, assuming they were more fans looking for Arix, waved them off impatiently. \"I’ve told you, Miss Arix isn’t here. How many times do I have to say it?\"\n\"Yes, yes, we know. We believe you,\" Drexel nodded agreeably.\nThe guard, surprised by Drexel’s compliance, looked at him more closely. \"Then why are you here? Let me make it clear, I won’t let you in.\"\n\"No need, we’re here to see Sister Gwen. We can go in ourselves,\" Drexel said while using Arix’s opticomputer to scan at the gate. The system recognized it, and the door opened, surprising the guard.\nDrexel nodded politely to the guard and led his companions inside.\nThe guard, bewildered, watched them go in. To be sure, he quickly pulled up the entry records on his opticomputer. What he saw was Arix’s name and photo.\n\"So, it was them,\" the guard muttered, putting away his opticomputer. He recalled that one of the wrapped figures seemed to be a girl, possibly Arix.\nBefore the guard could think more, the crowd outside, seeing Drexel and the others enter, erupted.\n\"Why can they go in, but we can’t?\"\n\"Yeah, they were dressed all sneaky too.\"\n\"We’re all fans. Why the special treatment?\"\nSeeing the fans starting to make noise again, the guard picked up a megaphone and shouted impatiently, \"Silence, silence! What are you yelling about? You still don’t get it? The one who just went in was Miss Arix. You can’t even recognize your own idol?\"\nAs soon as the guard finished speaking, the crowd fell into a dead silence. Then, exclamations of surprise erupted.\nInside the orphanage, Drexel led everyone to the director’s office and gently knocked on the door.\n\"Come in,\" a gentle and kind voice called out.\nWith a click, the door opened softly. Arix, nestled in Deanna’s arms, looked up excitedly. Sure enough, she saw Sister Gwen inside the room.",

      "content": "Chapter 206: Back Home\nSister Gwen was over sixty years old, with gray temples, a face full of wrinkles, and a pair of reading glasses perched on her nose.\n\"Who are you?\" Sister Gwen asked kindly, though she didn’t recognize the three young men in front of her.\n\"Arf!\" Arix flew out of Deanna’s arms. She transformed into human form mid-air, and pounced directly into Sister Gwen’s embrace.\n\"Sister Gwen, did you miss me?\" Arix rubbed her snowy white face against Sister Gwen’s arm affectionately.\nSister Gwen was stunned for a moment. Then, she touched Arix’s hair in disbelief and said, \"Arix, is it really you?\"\n\"It’s me,\" Arix said, looking up with a bright smile.\n\"Good, good.\" Sister Gwen held Arix’s little face excitedly, touching her repeatedly as if she couldn’t get enough.\nArix smiled warmly and let Sister Gwen stroke her, seemingly never getting tired of it.\nDeanna, watching the heartwarming scene, felt touched and a bit envious. She looked up at her brother and found Marceau looking down at her. Instantly, Deanna’s lips curved into a bright smile, and she reached out to hold his large hand.\nMarceau looked at Deanna with affection, then gently ruffled her hair.\nAfter Arix and Sister Gwen finished expressing their longing for each other, Sister Gwen remembered the three others standing nearby. She smiled and said, \"You must be Arix’s friends. Please, have a seat. There are some snacks on the table, help yourselves.\"\n\"Thank you, Sister Gwen,\" Drexel said seriously. Out of respect for an elder and gratitude for Sister Gwen’s care of Arix over the past ten years, Drexel’s respect for Sister Gwen was as strong as for his own grandfather.\nDeanna and Marceau also thanked her before sitting on the nearby couch.\nStill in Sister Gwen’s arms, Arix almost forgot to introduce everyone. She quickly got up and said, \"Sister Gwen, this is my second brother Drexel. These are my classmates Deanna and Marceau. Deanna, Marceau, this is Sister Gwen.\"\n\"Hello, Sister Gwen,\" the three of them said sweetly.\n\"You’re all sweet kids. You haven’t had dinner yet, have you? Come with me,\" Sister Gwen said with a happy smile.\n\"Okay, thank you, Sister Gwen,\" the four of them replied obediently and followed Sister Gwen to the dining hall.\nDuring dinner, Arix found herself surrounded by enthusiastic little fans.\nAll night long, she was busy hugging kids and handing out gifts. Even Drexel and the others made friends with many of the cute kids, which made their Space Button storage shrink significantly.\nThey stayed at the orphanage until the next morning before preparing to leave. When it was time to say goodbye, Arix clung to Sister Gwen, refusing to let go until Sister Gwen, pretending to be angry, gently pushed her into the Lev.\n\"I’ll come back to see you when I have time,\" Arix said, waving reluctantly from the car.\n\"Okay, go on now,\" Sister Gwen replied with a gentle smile.\n\"Goodbye, Sister Gwen.\" After the four of them said their goodbyes, the Lev started up.\nSister Gwen watched the car drive away, her gentle, smiling eyes gradually becoming more complicated.\nShe knew that the current Arix was not her Arix. Sister Gwen worried that the real Arix might have encountered danger or been harmed by this new one. But after spending the night together, she was certain that this Arix was also a kind child who would not harm her Arix.\nAs Sister Gwen stood there, feeling sad and worried, she suddenly received a message on her opticomputer. She was slightly stunned, then opened the message, and what she saw instantly brought tears to her eyes.\n\"Sister Gwen, worry not. The Arix you love has gone back home, back to her beloved family.\"\nIn the car, after sending this message, Arix put away the screen.\nShe had a feeling that Sister Gwen might have noticed something was off but didn’t want to believe it. So, she sent this message on impulse.\nIf she was wrong, Sister Gwen would just think she was talking about herself. If she was right, Sister Gwen would understand the hidden meaning.\nArix sighed slightly. Whether Sister Gwen understood or not, it was better than leaving her to guess wildly in the future. She wasn’t confident she could fool Sister Gwen, who had cared for Arix for ten years.\n\"Arix, what are you thinking about? Why do you look so worried?\" Deanna asked, concerned.\n\"Nothing, just feeling a bit sad and sorry,\" Arix smiled, making up an excuse. What was really in her mind wasn’t suitable for discussion now.\nFortunately, Deanna didn’t think much of it and assumed Arix simply didn’t want to leave the orphanage so soon.\nShe hugged Arix and said, \"It’s okay, I’ll come back with you next time.\"\n\"And me,\" Drexel said, turning his head briefly.\nMarceau also nodded. Arix felt warm inside and smiled gently, \"Thank you, everyone.\"\n\"No problem, we are partners, aren’t we?\" Deanna said, linking arms with Arix and smiling.\n\"Yes,\" Arix nodded with a smile.\n\"Arix, where are we going next?\" Drexel asked while driving the Lev.\n\"There’s a guy I need to visit. After that, we can go home. I’ve sent the address to your opticomputer,\" Arix said, sending the location to Drexel’s device.\n\"Got it, let’s go!\" Drexel glanced at the address, memorized it, and then sped up.\nSoon, they arrived near a junkyard.\n\"Arix, is this the place?\" Drexel asked uncertainly. All they saw were mountains of garbage, with no sign of livable houses around.\n\"Let me check,\" Arix said, leaning out the car window. Instead of finding the house, she spotted the person she was looking for being chased by several insectoids.\n\"Open the door now!\" Arix shouted anxiously.\n\"Oh! Okay, okay,\" Drexel quickly opened the Lev’s door.\n\"Arix, what’s happening?!\" Deanna asked, her hair blowing in the wind, her voice tense.\n\"The guy I’m looking for is in danger!\" Arix didn’t have time to explain. She transformed into her beast form, flapping her wings, and flew rapidly toward the man in peril.\n\"Arix!\"\n\"Arix!!\" Drexel gritted his teeth and turned Lev in the direction Arix flew.\nOn the other side, a middle-aged man was dragging his injured leg, stumbling through the junkyard, trying to escape. He occasionally picked up debris from the ground and threw it at the insectoids behind him to buy some time.\nUnfortunately, the debris was just that—debris. The insectoids easily sliced it in half with a flick of their forelimbs.\nCrax’s face was serious but not panicked. He remained calm, engaging in guerrilla warfare with the insectoids. He was a retired soldier from the Alliance, and he would never lose his edge.\nThe insectoids didn’t care if he was a retired soldier or not. They raised their sharp forelimbs and attacked the already heavily injured prey.\nCrax twisted his waist, narrowly dodging the attack. The intense movement worsened his leg injury. He groaned, biting back the pain, and got up to run again.\nBut the continuous bleeding from his leg made his body heavier, and his vision started to blur. He tripped over some garbage and fell heavily to the ground. Despite this, he gritted his teeth and struggled to get up.\nHe couldn’t fall now, as he hadn’t delivered the message about the insectoid attack to the Fifth Legion.\nCrax bit his lip until it bled, desperately trying to crawl forward. But while he fought against himself, he couldn’t outrun the insectoids chasing him. The reality of being unable to escape dealt him a fatal blow.\nThe sharp limb of an insectoid pierced through his abdomen, and a torrent of blood instantly dyed his stomach red, staining the filthy, stinking ground.",

      "content": "Chapter 207: Going Against Insectoids\nThe insectoid screeched, excitement evident as it lifted Crax high, ready to feast.\n\"Roar!\" A tiger’s roar, filled with fury and sorrow, echoed through the junkyard. A streak of white light zipped across the distance, and in a flash, the insectoid’s limb holding Crax was severed by Arix’s swift claw.\nArix quickly shifted into his human form, catching Crax as he fell.\n\"Who... who are you?\" Crax struggled to lift his head, trying to make out Arix through his blood-drenched vision. He coughed up more blood, his strength fading fast.\nBefore Arix could respond, Crax’s eyes widened. \"Watch out!\" he shouted, but then he saw it was unnecessary. A psychic power shield enveloped them both, blocking the insectoid’s attacks.\n\"Uncle Crax, it’s me, Arix. Stay still; I’ll heal your wounds.\" Arix formed a psychic sword and cut off the remaining insectoid limb from Crax’s wound.\nAs she moved to help, Crax grabbed her wrist. \"Forget about me now. You need to alert the Fifth Legion now! The insectoids... they’re planning to attack Planet Waste. They’ve set up three wormhole passages ten kilometers ahead.\"\nRecognizing Arix, Crax relaxed a bit, panting as he explained.\nArix’s heart raced. One wormhole was bad enough, but three? She quickly used her opticomputer to call his grandfather.\n\"Arix, what’s wrong? Are you hurt?\" Matis answered, initially casual but then alarmed by the sight of the insectoid and injured Crax.\n\"I’m on Planet Waste. This retired soldier, Thaul Crax, says the insectoids are about to attack. They’ve established three wormhole passages here,\" Arix reported, keeping her voice steady.\nMatis’s expression grew serious. One wormhole was manageable, typically handled with an Ether Crystal. But three at once? That was new territory. If they couldn’t be closed in time, Planet Waste would be overrun, its inhabitants doomed to become insectoid food.\nUnderstanding the gravity, Matis instructed urgently, \"Arix, stay safe. I’ll send reinforcements right away.\"\n\"Okay,\" Arix nodded, equally serious.\n\"Take care,\" Matis said, worry evident before ending the call.\nWith the message sent, Crax finally allowed himself to relax, slipping into unconsciousness.\n\"Uncle Crax!\" Arix cried, seeing Crax near death. She didn’t waste a second, starting surgery to clean and tend to the wounds.\nAt this moment, Drexel and the others arrived. The three of them tacitly avoided disturbing Arix. Instead, they launched a swift counterattack against the insectoids.\nIn no time, Drexel and his team, with their overwhelming power, easily took down the few arrogant insectoids.\n\"Arix, what happened? Who is this person?\" Drexel asked, putting away his psychic power spear, which still dripped with insectoid blood.\nArix deactivated the psychic power shield.\nWhile continuing to treat Crax, she explained to Drexel and the others, \"This is Uncle Crax, the one who wrote the HMA recommendation letter for me. Drexel, go tell the governor of this planet. The insectoids have already established three wormhole passages ten kilometers ahead. They could attack at any moment.\"\n\"Got it! I’ll handle it!\" Drexel responded. He immediately used his family privileges to contact the governor of Planet Waste.\nThe governor, who had already received a notification from the Fifth Legion, felt like passing out when he learned that Drexel and his team were also on the scene.\nInitially, he managed to stay calm about the insectoid ambush. But now, with Drexel and Arix Kering also involved, he was nearly terrified out of his wits.\nIf anything happened to Arix, he didn’t even know how to explain it to the higher-ups and the people of the Alliance.\nDespite his inner turmoil, the governor immediately dispatched troops to support Arix and her team. He specifically instructed the rescue troops to ensure the safety of everyone.\nAfter arranging support for Arix, the governor and the Rear Admiral stationed on Planet Waste began to prepare all pre-battle measures.\nFirst, they activated the energy shields over all cities on Planet Waste. This was the last line of defense against the insectoid invasion.\nNext, they ordered all Alliance citizens on the planet to take shelter in military bunkers.\nFinally, the governor commanded all military units to form a defensive perimeter to stop the insectoids from invading through the three wormholes.\nClear and precise orders were rapidly transmitted from the combat command center. Suddenly, all cities on Planet Waste sounded alarms for an insectoid attack.\nHearing the alarms, the ordinary people of Planet Waste fell into panic and chaos. Luckily, when soldiers and police officers with loudspeakers began guiding the crowds, people started to calm down and follow the evacuation procedures.\n...\nAs the city alarms rang out, Arix carefully placed Crax, now safe, onto the Lev. She set the destination to the orphanage and let the Lev take off on autopilot.\nOnce Crax was securely on his way, the four young fighters nodded to each other without hesitation, each summoning their Supergiant-Class mecha.\n\"Didn’t think renting these Supergiant-Class mechas from school just in case would actually pay off,\" Deanna said, laughing bitterly.\n\"Deanna, Marceau, if we manage to save Planet Waste, I’ll push for you both to get rights to two Supergiant-Class mechas from the military. Plus, I’ll cover the repairing fee of any damage to these mechas,\" Arix said, knowing their situation and making an appealing offer.\nHaving usage rights meant all damages on the mehcas, except for intentional ones, would be covered by the military, and there would be no rental fees. They would only return the mechas once they got their own Supergiant-Class units.\nMarceau and Deanna nearly jumped up when they heard the offer.\nEven Marceau couldn’t keep his cool.\nDeanna jumped up, excitedly asking, \"Arix, you promise?\"\nDeanna and Marceau had been stressed because they couldn’t compete without mechas. They could rent from the military academy, but the costs were too high. If they got the military’s Supergiant-Class mecha usage rights, it would solve a huge problem for them.\nArix nodded firmly. If the military didn’t agree, she could use her merit points to get the usage rights for Deanna and Marceau. She had plenty of points anyway.\nSeeing Arix’s confirmation, Deanna was overjoyed. She quickly jumped into her cockpit and shouted in the channel, \"What are we waiting for? Let’s go!\"\nArix smiled and was about to climb into her mecha when Drexel, standing nearby, winked and said, \"Arix, what about me?\"\nArix’s smile vanished, replaced with a forced grin, \"Leave, now.\"\nIgnoring Drexel, she got into her Star Dust.\nDrexel pouted and mumbled, \"No need to be so fierce, you’re becoming more like a tigress.\"\nAlready in her cockpit, Arix saw Drexel still standing there and angrily shouted, \"What are you waiting for?\"\nDrexel, scared, quickly got into Blue Raven and followed the others.",

      "content": "Chapter 208: Join The Fight\nAbout five kilometers from the wormhole, they were stopped by the stationed army of Planet Waste.\n\"There’s an insectoid wave ahead. Everyone not from the corps, turn back and head to the shelters immediately,\" the Alliance captain, leading the army in his mecha, blocked the four Supergiant-Class mechas.\nIf these mechas could help fight the insectoids, their chances of winning would be much higher. But since they weren’t part of the Alliance corps, even the captain couldn’t let them pass without permission.\nThe four of them, not expecting to be stopped, exchanged confused glances.\n\"What do we do now?\" Arix asked through her earpiece in their mecha squad channel.\n\"No big deal, I’ll talk to him,\" Drexel said, pressing the external voice button.\nHe then addressed the captain, \"Sir, we are HMA military students. It’s our duty to fight, especially in such an urgent situation. I don’t see any need to keep us away from this, right?\"\nThe captain nodded, but quickly shook his head, \"Since you are military students, you’re like my juniors. I can’t let you take such risks. You should go back.\"\nAfter another round of back and forth, the guy still refused to let them through.\n\"Let me try,\" Arix interrupted.\n\"Sure, give it a shot,\" Drexel said, feeling exasperated with the stubborn man.\nArix cleared her throat to get everyone’s attention before speaking, \"Sir, we need to get in there.\"\nDrexel: ...\n’How’s that better than mine?’\nThe officer, annoyed by their persistence, firmly replied, \"I said no. Go back immediately!\"\nArix remained calm and said, \"We are Supergiant-Class mecha pilots.\"\nThe captain hesitated.\nSeeing a chance, Arix raised an eyebrow and continued, \"We are four Supergiant-Class mecha pilots.\"\nThe captain wavered.\nArix delivered the final blow, \"We are soldiers with four Supergiant-Class mechas.\"\n\"Stop, stop! I’ll ask my superior!\" the captain exclaimed, overwhelmed.\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Arix said innocently, blinking her eyes.\nSighing and shaking his head, the captain reported the situation to his superior, the Rear Admiral in charge of Planet Waste.\nThe Rear Admiral, hearing about four Supergiant-Class mecha pilots, agreed without hesitation.\nOnly a fool would refuse!\nWith orders from his superior, the captain had no reason to refuse. After registering their information, he waved them through.\nOverjoyed, the four nodded to each other and piloted their mechas into the wormhole’s danger zone.\n...\nIn the command room, Elion, the Overseer of Planet Waste, spotted Sylar, the Rear Admiral, grinning from ear to ear.\nCurious, Elion asked, \"What’s got you so cheerful?\"\n\"Oh, it’s a good thing. Some military students just volunteered to help within the wormhole’s guard range. Four Supergiant-Class mecha pilots, can you believe that? They were so enthusiastic, I couldn’t say no,\" Sylar said, his smile widening with pride.\nElion’s heart sank.\n’Military students? Oh no! Are they those military students I just heard about?’\n\"Sylar, send me the info on those four military students, now,\" Elion demanded urgently, a sense of dread washing over him.\n\"What’s wrong? Why are you so worked up?\" Sylar asked, puzzled, but he still sent the information over.\nElion didn’t have time to explain. He opened the data and nearly fell off his chair.\nSylar panicked, seeing Elion slump lifelessly in his chair. He grabbed Elion’s shoulders and shook him hard. \"Hey, Elion, say something. Just tell me what is going on, OK? You’re scaring me a bit.\"\nAlready overwhelmed with worry and now being shaken violently, Elion had had enough. He punched the thick-headed Sylar.\nHolding his head, Sylar looked pitiful. \"Why did you hit me?\"\n\"Why did you let those troublemakers in?\" Elion snapped, more upset than ever.\nSylar was clueless.\n\"What’s so bad about letting in a few military students? They need to face those insectoids eventually,\" Sylar said, feeling misunderstood.\nElion sighed deeply. \"Those military students include the future admiral of the Fifth Legion and the Alliance’s future hope, Drexel and Arix Kering. If anything happens to them, are you sure you can handle the consequences?\"\nSylar’s expression froze as if struck by lightning.\nAfter a moment, he reacted, looking devastated. He hugged Elion’s leg and cried, \"Elion, save me!\"\nElion laughed coldly, feeling utterly helpless. \"I’m exhausted. Let’s just face the end.\"\n\"No, we can still fix this!\" Sylar cried, looking desperate.\nElion glanced at the pitiful Sylar and sighed deeply. \"Since we can’t pull them out now, inform your soldiers to protect those kids well.\"\nSylar desperately wanted to pull those troublemakers out, but after some thought, he realized there was no better option. With a heavy sigh, he relayed the order to his subordinates.\nMeanwhile, Arix and the others were stunned as soon as they entered the wormhole’s guard range.\nThe sight of the massive insectoid swarm and the fierce battle between humans and insectoids was overwhelming. Thousands of military mechas clashed with the surrounding insectoids.\nIt seemed like the military was holding its ground, successfully stopping the insectoids from spreading.\nHowever, the insectoids also kept the military mechas from approaching the wormhole. If the three central wormholes continued producing insectoids, the military’s hope of holding Planet Waste would grow slimmer by the minute.\nThe lead combat commander was all too aware of this. They had just one Ether Crystal, not enough to close all the wormholes. But closing even one wormhole could increase their chances of winning by over 20%.\nThe problem was the insectoids were guarding the wormholes fiercely. They couldn’t break through the outer defenses, let alone get close to the wormholes.\n\"Damn it, if only we had a few Supergiant-Class mecha pilots right now,\" the commander muttered, glaring at the wormholes with a mix of anger and helplessness.\nThe Alliance was vast, with most Supergiant-Class mecha pilots stationed on the front lines or protecting important planets. Planet Waste’s best pilot was only Subgiant-Class, and they were already grateful for that. The insectoids likely exploited this weakness, choosing to attack Planet Waste.\nIf the commander were a Supergiant-Class mecha pilot, he would have fought these insectoids himself.\nAs his despair grew, a request from an unfamiliar mecha channel came in, asking to join the military mecha channel.\nThe commander, hoping for reinforcements, approved the request.\n\"Hello, sir. We are Supergiant-Class mecha pilots requesting to join the battle,\" Drexel said seriously over the radio. He knew that if the battle dragged on, Planet Waste would soon fall.\nThe commander was stunned for a moment, thinking he misheard. \"Supergiant-Class mecha pilots?\" he asked, incredulous.\n’Really, exactly what I’m needing now?’",

      "content": "Chapter 209: A Disaster\nDrexel couldn’t quite read the commander’s thoughts. Thinking the man might not have heard him, he repeated himself with more conviction, \"Yes, we are Supergiant-Class mecha pilots, and there are four of us.\"\n\"Perfect timing!\" the commander exclaimed. \"I have a critical mission for you. You need to take this Ether Crystal and send it through one of the wormholes. It’s a tough assignment, but for the sake of the Alliance people on Planet Waste, we must ask for your help.\"\n\"Understood! We will complete the mission!\" Drexel responded with a firm salute.\nThe commander returned the salute with equal seriousness. \"On behalf of Planet Waste, thank you.\"\nSwitching back to his team’s channel, Drexel relayed the mission and its risks to Deanna and the others.\nThey all nodded in agreement without hesitation. Drexel felt a surge of pride. He then went to the commander alone to retrieve the Ether Crystal.\nWith the crystal in hand, Drexel regrouped with his team to plan the operation.\n\"Arix, you’ll take the Ether Crystal and seal the wormhole,\" he said, handing it to Arix.\nArix accepted the crystal with a resolute nod.\nWith the main task assigned, Drexel continued, \"I’ll lead the charge. Deanna and Marceau, you two will support Arix. If there are no questions, let’s move out.\"\nOnce everyone knew their roles, Drexel’s mecha extended a hand, looking up at the other three.\nArix placed his mecha’s hand firmly on Drexel’s, followed by Deanna and Marceau, who exchanged a look before joining in.\nTogether, they nodded in encouragement. Then, with a synchronized motion, they raised their hands and swung them down forcefully, charging into the swarm of insectoids without a second thought.\nIn the thick of the battle, they advanced in a tight triangular formation. Drexel spearheaded the attack, his long spear slicing through foes.\nDeanna and Marceau covered the sides, fending off and eliminating insectoids.\nIn the middle, Arix stayed vigilant, ready to assist if any of his teammates faltered.\nOther mecha pilots on the battlefield noticed their prowess.\n\"Wow, are those Supergiant-Class mecha pilots? Their power is insane!\"\n\"Who are they? I’ve never seen these mechas in our legion.\"\n\"I think I recognize those mechas on the sides. They can be rented from Hecaris Military Academy, usually by military students.\"\n\"So, they’re just students?\"\nAlliance soldiers watched in awe, guessing their identities.\nThe commander, now more relaxed with Arix and the team handling the crystal, didn’t care if they were students or not.\nDuring times of great disaster, even the very young ones have to step up. Especially military students, who are the future soldiers of the Alliance. When the people of the Alliance are in trouble, they must act without hesitation.\nAs the commander finished this thought, a message from his superior popped up on his opticomputer. Worried it might be important, he quickly opened it. The first line made his stomach drop.\nHe muttered as he read, \"Two of those military students were from the Kering family and needed protection? In times like these, should we really treat the children of high-ranking officers differently? Were the kids on Planet Waste any less valuable?\"\nFrowning, he read on.\nThe boy is Drexel, the future leader of the Fifth Legion.\nThe commander’s heart skipped a beat. While he believed all lives were equal, sending a young genius to die seemed foolish.\nHis eyelids twitched as he continued reading.\nThe girl is Arix. Protect her at all costs and stop her from going to the battlefield if necessary!\nThe commander was stunned. The words echoed in his mind. Arix? Arix Kering?\nIf Drexel’s involvement worried him about exposing a future leader too soon, Arix’s presence made him regret his decisions deeply.\nArix, who invented the healing potion that saved countless lives across the stars, including his own comrades. He had just given the most dangerous task to the future hope of the Alliance.\nHe realized that he had to fix this mistake.\nThe commander buried his face in his hands, feeling crushed for a few seconds. When he looked up again, there was a glint of madness in his eyes. Determined, he pressed his wireless earpiece and addressed all the mecha teams.\n\"Everyone, I have good news and bad news.\"\nThe military mecha teams were puzzled but listened attentively to their commander’s unusual tone.\nThe commander took a deep breath and said, \"You all know Arix Kering, right?\"\nThe mecha teams wondered if their commander had lost his mind. Everyone in the Alliance military knew Arix’s name. Without her, the death and injury rates would be at least 10% higher.\nThanks to Arix’s invention of the psychic power healing potion, their comrades’ chances of survival had significantly increased.\nNow, that 10% might seem small, but for the Alliance Army, which has billions of soldiers, it means saving millions of lives.\nArix came from Planet Waste, so some soldiers from there saw her almost like a savior.\nThe commander knew it was a silly question, so he skipped it and went straight to the point. \"Arix is here, and she’s on-site.\"\nWhen the soldiers heard this, they were shocked, surprised, and overjoyed. Some even started thinking about getting her autograph after the battle.\nBut before they could bask in that thought, the commander dropped some bad news.\n\"See those four Supergiant-Class mechas? Arix is in one of them. I thought they were support from another corps, so I assigned them the most dangerous mission to seal the wormhole. That was my mistake. After the war, I’ll accept the punishment. For now, protect them!\"\nThe battlefield went silent for a few seconds after he spoke. Then, curses filled the air.\nIn those few moments, the battlefield’s atmosphere shifted. Every mecha squad fought like they were insane, their combat power skyrocketing.\nThey had one goal: to kill all these insectoids and keep Arix safe. And after the battle, they’d definitely make that commander pay.\nMeanwhile, as Arix and her team got closer to the wormhole, the insectoids went wild. They had been scattered at first, but now they were swarming like they had received orders.\nThe sky was nearly black with the insectoid army. Drexel had to call in Sheer, but the endless stream of enemies left them exhausted.\nDeanna and Marceau’s mechas were covered in scratches and bite marks. Even Arix had to join the fight; the three of them couldn’t hold out much longer.\nThe wormhole was only 100 meters away, but they couldn’t get any closer. The longer they took, the more insectoids showed up. Drexel and his team were getting pushed back.",

      "content": "Chapter 210: Proctecting Arix\nJust when it seemed like they couldn’t hold on, the military mecha squads went into overdrive. They fought like true fans seeing their idol attacked, fueled by rage and determination.\nTheir fierce attacks forced the insectoids to split their focus and deal with the squads behind them.\n\"What’s going on? Why are the military guys acting like they’re on steroids?\" Deanna panted, wiping sweat from her forehead, eyes wide with curiosity.\n\"No matter the reason, this is our chance! Arix, it’s up to you!\" Drexel shouted, pouring all his psychic power into his spear. With gritted teeth, he swung it with all his might, creating a hundred-meter-long energy blade that slashed through the last 100 meters to the wormhole.\n\"Got it!\" Arix replied firmly. Star Dust followed right behind the energy blade, moving together like a dawn ray cutting through darkness, casting a bright yellow light that dispelled the gloom and filth.\nThis moment would be remembered for years as breathtakingly beautiful.\nThe military mecha squads, witnessing this terrifying strike from afar, were also shocked. If they hadn’t known these were just military students, they might have mistaken them for seasoned commanders. Only such veterans could possess such incredible strength.\nBut Drexel, having spent all his energy, couldn’t see this. After swinging his spear, he spat out a mouthful of blood and fell unconscious. Without its pilot, Blue Raven began to plummet from the sky.\nDeanna quickly caught Drexel while fending off attacking insectoids, casting hopeful glances toward Star Dust following the energy blade.\n\"Arix, you can do it!\"\nArix herself was struggling, gritting her teeth and desperately following the energy blade. In front of her was her brother’s all-out attack, and in her hands, the Ether Crystal, the future and hope of Planet Waste. She couldn’t afford to slow down, fearing the insectoids would overrun her, wasting her brother’s efforts.\nJust before the energy blade vanished, Arix mustered all her strength and leaped forward, finally sending the Ether Crystal into the wormhole.\nInstantly, the wormhole, which had been sucking everything in, paused for a few seconds like a jammed machine. Then it started to reverse, the opening visibly shrinking.\nArix watched the wormhole gradually close and finally smiled with relief.\nThey did it! Her brother’s efforts weren’t in vain!\nBut her joy was short-lived as a bitter smile appeared on her face. She wasn’t sure if she could get back, because she was completely exhausted.\nArix swallowed hard and looked behind her in despair. Countless vicious insectoids were swarming towards her.\n\"Arix!\"\nThe scream echoed through the air as panic gripped everyone.\nPeople charged towards Arix, looking frantic.\nDrexel, the siblings, and the military mecha team were too far to help. They could only watch helplessly as a swarm of insectoids overwhelmed Arix’s mecha.\n\"Arix!\" Deanna cried out, her voice filled with despair.\nIn moments of sheer desperation, memories can flood in. Deanna’s mind raced through all the times she had shared with Arix.\n\"Need some help? Looks like someone’s trying to shake you down.\"\n\"Don’t judge others until you’ve walked in their shoes. They’re classmates and future comrades at the military academy. Only the weak turn against their own. Are you weak?\"\n\"I’m heading to Planet Waste for a few days. Wanna come along, Deanna?\"\n\"That’s all behind us now. I know Deanna will find happiness in the future.\"\n’Why does Arix have to be the one to sacrifice himself?’\nRegret gnawed at Deanna. She shouldn’t have let him get involved in this chaos. She shouldn’t have given him and Drexel the chance to throw themselves into danger for others.\nDeanna didn’t want to be a hero. She just wanted her friends alive. \"Arix! You can’t die! You can’t!\"\nDeanna, with her brother, sprinted towards where Arix was buried under the swarm of insectoids. Her eyes were red with fury as she screamed, \"Arix!! Come back! Do you hear me? Come back!\"\nSuddenly, a small furry creature burst from the mass of insects. Though tiny, she immediately caught Deanna’s attention. She froze for a moment, then, filled with joy, handed Drexel to her brother and dashed towards Arix.\n\"Arix! Over here!\" she yelled.\nArix heard her and, with a final burst of energy, ran towards her.\nJust as the insectoids were about to catch up, Arix leapt into Deanna’s mecha’s arms.\nExhausted, Arix passed out, feeling safe at last.\nDeanna held Arix tightly, not caring about anything else, and started running towards the military.\nSeeing his sister carrying Arix, Marceau sighed with relief and followed, carrying Drexel.\nWith Deanna holding Arix and Marceau carrying Drexel, they both ran desperately towards the military, insectoids hot on their heels.\nThough not as strong in combat as Arix, Deanna and Marceau were faster runners. With the support of the military mecha team, they soon found themselves safely surrounded.\nOnce they were finally safe, Deanna and Marceau let themselves relax.\nCrawling out of the mecha cockpit, they collapsed on the ground, breathing heavily.\nIt took a moment before Deanna and Marceau had the strength to look at what they were holding.\nIn their arms, they each cradled an unconscious furball. Deanna held Arix, and Marceau held Drexel.\nChecking that both were safe, they sighed in relief. They exchanged smiles, feeling both fortunate and relieved.\nThe two finally succumbed to exhaustion and fell unconscious too.\nWhen Arix came to, she found herself in a hospital room. Propping herself up on her elbows, she looked around.\nDrexel and Deanna were still asleep in neighboring beds.\nArix didn’t want to disturb them, so she quietly got up and checked on their conditions, ensuring they were okay before stepping out of the room.\nAs she expected, two Alliance soldiers stood guard at the door. Upon seeing Arix, they immediately saluted. One of them asked quietly, \"Miss Kering, you’re awake. How are you feeling?\"\n\"I’m fine now. How’s the wormhole now? Is everyone on Planet Waste safe now?\" Arix asked, her voice filled with hope and worry.\nThough they had sealed one wormhole, two more remained. Given Planet Waste’s limited military strength, the cost of stopping the remaining wormholes could be high.\nThe soldiers exchanged glances. The taller one replied gratefully, \"Miss Arix, don’t worry. Aside from the usual casualties, the cost was quite small this time. Thanks to you four sealing one wormhole, we were able to hold out until the Fifth Legion arrived.\"\n\"Really? That’s great. Thank you for letting me know.\" Arix relaxed and smiled, relieved by the news. After a few more pleasantries, she said goodbye and returned to her bed. She played with her opticomputer, waiting for her friends to wake up.\nBefore her friends stirred, Kellan arrived, looking very upset.",

      "content": "Chapter 211: Mysterious Card\nAs Arix looked at Kellan, his face twisted in anger, she didn’t need any clues—she knew Kellan had discovered everything.\nAt that moment, Arix felt that the Kellan standing before her, smiling but furious, was way scarier than the insectoid they had fought earlier. Terrified, she hesitated to speak. Her lips quivered as she carefully said, \"Kellan, can we please talk this out? Please don’t be mad at me, okay?\"\nKellan narrowed his eyes and let out a cold laugh. He then reached out and pinched Arix’s cheeks with both hands, saying, \"Now you’re scared? Where was all that bravery when you jumped through the wormhole?\"\nWith her cheeks squeezed, Arix mumbled pitifully, \"Big Bwo... I’m sowwy... I won’t do it again...\"\nLuckily for Arix, Kellan didn’t have the heart to keep teasing her. After a sharp snort, he released her cheeks and said, \"If you ever try something like that again, I’ll make sure you get grounded.\"\n\"I won’t, I won’t,\" Arix quickly nodded, clutching her sore cheeks with both hands, terrified Kellan might start up again.\nFinally satisfied, Kellan gave Arix a pat on the head. Then, he turned his attention to the three beds nearby, his expression a mix of amusement and annoyance. \"Stop pretending to be asleep. If you’re awake, get up. Especially you, Drexel—your eyes are open! Are you trying to make it obvious you’re awake?\"\nAs soon as Kellan spoke, Deanna and Drexel, who had been lying on the beds, awkwardly sat up. Drexel, feeling the heat of embarrassment, coughed and asked, \"Kellan, what brings you here?\"\nIt was only then that Arix realized all three of them had been awake the entire time. So, they had just been watching her get scolded by Kellan.\nArix glared at the trio, her eyes full of betrayal. \"Don’t you feel even a bit guilty for throwing me under the bus like that?\"\nDrexel noticed the accusatory look from his sister, but compared to their terrifying big brother, throwing Arix under the bus seemed like the safer bet. He felt a twinge of guilt, but he knew there was no way he could stand up to Kellan. Besides, the worst Arix had to deal with was a little cheek-pinching, but if Kellan turned on him, Drexel knew he’d be in for way worse.\nAnd as if to prove Drexel’s point, Kellan didn’t disappoint. He landed a solid knock on Drexel’s head.\n\"Ouch, ouch, ouch! Kellan, I’m sorry! I won’t do it again!\" Drexel cried out in pain, apologizing loudly before Kellan could even say a word, hoping for some mercy.\nHis exaggerated yelps were so over-the-top that anyone who didn’t know the situation might think Drexel was being seriously mistreated.\nTake, for example, the two Alliance soldiers stationed outside the door. They immediately jumped to conclusions and earnestly began advising, \"Sir, please, let’s talk this over calmly. They’re just kids—violence won’t solve anything.\"\n\"Yes, sir, it’s the interstellar era now. That old-fashioned parenting style is outdated,\" the other soldier added, nervously trying to persuade Kellan.\nKellan first shot an annoyed glare at Drexel, then replied to the soldiers outside in a calm tone, \"Thank you, I’ve got it under control.\"\nAfter calming the Alliance soldiers outside, Kellan decided to let his overly dramatic younger brother off the hook. He shook his head and walked over to where the Deanna siblings were sitting.\nDrexel, having narrowly avoided further trouble, instantly stopped his fake cries and made a cheeky face behind Kellan’s back.\nArix, rolling her eyes at her childish brother, turned her curious gaze toward Deanna.\n’What’s Kellan planning now? Is he going to give Deanna and Marceau the same \"affectionate\" treatment we just received?’\nExcited by the possibility, Arix raised her eyebrows and let a mischievous grin spread across her face. She even stretched her neck a little, eager to see the drama unfold.\nBut to her surprise—and disappointment—Kellan didn’t scold Deanna and Marceau at all. Instead, he smiled warmly and spoke in a gentle tone, \"You must be Deanna and Marceau. I want to thank you for saving my troublesome sister and brother. On behalf of the Kering family, I give you my sincere gratitude.\"\n\"No big deal, sir. We did what we should,\" Marceau replied in his usual cool, detached manner.\n\"You’re too kind, really. It was just our duty,\" Deanna quickly responded, waving her hand with an awkward and slightly nervous smile.\nAfter witnessing how Kellan treated his siblings, Deanna found Kellan a bit intimidating.\nKellan, unaware of Deanna’s nervousness, assumed they were just being modest. After expressing his gratitude, he casually took out two cards from his Space Button and handed them to the bewildered Deanna and Marceau.\n\"Kellan, are these... what I think they are?\" Deanna asked, her voice tinged with disbelief as she began to understand what the cards meant.\nKellan looked at the young girl, who was around the same age as Arix, and thought about the tough times these siblings had likely faced. His tone softened as he replied, \"Yes, they are.\"\nBut instead of being thrilled, Deanna silently touched the card, then resolutely handed it back, saying, \"Thank you, but this card is too valuable. You should take it back.\"\nMarceau, following Deanna’s lead, quietly returned the card as well, without saying a word.\nKellan was taken aback by how quickly they gave the cards back. He knew these cards were worth as much as two Supergiant-Class mechas, something that would be incredibly valuable to the siblings. Yet, they weren’t swayed by temptation and returned them without a second thought.\n...\nWhen Kellan confirmed that Deanna and Marceau weren’t just being polite, he fell in silence for a while.\nKellan didn’t rush to take back the cards. Instead, in a brotherly way, he reached out and gently patted their heads. With a sigh that carried a touch of sadness, he said, \"Keep them. These aren’t from me. They’re from the military.\"\n\"The military?\"\nDeanna and Marceau exchanged confused looks, then turned back to Kellan, clearly puzzled.\nKellan nodded, but the confusion only deepened. They knew that helping stop the insectoid invasion on Planet Waste would earn them some merit points, but nowhere near enough to snag two official Alliance identity cards.\nIf they were regular folks trying to immigrate to the Alliance, maybe those points would’ve cut it. But coming from Planet Void? They’d need at least 5 million merit points each to get those cards. Together, that meant a whopping 10 million points.\nEven stopping the insectoid invasion would only bring in a few hundred thousand, maybe a million tops.\nNo matter how they sliced it, they couldn’t wrap their heads around why the military would hand over two identity cards worth that much.\nDeanna, being the more outgoing of the two, looked up at Kellan, confusion clear on her face. \"My brother and I didn’t do anything special. Do you know why the military gave us these identity cards?\"\nKellan just smiled and didn’t answer. Instead, he glanced over at Arix. That one look made everyone in the room shift their gaze toward Arix too.\nArix was caught off guard.\n\"Me? What does this have to do with me?\" Arix, who’d been quietly observing, suddenly found himself in the spotlight, pointing at herself in surprise.\nSeeing Arix’s bewildered expression, Kellan’s smile grew wider. He explained, \"Because you saved Arix.\"\nThe room fell into stunned silence. Even Arix, still pointing at herself, asked in disbelief, \"I’m worth that much? Saving me is worth 10 million merit points?\"\n\"Yep,\" Kellan replied, a rare playful tone in his voice.",

      "content": "Chapter 212: Adoption\nShock rippled through the room. Drexel, unable to resist a joke, said, \"Arix, next time you’re in danger, let me save you first. We can split the merit points.\"\nBefore Arix could shoot him a fierce look, Kellan used his psychic power to give Drexel a solid thump on the head.\n\"Ouch, ouch, ouch! That hurts! Kellan, I was just kidding! I’d never actually put Arix in danger,\" Drexel whined, rubbing the sore spot.\nKellan rolled his eyes at his troublesome brother but let it slide. Turning back to Deanna and Marceau, he asked, \"So, will you accept them now?\"\nDeanna, still reeling from the news, hesitated for a moment. But realizing how valuable those identity cards were and not wanting to risk Kellan changing his mind, she quickly accepted them. She didn’t fully understand why Arix worth so much, but she wasn’t about to argue with the gift.\nKellan watched with a smirk as Deanna, who had been so hesitant earlier, now clutched the identity cards like they were her lifeline, almost as if someone might snatch them away.\nShaking his head with a playful smile, Kellan asked, \"Now that you’ve got the identity cards, you’ll need a guardian since you’re both under-age. Got anyone in mind?\"\nDeanna immediately turned to Marceau. Technically, Marceau could be her guardian, but since he was only 17, he didn’t meet the Alliance’s requirement of being 20 to be considered an adult. So, he couldn’t officially take on the role.\nHonestly, Deanna was kind of relieved. If Marceau became her guardian, he’d have way too much control over her, and that would mean some of her more mischievous plans might get shut down before they even got started.\nHowever, in special cases, a minor could be allowed to become a guardian—like if they had been the primary caregiver for at least ten years. Given that Marceau had been looking after Deanna since she was born, his chances of being approved as her guardian were pretty high.\nWorried that Marceau might actually offer himself up for the job, Deanna quickly asked Kellan, \"Can we just not have a guardian? We’ve never really had one anyway.\"\n\"Nope, minors must have a guardian,\" Kellan replied, shutting down her idea without hesitation.\nDeanna was at a loss for words. She had a few choice ones in mind but bit her tongue. The idea of having a guardian made her want to growl in frustration.\nKellan, oblivious to her inner turmoil, assumed the siblings were just stumped on who could take on the role. Being the helpful guy he was, he decided to step in and made a suggestion. \"I actually know someone who could be your guardian. Would you be okay with that?\"\n\"Yes! Absolutely!\" Deanna blurted out before he could even finish, not caring in the slightest who the guardian was, just so long as it wasn’t Marceau. Her enthusiasm caught Marceau off guard, and he gave his sister a puzzled look.\nBut Deanna didn’t care if she seemed a little too eager. As long as it wasn’t Marceau, she didn’t care if a complete stranger—or even a cat—took on the role. Besides, if things didn’t work out, she could always cut ties once she turned 20.\nSeeing Deanna’s enthusiasm and Marceau’s lack of objection, Kellan’s smile grew even wider. \"Great! From now on, you’ll be my cousins.\"\nDeanna and Marceau were both puzzled.\nThey were both completely floored by this sudden declaration of family ties.\nWhen Kellan mentioned Marlone, Arix’s curiosity piqued. She asked, \"Kellan, do you mean Uncle Marlone?\"\n\"Mentor Marlone Kering?\" Deanna and Marceau echoed, their eyes widening in disbelief. The idea of Marlone being their guardian was a shocker. They exchanged glances, clearly caught off guard.\nThey knew Marlone all too well. He had been their combat mentor for a solid month, leaving a lasting impression on them.\nMarlone was notorious for showing favoritism towards Arix while being icy towards everyone else. His double standards had made life tough for their classmates, and now, the thought of him stepping in as their legal guardian stirred up some mixed emotions.\n\"Yeah, it’s our Uncle Marlone,\" Kellan confirmed, grinning at Arix with approval.\n\"But wait,\" Arix said, tilting her head with a puzzled look, \"Isn’t Uncle Marlone still single? Can a single person even be a guardian?\"\nKellan cleared his throat, a bit awkwardly. \"Uh, yes, actually. In the Alliance, there’s a rule that people over 40 who are still single can adopt kids without guardians. The age gap just needs to be more than 40 years between them.\"\n\"Oh, got it,\" Arix nodded thoughtfully, finally putting the pieces together.\nWith Arix’s curiosity satisfied, Kellan turned his attention to Deanna and Marceau. His tone softened, almost as if he didn’t want to spook them, and he asked gently, \"Deanna, Marceau, if you’re okay with it, I can have our Uncle Marlone take care of the adoption process remotely. You just need to confirm it on your opticomputer.\"\nDeanna and Marceau weren’t sure what to say. If they hadn’t known Marlone was involved, it might’ve been an easy decision. But now, knowing who their potential guardian was, they started to hesitate.\nThe idea of being adopted by Marlone was huge for them. It seemed almost too good to be true, like winning a lottery jackpot out of nowhere.\nTheir emotions were all over the place—somewhere between cautious excitement and a whole lot of disbelief.\n’Can we too poor kids, hailing from Planet Void, really be worthy of someone as influential as Marlone Kering stepping up as our guardian?’\nTime ticked by, and they still couldn’t bring themselves to decide.\nWhile Deanna and Marceau wrestled with their thoughts, Arix and Drexel were getting more anxious by the second. Eventually, after a brief exchange of glances, Arix and Drexel made their move. Arix wrapped Marceau in a big hug, while Drexel linked arms with Deanna.\nDeanna and Marceau’s surprised expressions were priceless.\nArix, always the charmer, called Marceau \"Cousin Marceau\" with a sweet smile, then turned to Deanna, adding with a playful wink, \"So, Deanna, will you be my cousin now? And Marceau too—you want to be my cousin, right?\"\nIt was hard for Deanna and Marceau to resist Arix’s affectionate charm. Their doubts melted away as quickly as they had surfaced.\nOnce they agreed, the room filled with excitement. Arix and Kellan were all smiles, and Drexel joined in, calling out \"Cousin Deanna! Cousin Marceau!\" with genuine joy.\nWhen Drexel called out \"Cousin Marceau,\" he dragged out the word with a playful, almost teasing tone. But instead of breaking the ice, his annoying voice had the opposite effect.\nMarceau, who had just started to relax, immediately tensed up, his expression darkening once again.\nEven Deanna instinctively edged away from Drexel, trying to put some space between them.\nDrexel noticed their obvious distaste. Feeling the cold shoulder, he clutched his chest dramatically and pretended to cry. \"Look at that, I just called them cousin, and they shut me out. Fine, fine, I’ll shut up now, boohoo.\"\nArix couldn’t help but think,\n’I must’ve done something really bad in a past life to end up with such a naughty brother in this one.’\nKellan was torn between amusement and exasperation at Drexel’s antics. Shaking his head, he said, \"Alright, alright, cut the drama. No one’s giving you an Oscar. Let’s get serious.\"\nSerious? As far as Drexel was concerned, nothing seemed more serious right now than giving him a good beating. But there was something more urgent at hand.\nKellan continued, \"You’ve all been asleep for a day, so we missed the special training departure. Get up, pack your things, and I’ll take you straight to the training base.\"\nAt Kellan’s words, Arix and the others snapped back to reality, suddenly remembering the special training they were supposed to attend. They couldn’t sit still any longer and quickly jumped out of bed, scrambling to get ready.\n\"We’re all set, Kellan,\" Arix urged, knowing full well that being late on the first day was a one-way ticket to the chief instructor’s bad side. The military had no patience for excuses; late was late, no exceptions.\nUnderstanding their urgency, Kellan didn’t waste another second. He led the four of them onto a military battleship, and they set off towards the mysterious training base, ready—or as ready as they could be—for whatever awaited them.",

      "content": "Chapter 213: The Training Base\nKellan had another task lined up, so after escorting Arix and the others to the cafeteria on the military ship, he left with an adjutant who came to fetch him.\nOnce Kellan was gone, Arix and the group headed to the buffet, picking out whatever caught their eye.\nOn everyone’s plate, only Arix had a balanced mix of vegetables, meat, and fruit. The others, though, were all about the meat, piling their plates high with different kinds of roasted meats.\nEven Deanna, who usually seemed delicate, had a mountain of meat on her plate.\nAs they settled into their seats, everyone couldn’t help but notice how little food Arix had on her plate—barely enough to satisfy a light eater.\n\"Arix, you’re not hungry?\" Deanna asked, sounding a bit worried.\nMarceau also noticed Arix’s sparse plate. It was so little that it wouldn’t have even filled Deanna up when she was a kid. This made Marceau concerned about his new cousin.\n\"Nah, this is just right for me,\" Arix replied with a smile, shaking her head. She had been a fitness fanatic in her past life, so she was used to keeping her diet in check.\nEven though they were in a high-tech era where people didn’t have to worry about overeating, she didn’t see a reason to change her habits.\nDeanna didn’t press further, but she marveled at how little food Arix had. If someone had served her that tiny portion for lunch, she would’ve felt seriously wronged—like someone was punishing her for nothing.\nDrexel, on the other hand, was used to his sister’s small appetite. Still, it didn’t sit well with him to see Arix eating so little. Especially when he noticed that Deanna’s plate had as much meat as his did, he felt that Arix should be eating more too. But he knew change takes time, and getting someone to eat more is a slow process.\nSo, without giving Arix a chance to protest, Drexel picked up a big piece of roasted meat from his plate and plopped it onto hers. His expression was serious, like he was laying down the law, and he said in a firm tone, \"Eat it. If you can’t finish it, I’ll help.\"\nArix glanced down at the huge chunk of meat now sitting on her plate, enough for an entire meal, and then she stared up at Drexel’s determined face. She decided not to argue and quietly nodded in agreement.\nSatisfied that Arix didn’t put up a fight, Drexel gave a content nod and then eagerly dug back into his own food.\nAs they were wrapping up their meal, the conversation shifted to the upcoming special training.\n\"Drexel, since your family’s very well-connected with the army, you must know what to expect at the training base, right? Can you fill us in?\" Deanna asked, her cautious nature prompting her to gather some intel beforehand.\n\"Cousin Deanna,\" Drexel began, not directly answering the question but instead slipping into big-brother mode, \"according to family hierarchy, you should be calling me ’Cousin Drexel.’ Plus, legally and officially, you and Marceau are now the kids of Uncle Marlone, so your family is now very well-connected with the army, too.\"\nIt sounded like a lecture, but Deanna knew Drexel was saying this because he genuinely accepted her and Marceau as part of his family. Even though his words touched her, she still put on a reluctant face and sighed, \"Alright, Cousin Drexel. Now, can you tell us about the training base?\"\nWhen Deanna called Drexel \"cousin,\" his happiness was almost palpable. If he had a tail, it would’ve been wagging like crazy. Still, he knew he had to answer the question seriously.\nClearing his throat, Drexel got down to business. \"The special training base is exactly what it sounds like—a place where the legion selects and trains special forces soldiers. And let me tell you, it’s brutal. I don’t need to sugarcoat it because you can probably imagine how tough it’ll be. So, brace yourselves, both mentally and physically, for the next six months. It might make you feel like you’re better off dead,\" Drexel said, recalling his brief visit to the base.\nHe knew firsthand just how intense the training was. Compared to that, everything they’d been through before would seem like a warm-up.\n\"Is it really that bad? Like, life and death bad?\" Deanna asked, a bit shaken but still skeptical.\nDrexel just shrugged, not bothering to convince her further. He was giving them a heads-up, and whether they believed him was up to them.\nArix quietly linked her arm with Deanna’s. Whether Drexel was exaggerating or not, his words definitely made them take the special training base more seriously. Even after Deanna and Arix returned to their quarters, it was still the main topic of conversation.\n\"Arix, do you really think the special training base is as scary as Drexel says?\" Deanna asked, clinging to Arix’s arm as they walked down the warship’s corridor.\n\"You know how my brother is. His words are trustworthy, but not entirely,\" Arix replied with a reassuring smile.\n\"True,\" Deanna agreed, remembering how Drexel could be a bit unreliable at times. With that thought, her fear started to ease.\nArix, amused, covered her mouth as she laughed. Then, as if a thought had suddenly crossed her mind, she shot Deanna a mischievous grin. \"Deanna, didn’t you say you’d confess your feelings to Marceau after leaving Planet Void? Have you decided when to do it?\"\nThe moment Arix brought it up, Deanna’s face turned bright red, all thoughts of the training base forgotten.\n\"Cough, cough, I’m still underage! It’s too early for that,\" Deanna stammered, trying to cover her embarrassment with a cough.\n\"But didn’t you say you tell Marceau how you feel about him after leaving Planet Void?\" Arix pressed, her eyes wide with feigned innocence.\n\"That was because I thought it would take until I was in my twenties or thirties to be free! Now, if I confess, do you think he would accept it, or would he just run away from me?\" Deanna said nervously, as if imagining the worst possible outcome.\nArix nodded, thinking Deanna had a point. But something about it seemed off.\n’Are people in love really this... rational?’\nArix wondered, glancing suspiciously at Deanna.\n’Is it that Deanna’s feelings for Marceau are more like those of a sibling than a romantic interest?’",

      "content": "Chapter 214: New Training Starts\nArix had a lot on her mind, but they were just vague ideas, so she kept quiet. She knew she wasn’t experienced in these situations and figured it was better to wait and offer her thoughts later, once she had a bit more knowledge under her belt.\nTime flew by on the warship, and before they knew it, dusk was setting in.\nArix and her group finally reached the planet with the special training base.\nThey had to navigate through multiple security checkpoints, but eventually, they made it to the entrance.\nAs she stepped off the warship with her older brother, Arix couldn’t help but look around the base with curious eyes.\nThe place resembled the military base they’d seen before, with its towering walls stretching endlessly into the distance. But after a bit of observation, Arix noticed something that set this base apart—it was way more advanced. For one, there was a massive energy shield hovering in the sky above, something she didn’t recall seeing at the military base.\n\"Kellan, why does the training base have an energy shield? The military base didn’t have one,\" Arix asked, her curiosity piqued.\nDeanna glanced up at the shield, then said, \"I think I heard there are level-three beasts around here. Maybe it’s to keep them from getting out, especially the ones that can fly.\"\nDrexel, with a smug flick of his hair, chimed in, \"Nah, it’s here to protect us. I mean, everyone here is the future of the Alliance.\"\nMarceau just gave them a gentle look, then stared up at the deep blue shield without saying a word.\nKellan, noticing their guesses, smiled slyly and said, \"None of those are right.\"\n\"Then what’s it for? Don’t tell me it’s to keep us in,\" Drexel joked, though he sounded a bit uneasy.\nTo his shock, Kellan nodded. \"Yep, that’s exactly it. The shield’s here to make sure no one escapes.\"\nThe moment Kellan said that, Arix and the others froze, the gravity of his words sinking in. The idea that some might try to flee painted a bleak picture of what lay ahead.\nDrexel gulped nervously and asked, \"Will I still be alive in six months to see you?\"\nWith his usual calm demeanor, Kellan replied, \"Don’t worry. I’m one of the assistant instructors for this training, so I won’t let you die—though you might wish you were half way there.\"\nDrexel suddenly wanted to run, but there was nowhere to go.\nSeeing the drained look on Drexel’s face, Kellan smiled and led the group to the instructor’s office with a satisfied grin.\nAfter they finished registering and picking up their supplies, they said their goodbyes to Kellan and headed off to find their dormitory.\nArix glanced at her dorm room card, then turned to the others with a curious look. \"My dorm is in Building B, 8th floor, room 505. What about you guys?\"\n\"I’m in Building D, 3rd floor, room 402,\" Deanna replied, sounding a bit down. She had been hoping to share a dorm with Arix, and now her earlier excitement seemed to fizzle out.\nDrexel, however, was all smiles. \"Oh, nice! I’m in the same dorm as Marceau!\" He threw an arm around Marceau, waving both their dorm cards like a victory flag.\nMarceau coolly shrugged off Drexel’s arm, but Drexel just put it back, unfazed. Marceau stared at Drexel’s determined arm, sighed, and gave up trying to resist.\nDeanna, too caught up in her own disappointment, didn’t notice her brother’s reaction. Instead, Drexel’s bragging got under her skin. With a huff, she puffed up like an angry little pufferfish, then grabbed Arix’s arm and stomped off.\nDrexel just laughed, clearly enjoying the moment, and tried to sling his arm around Marceau’s shoulder again. This time, Marceau dodged it smoothly.\n\"Seriously, what’s your problem? It’s just an arm. You act like I’m harassing you,\" Drexel pouted, feeling a bit miffed that Marceau wasn’t treating him like a real friend.\nMarceau looked him straight in the eye and said, deadpan, \"I’m ga...\"\nDrexel blinked, not quite catching on. \"What? Pardon?\"\nMarceau fixed him with a long, unblinking stare before finally explaining, \"My sexual orientation. It’s towards men.\"\nThere was a heavy pause as Drexel processed this.\nHis expression morphed from surprise to wide-eyed shock. He pointed at Marceau, then at himself, before dramatically clutching his chest. \"It’s over! It’s over! Uncle Marlone’s family line is doomed!\"\nMarceau rolled his eyes.\n’Is that really the takeaway here?’\nMarceau gritted his teeth, half-expecting Drexel to be a bit slow on the uptake, but even he found Drexel’s thought process hard to follow.\nWith another deep sigh, Marceau decided it was best to ignore him and started heading toward the dorms.\nDrexel, snapping out of his theatrics, quickly jogged after him.\nWorried that Marceau might be feeling a little insecure, Drexel tried to comfort him with a reassuring pat on the shoulder. \"Hey, man, it’s no big deal. Liking guys isn’t a problem. I remember at a place in the universe, they’re all men, and they still marry and have kids just fine.\"\nMarceau shot him a sideways glance. \"They also have different genders: alpha, beta, and omega.\"\nDrexel frowned, still not fully grasping it. \"If they’re all men, what’s the point of splitting them into omega, alpha, and beta?\"\nMarceau clenched his teeth again, deciding he didn’t have the energy to explain this any further, and quickened his pace.\n\"Hey, wait up! Where are you going?\" Drexel called out, hurrying to catch up again.\nArix and Deanna exchanged reluctant goodbyes at the entrance of Building D.\nArix stood there for a moment, watching as Deanna disappeared inside before turning towards her own dorm.\nBuilding D was just a stone’s throw from Building B, separated by only one building. So, it took Arix just a few minutes to reach Room 505 of Building B.\nBefore stepping in, she gave three polite knocks on the door. Then, using the shiny new keycard she’d just received, she unlocked the door and walked inside.\nAs soon as Arix entered, she spotted a young woman, probably around her age, lounging on the couch in the living room, eyes glued to an opticomputer.",

      "content": "Chapter 215: Humiliation\nThe woman glanced up as Arix walked in.\nTheir eyes met briefly. The woman gave Arix a polite nod, but there was no warmth in it.\nArix wasn’t surprised by her new roommate’s chilly vibe. After all, they were kind of like rivals. If they could manage not to get in each other’s way, that would be a win.\nArix returned the nod, then moved past the living room and opened the door to the bedroom that had her name on it.\nThe room was simple and not too big, about 15 square meters. It had the basics: a bed, a desk, and a small wardrobe.\nArix thought about letting Cupid and the others out to play but quickly remembered their constant displays of affection in the psychic world. She rolled her eyes, thinking she’d had enough of their lovey-dovey antics for one day.\nWith a tired sigh, she started unpacking. She put away her daily essentials, toiletries, bed linens, and clothes. Just as she was about to flop onto the bed, she heard a knock on the door.\nSurprised, Arix raised an eyebrow and walked over to open it. Standing there was a girl she hadn’t seen before.\nThis girl wasn’t the one from the living room. Arix guessed she must be one of the other two roommates in Room 505.\nShe had delicate features and was a head taller than Arix. There was something rare and asexuality about her beauty. But what caught Arix off guard was the strange, almost obsessive way the girl was staring at her, like a star-struck fan.\nThough Arix couldn’t deny the girl was attractive, the intensity of her gaze made Arix uncomfortable, like she was being sized up as someone’s possession.\nFeeling a bit uneasy, Arix frowned slightly but still managed to ask politely, \"Is there something you need?\"\nThe girl snapped out of her daze at Arix’s question. Then, with a haughty tilt of her chin, she introduced herself, \"I’m Quinnie. I’m in the room next to yours. I really like you. Let’s be friends.\"\nArix frowned even more at Quinnie’s tone, as if being friends with her was some sort of grand privilege. She couldn’t help wondering if this girl was a bit off.\nAfter a few seconds of internal debate, Arix put on a polite smile and replied, \"Sorry, my mom told me not to get too close with strangers.\"\nQuinnie was unfazed by Arix’s refusal. She just shrugged as if she’d seen it coming. \"You reject people, just like before,\" she remarked with a knowing look. \"But I’m not here to ask for your opinion. From now on, I, Quinnie, am your friend.\"\nWith that, she turned and strolled back to her room, not leaving Arix any room to disagree.\nArix stood there, confused and a bit thrown off.\n’Can you really just decide you’re friends with someone without their say?’\nArix was puzzled but didn’t let it bother her too much. She closed her door and got ready for bed. Tomorrow marked the start of some intense training, and she knew she needed to be well-rested.\nIn the next room, Quinnie answered the persistent ringing of her opticomputer, her expression turning sour at the sight of a blue-haired, red-eyed young man on the screen.\n\"Hardy, you’re a real pain, you know that?\" she said, not hiding her irritation.\nHardy, caught off guard by Quinnie’s appearance in male attire, couldn’t reply right away. Then, as if something clicked in his mind, he perked up.\n\"Quispe, did you change your gender?\" he asked, sounding a bit too eager.\nIf Quispe had become a woman, it meant he could never take the title of crown prince of the Insectoid race.\n\"Hmph, don’t get your hopes up,\" Quispe—now Quinnie—scoffed. \"This is just a temporary disguise.\"\nHardy’s face fell in disappointment. Then, looking confused, he asked, \"Aren’t you supposed to be in the male dorm? Why are you here? You didn’t need to go this far, even for a mission.\"\nAs he spoke, Hardy glanced at Quispe’s female guise with a mix of admiration and embarrassment, pondering how it reflected on the Insectoid royal family.\nQuispe sneered.\n’What do you know? If I hadn’t disguised myself as a girl, how could I have slipped into the girls’ dorm? And if I hadn’t made it here, how would I ever have a shot at becoming Arix’s roommate?’\nBut, of course, Quispe wasn’t about to spill the beans on his real plan.\nClearing his throat, he put on a serious face and said, \"The guys’ dorm is packed with military students and special forces. The girls’ dorm is way quieter, which means it’ll be easier for me to move around and get things done without drawing too much attention.\"\nHardy shot Quispe a skeptical glance, but he had to admit, the reasoning made sense. Their mission was clear: find a way to take out the students getting in the mecha competition, with their first target being Arix. If Quispe stayed in the guys’ dorm, it would make things tricky and could tip off their targets. When he thought about it, the girls’ dorm really was the smarter choice.\n\"Fine,\" Hardy agreed, though he still looked uneasy. \"But you better keep your identity under wraps. If you get caught, the queen’s agent in the Alliance’s high command is toast. And trust me, you do not want to tick off Her Majesty.\"\nQuispe waved him off with a cocky grin. \"When have I ever messed up?\" he said before abruptly cutting the call.\nBack in the insectoid empire, Hardy glared at the blank screen and sighed. \"Let’s hope that’s true.\"\nThe next morning, Arix got dressed and opened her door, only to see that girl—Quinnie—again.\nJust ignore her, just ignore her...\nArix tried to keep calm as she walked past \"Quinnie\" without even glancing her way.\n\"Hey, why are you ignoring me? I’ve been waiting out here for ages!\" Quinnie complained, stepping right into Arix’s path with a pout.\nArix felt like her patience was hanging by a thread.\n’Who even is this girl? And why should I care?’\nBut since they were stuck as roommates, Arix swallowed her irritation and forced a smile. \"Do we know each other from before, Quinnie?\"\n\"We didn’t know each other yesterday, but we definitely do now,\" Quinnie replied, flashing a look that practically said,\n’You can’t get rid of me.’\nShe looked like a pet owner looking at her naughty kitten.\nArix’s eye twitched.\n’Someone help me before I lose it!’\nCompletely oblivious to Arix’s rising annoyance, Quinnie kept babbling on.\n\"Arix, you’re lucky to have me as a friend.\"\n\"People would kill for this chance, but I wouldn’t give it to them.\"\n\"So, you better appreciate it, okay?\"\n...",

      "content": "Chapter 216: Evil Plans\nArix walked out of the dorm with a blank expression, ignoring the pitying looks from their other two roommates.\nIt was only when the hall started filling up with people that Quinnie finally stopped talking.\nFinally free from Quinnie’s nonstop chatter, Arix let out a long breath and eagerly made her way to the training ground. No matter how tough the special training was, it had to be better than dealing with her clingy roommate.\nWhen she arrived, Arix noticed the usual crowd of national mecha team, but today, there were also a bunch of Alliance special forces soldiers going through their own training. They seemed curious about the academy students, though their sympathetic looks were a little hard to ignore.\nThe military students, on the other hand, couldn’t help but admire the tall, imposing special forces. You could see the dreams in their eyes, imagining the day they’d stand as proud and strong as those soldiers.\nArix found herself glancing over at the special forces, too. But her attention was snagged by one soldier who stood out from the rest.\nWhile everyone else seemed interested in the students, this guy couldn’t care less. He was like a lone sunflower turned away from the sun, indifferent to the world around him. The way he carried himself made Arix curious.\n\"Arix, who are you staring at?\" Quinnie’s jealous voice broke through her thoughts. She followed Arix’s gaze and spotted the unusual soldier, the one who wasn’t paying the military students any mind.\nQuinnie instantly jumped to conclusions.\n’Oh, I see what’s going on here,’\nshe thought, narrowing her eyes.\n’He’s probably just trying to play it cool to get Arix’s attention. How pathetic.’\nWith a sneer, Quinnie muttered, \"Bet he’s hiding an ugly face under that helmet. That’s why he’s not showing it.\"\nArix rolled her eyes at Quinnie’s petty comment. She wanted to say something, maybe defend the soldier, but the words just didn’t come. Annoyed, she shifted her focus back to the military students, silently wondering,\n’I hope the coach is someone decent.’\nOn the side of the Alliance special forces, one soldier had caught Arix’s eye, standing tall and completely focused. His face, sharp and refined, gave away nothing.\nNext to him, his buddy nudged him playfully and said, \"Zane, some pretty girl was just checking you out. She’s probably into you. Why not go get her contact number?\"\nZane, who had been ignoring his friend’s teasing, frowned the moment he heard this. With a serious look, he turned to his friend and said, \"They’re still students. Don’t joke around like that.\"\nSeeing the stern expression on Zane’s face, Jaro knew his friend wasn’t playing. He quickly put his hands up in surrender, \"Alright, alright, my bad.\"\nZane gave a slight nod and went back to standing at attention.\nJaro let out a quiet sigh of relief, glad he had avoided another lecture on military conduct. If he hadn’t backed off, Zane would have definitely started on one of his long rants about the rules.\nJaro couldn’t help but think that if it weren’t for Zane’s ridiculously good looks, his strict personality would make sure he never found a girlfriend—or a boyfriend, for that matter.\nBut that was just wishful thinking. With a face like Zane’s, he could probably get anything he wanted.\nZane noticed his friend’s gaze but was used to it, so he brushed it off. What did catch his attention, though, was the sharp, hostile glare he’d been feeling for a while now. At first, he ignored it, but when it didn’t go away, he finally turned to see where it was coming from.\nHe spotted a young woman with delicate, almost asexual features, glaring daggers at him. When she realized he’d noticed her, she raised an eyebrow in disdain and made a throat-slitting gesture.\nZane blinked in surprise.\n’Is this the girl Jaro said was interested in me?’\nShe certainly seemed interested, but more in seeing him dead than anything else.\nRather than get annoyed by her threatening gesture, Zane simply nodded politely in her direction and looked away.\nBut what Zane thought was a courteous nod, Quispe saw as a challenge.\n\"Damn him,\" Quispe seethed internally. \"Not only is he trying to steal Arix’s attention, but now he’s looking down on me too? Hmph, he’s got my attention now!\"\nAs Quinnie mentally planned out how she would tear him to shreds, the coach of the national mecha team finally arrived at the training ground with Kellan.\nWithout any need for instruction, the students quickly lined up in three neat rows based on their height, ten people in each row.\nArix, being on the shorter side, greeted Cirilla before standing next to Deanna, who was about the same height.\nMeanwhile, Quinnie, still fuming, took her place at the front of the girls’ line, her face dark with frustration.\nQuinnie hadn’t expected this—what really set her apart from Arix wasn’t their instructor, their skills, or even their determination. It was something as simple as their height.\nAs Quinnie watched Arix, who was stationed at the back of the line because he was shorter, a wave of frustration and anger surged through her. Silently, she fumed, \"Damn it!\"\nMeanwhile, Arix glanced at Quinnie, standing at the front of the line, and felt an odd sense of relief. A small smile even played on her lips.\nWith Quinnie no longer hovering around her, Arix could focus on observing their coach, feeling much more at ease.\nThe instructor was a man in his forties with a rugged face that only added to his intimidating presence. He stood before the group, silently assessing them for what felt like an eternity. The military students didn’t dare to make a sound, barely breathing as they awaited his words.\nAfter his silent inspection, the instructor finally spoke, his expression stern. \"Hello, students. I’m your instructor, Spears. To my left is my assistant instructor, Kellan Kering.\"\nThe students clapped politely after the introductions, understanding the significance of the moment. But Spears wasn’t one for niceties. He raised a hand, cutting off the applause with a harsh tone. \"First, congratulations to all of you standing here. This means you’re now members of the national mecha team.\"\nPride swelled within the students, their chests puffing out as they took in the weight of his words. Making it this far meant they were the best of the best in the Alliance.\nBut their joy was short-lived. Spears’ sharp voice cut through their pride, \"However! Don’t think that just being here means you can relax. Only ten of you will actually compete. That leaves twenty of you as alternates. And out of those twenty, we’ll only keep three as substitutes. The remaining seventeen? You’ll be sent back to your military academies, out of the special training, and off the national mecha team.\"\nHe spoke with cold precision, like a hunter sizing up his prey.\nThe thought of being sent back, after all the hard work and hope, sent a wave of panic through the students. The idea of returning home in defeat was too much to bear.\nOne student, braving the tension, finally found his voice, \"Sir, we don’t want to go back.\" His words opened the floodgates, and soon others were voicing their agreement, determined not to be sent home.\nFor once, Spears listened, letting them speak. After a moment, he signaled for silence, then addressed them with a challenging tone, \"I see your determination. But I expect your training to show the same resolve. Be warriors in action, not just in words. Now, tell me—can you do it?\"\n\"Yes!\" The students’ voices rang out across the training ground, filled with energy and eagerness.\nTheir shouts even caught the attention of the special forces soldiers nearby, who joined in with enthusiastic applause.\nSpears shot a cold look at the soldiers, quickly silencing them. He turned back to the students, their faces flushed with the intensity of their shouts, and nodded in approval. They had spirit, and that was a good start.\nSatisfied, Spears moved on to announce the day’s training, ready to see if their actions would match their words.",

      "content": "Chapter 217: Special Training\nThe special training was straightforward but intense.\nThe students were each given weighted rings by their coach, designed to add an extra challenge. The task? Run a total of 50 kilometers alongside seasoned soldiers.\nIt might sound brutal, but for these students, who were already in top physical shape, it was more of a test of endurance than anything else.\nSo, with the soldiers in the lead, the students marched confidently into the dimensional training field.\nThey were brimming with self-assurance, though the soldiers—oddly enough—seemed far less enthusiastic.\nThe instructors watched the students’ eagerness with smirks, secretly hoping the grins would stick around. It had been ages since they’d seen such bright, hopeful faces.\nBut Arix wasn’t buying into the optimism. She’d been through the instructors’ tricks before, so she stayed cautious as they began the run.\nAnd sure enough, not long after, things started going sideways. Those who weren’t on guard soon found themselves either tumbling into hidden pits or dangling from trees with one foot caught in a snare.\n\"Where the heck did my friends go? They were right next to me a second ago!\"\n\"Ugh, I hate heights!\"\n\"Is it just me, or does this air feel...\" One unlucky student didn’t even finish their thought before plummeting to the ground.\nSome well-meaning students tried to help their fallen comrades, but the instructors had other ideas. He cranked up the weight of their rings by another 10 kilograms.\nNow, with an extra 40 kilos strapped to their limbs, the 50-kilometer run suddenly felt a lot more daunting.\n\"Sir, I think there’s something wrong with my weight ring,\" one bewildered student complained to the instructor. But instead of fixing the issue, Spears barked back at them, \"There’s nothing wrong with your ring, but there might be something wrong with your brain. Listen up! Cut the pointless sympathy. Your classmates are in training—they don’t need your interference.\"\n\"But sir, it’s not about sympathy. We’re teammates; we’re supposed to look out for each other,\" the student insisted, still not getting the point.\nSpears nearly laughed in frustration. He crossed his arms as he replied coolly, \"You think you’re helping them? You’re not. You’re just making things worse. If they don’t learn how to handle themselves in a crisis now, when will they? On the battlefield? When it’s too late?\"\nThe student’s face went pale as the reality sank in. Sweating more now meant bleeding less later when it really counted. The instructor was right—their good intentions were doing more harm than good.\n\"I’m sorry, Coach. I didn’t realize,\" the student mumbled, lowering their head in shame.\n\"Good. Now, get back to running,\" Spears ordered, his tone a bit softer but still firm. The student nodded, determined to push through the training with a newfound focus.\nOn the military Lev, the special forces instructor chuckled and gave Spears a teasing nudge. \"Another kind-hearted kid lost their innocence, thanks to you.\"\nSpears raised an eyebrow, a smirk playing on his lips. \"With all that soft-heartedness, your hero must be Rexon Tylo, huh?\"\nThe name dropped like a bomb. The special forces instructor’s face went dark. Rexon Tylo was notorious for nearly wiping out an entire mecha squad because he couldn’t keep his sympathy in check.\n\"Uh, I didn’t say anything,\" the instructor quickly backpedaled, realizing it was wiser to stay quiet.\n\"Yeah, typical. All talk, no action,\" Spears scoffed, then shifted his attention back to the trainees. In the mass of people, the military students were lagging far behind the special forces soldiers. Only a handful managed to keep pace.\nEven though the special forces had more experience under their belts, the students from the five elite military academies were supposed to have greater potential.\nSpears frowned. He hadn’t expected them to outshine the soldiers, but the gap was wider than he liked. Maybe he’d been too easy on them.\nHe made a mental note to crank up the intensity for their next round of training.\n\"Huh?\"\nJust as Spears was mulling this over, he noticed a few military students tearing up the field, nearly outpacing the special forces soldiers.\nTwo girls at the front were practically flying, leaving the others in the dust.\n\"Those two must be tight,\" Spears mused, watching Arix and Quinnie push each other to the limit. He was actually a bit impressed.\nArix, blissfully unaware of her instructor’s thoughts, was laser-focused on the race. If she’d known what he was thinking, it would’ve only added to the pressure.\n\"Arix, honey, you can’t shake me off!\" Quinnie called out, dodging yet another trap and flashing a cocky grin at the girl beside her.\n\"Stop calling me that and back off,\" Arix shot back, irritation clear in her voice. She wasn’t bothering to hide her disdain.\nQuinnie just laughed, unfazed. In fact, Arix’s anger only made her more captivating in Quinnie’s eyes.\n\"Oh, Arix, you’re even prettier when you’re mad,\" Quinnie said, her gaze burning with an intensity that was almost predatory.\nZane and Jaro, who were passing by, gave the two of them a curious glance.\nIt’s not that they were nosy; Quinnie’s lines were just too easy to misinterpret.\nJaro, as if something had just occurred to him, quietly leaned over to Zane and whispered, \"Could they be in THAT kind of relationship I’m thinking of?\"\nZane looked at his friend, who seemed to have only one thing on his mind, with a frustrated expression. However, before he could say anything, Quinnie suddenly glared at him with a wary look and said, \"It’s you! Why have you been following us?\"\nZane and Jaro were caught off guard.\n\"Zane? You know her?\" Jaro asked, surprised and curious.\n\"I don’t,\" Zane hesitated, shaking his head.\nAlthough he did remember this young woman who had once threatened him by drawing a line across her throat, they didn’t actually know each other.\nArix didn’t care whether they knew each other or not. Seeing an opportunity, she immediately made her escape.\nShe ran as if she were being chased by an insectoid.\nIt always took a lot to make someone like Arix, who’s obsessed with appearances, not even to admire someone good-looking. It showed just how deep her psychological fear of Quinnie ran.\n\"Arix!\" Quinnie, unhappy to be abandoned, shouted as she chased after her. She gave Zane a fierce glare before running after Arix.\nZane was left slightly stunned by Quinnie’s glare, then he looked blankly at the young woman running away.\n’Does this girl really dislike me that much? But have I ever offended her before? Hmm... do I even know her?’\n\"Zane, that’s not cool. The girl’s giving you flirty looks, and you still say you act like didn’t know her?\" Jaro teased with a raised eyebrow.\nZane rolled his eyes. He didn’t want to criticize the girl, so he just looked at Jaro curiously and asked, \"I really don’t know her, but didn’t you ask me before to get her opticomputer number? Shouldn’t you have known her already?\"\n\"Zane, are you sure we’re talking about the same person?\" Jaro asked, puzzled. Then Jaro continued to explain, \"I was talking about the first girl who left, the little angel, not this fiery one.\"\nWhen Zane realized it wasn’t Quinnie, his eyes flickered, and he finally just said, \"Oh.\"\nMeanwhile, on the other side...\nAfter shaking off Quinnie, Arix couldn’t have been happier.\nBreathing in the air of freedom, even the traps around her seemed charming.\nThese traps weren’t trying to trick her; they were just playing with her, really.\nBut her joy didn’t last long before she heard a voice behind her that made her skin crawl.\n\"Arix, wait for me!\" Quinnie easily dodged the electrified net trap overhead and called out to Arix in a sticky-sweet voice.\nBut instead of stopping, Arix ran even faster, as if she had been injected with adrenaline.\nQuinnie huffed in frustration and then quickened her pace.\nTheir chase caught the attention of others. The special forces soldiers were unfazed, merely thinking that these two military students were quite impressive.\nOn the military students’ side, Cirilla couldn’t help but notice her best friend, Arix, tearing down the field at top speed. Excited, she shouted, \"Hey, girl, are we racing? I’m in!\"\nDrexel, meanwhile, caught sight of Arix running with a younger girl and figured they were just having fun. As Arix zipped past him, he waved and called out, \"Arix, take it easy on her!\"\nArix threw a fierce glare back at her clueless older brother. Grinding her teeth, she decided to save her frustration for later and kept running.",

      "content": "Chapter 218: Romance Starting\nIt was funny how everyone didn’t realize their full potential until they were really pushed.\nIn the grueling 50-kilometer obstacle race, Arix not only managed to outpace most of the students, but she also snagged a spot in the top ten among the special forces.\n\"Impressive! Arix, you did great! There aren’t many special forces soldiers who could keep up with you,\" the special forces instructor praised, clearly impressed.\n\"I’ve been coaching for years, and this is the first time I’ve seen such a hardworking team member,\" Spears added, giving her a thumbs-up.\nEven though she was gasping for breath, Arix felt a warm glow of pride at their praise.\n\"Thank you, sir. I’m just doing my best,\" Arix replied, scratching the back of her head with a shy smile.\nSpears looked at his humble and determined student with growing satisfaction. Then, with a smile that was almost paternal, he said, \"Now that Arix has completed her warm-up, it’s time to start the real training.\"\nArix was just about to relax and wait for everyone to head back to the dorms when her smile froze.\nStunned, she swallowed hard and asked, \"Sir, did I hear you wrong? It’s pretty noisy here just now...\"\nSpears’ smile remained, but it took on a more sinister edge. \"Arix, you heard me just fine. That 50 kilometers was just the warm-up. Now, the real training begins. It’s simple—just survive in there for seven days.\"\nArix’s eyes went wide with shock. Suddenly, it made sense why Quinnie, who had been sprinting even faster than her, vanished right at the finish line.\nThe 50 kilometers that had nearly sucked the life out of her was just a warm-up!\n\"Arix, are you ready? You going in on your own, or do I need to give you a hand?\" Spears asked, pointing to the dimensional training ground beside him.\nArix instinctively took a step back, disbelief written all over her face. \"Sir, you’re joking, right?\"\n\"Not at all. Off you go!\" Spears let out a dark chuckle, like a villain in a bad movie. Then he promptly kicked Arix into the second dimensional training ground.\n\"Oh my gosh! Coach, you’re a total devil!\" Arix screamed as she disappeared into the entrance of the training ground.\nSpears just chuckled darkly, waiting for the next student to arrive.\nAs each one staggered across the finish line, Spears repeated the process, sending them straight into the second training ground without a second thought.\nThe students’ desperate cries echoed through the air, so full of despair that anyone nearby might’ve felt a pang of sympathy.\nBut the special forces soldiers had seen this coming. They accepted their fate and walked into the second training ground without complaint.\nAfter all, anyone who came to the Legion’s special training thinking they were only in for a 50-kilometer run was just dreaming. And that dream was bound to end the moment they crossed the finish line.\n...\nThe moment Arix hit the ground in the Dimensional Training Field, her eyes locked with a swarm of wild beasts.\nThe air was thick with tension, and fear rooted her to the spot.\nFor a heartbeat, everything was still.\nThen the silence shattered as the beasts roared in unison, their jaws snapping as they charged toward her.\n\"Roar! Roar! Roar!\"\n\"God, darn it!\"\nThe wild howls of the beasts echoed around her, blending with Arix’s panicked scream. But her instincts, honed by countless battles and rigorous training, kicked in just in time.\nArix dodged the first attack by a hair’s breadth. Desperate, she reached for a weapon from her Space Button, only to find—nothing. Her fingers grasped at thin air.\nThree seconds of pure dread passed before it dawned on her: this dimensional space had blocked her Space Button.\nMuttering every curse she could think of about her instructors, Arix dragged her exhausted body forward. She forced her psychic power to manifest a sword, and with a desperate swing, she began hacking away at the beasts.\nArix had assumed she could outsmart or outrun them, but reality had other plans.\nThese beasts seemed unnervingly good at tracking her. Every attempt to hide was a failure, and the longer it went on, the clearer it became—this had Spears’ devilish fingerprints all over it.\nBut what could she do? March up and give him a piece of her mind? Hardly. Instead, Arix bit down on her frustration, cursing Spears in her mind as she engaged in a deadly game of cat and mouse with the relentless beasts.\nAs evening finally rolled in, something strange happened. The beasts, as if following some invisible command, took a few steps back and then turned tail, sprinting away.\nArix stood there, panting heavily, her sword trembling in her hands. She had danced with death too many times that afternoon, and it left her completely drained—both body and mind.\nShe didn’t even bother tending to her many wounds before she collapsed onto the grass, out cold.\nWhen she came to, it was deep into the night. Her body ached, and her stomach growled angrily.\nWith no other option, she staggered over to the pile of beasts she had taken down earlier, grabbed one, and headed for a nearby river.\nThere, she tended to her wounds as best she could, skinned the beast, and cleaned it up. Soon, a fire was crackling, and she began roasting the meat while her mind raced.\nShe’d been fighting off these beasts all afternoon and hadn’t seen a single classmate. She guessed they were either in separate training fields or just too far away to run into.\nBut given how vast this training field likely was, she figured the second option was more probable.\nWith that thought, Arix stopped worrying. She was confident in her strength, and even if she had to go solo for these seven days, she was sure she could survive just fine.\nWhile Arix was navigating her solo struggle, Quinnie had a different experience altogether. Shortly after stepping into the Dimensional Training Field, she bumped into Zane.\n\"I’ve told you, stop following me,\" Quinnie snapped, clearly irritated as Zane trailed behind her.\nThe beast horde had just subsided, and after an entire afternoon of battling, even Quinnie, as strong as she was, looked a bit worn out. But what really grated on her nerves was the persistent human who wouldn’t leave her side.\n\"We should team up,\" Zane suggested calmly. \"You saw what happened with the beast horde earlier. It’s safer if we stick together.\"\nQuinnie didn’t bother hiding her disdain. \"Who would want to team up with you? You’re too weak to even be a decent opponent, let alone a teammate.\"\nShe lifted her chin, looking at Zane as if he were beneath her.\nShe was the noble crown prince of the insectoid race—no way was she going to lower herself to team up with a mere human.\nBut just ten minutes later, she found herself leaning against a tree, eyeing the roasting meat over the fire with reluctant interest.\nAs much as she hated to admit it, Zane, despite being a weak human, could cook surprisingly well.\nZane noticed her struggling to maintain her aloof act and, with a knowing smile, offered, \"Want some?\"\nHer stomach growled in response, but she stubbornly lifted her head. \"Hmph, I, Quinnie, would rather starve or be eaten by beasts than eat your food.\"\n\"Are you sure?\" Zane’s smile grew a little wider.\nAfter a moment of tense silence, hunger finally overpowered her pride. She quietly sat down by the fire, snatched up the skewers, and started devouring the meat.\nZane chuckled softly, watching her eat. \"Take it easy; there’s plenty.\"\nOnce her hunger was satisfied, Quinnie sprawled out on the grass, her mood somewhat better. She glanced over at Zane, who was still busy roasting meat for her.\nShe pouted a bit and then, as if doing him a massive favor, said, \"Hey, since your cooking isn’t terrible, I suppose I’ll let you team up with me.\"\nZane paused, a slight smile playing on his lips. \"Alright.\"\nQuinnie huffed but didn’t fire back with her usual sharp tongue. Instead, she closed her eyes, letting exhaustion take over.\nAs sleep began to claim her, thoughts of finishing the mission quickly drifted through her mind. The Alliance’s training base was hardly a place where an insectoid should linger.\nAfter finishing his meal, Zane prepared to get some rest too. But before settling in, he noticed Quinnie’s delicate face, now peaceful in sleep. With a small, quiet gesture, he took off his jacket and gently draped it over her.\nHe found his own spot beneath a tree and leaned against it, ready to sleep.\nIn her sleep, Quinnie’s eyelashes fluttered slightly. She instinctively pulled the jacket tighter around herself, a small, secretive smile playing on her lips.",

      "content": "Chapter 219: Poor Quinnie\nMaybe there’s something about getting fed that just makes it hard to stay mad at someone.\nEver since that meal, Quinnie hadn’t grumbled about Zane anymore. In fact, she’d even stepped in to save him a few times when things got rough.\nZane was strong, with the skills of a trained soldier, but he always tried to shield Quinnie, which ended up making him a prime target for wild animals.\n\"Zane, be careful! What if you mess up your hands and can’t make me food anymore?\" Quinnie shouted, blocking yet another wild creature with an irritated edge to her voice.\n\"My bad. I’ll be more careful next time,\" Zane replied calmly.\nOver the past few days, he’d gotten a good read on Quinnie’s temper. Whether he was in the right or not, it was easier to just agree with her and keep things smooth.\nHearing Zane’s promise, Quinnie puffed up with satisfaction, dropping her anger just as quickly as it had flared up.\nIt seemed Zane was the only one who could manage her fiery personality. If it had been Arix instead, she’d probably have told her to get the hell out of her sight.\nAs the sky dimmed into dusk, the wild animals that had been attacking them suddenly pulled back, like they were following some unseen command. They took a few steps away, then bolted off into the distance.\nOnce they were sure the coast was clear, Quinnie and Zane let out matching sighs of relief. The day’s battle was over, and it was time for their usual meal.\nThis time, Zane didn’t just stick to roast things. He had picked some fresh fruit for Quinnie and brewed a cup of tea using leaves from a nearby tree.\nWhen he served it up, he filtered out any stray leaves and even peeled the fruit for her.\nQuinnie, like royalty, casually accepted Zane’s care. He didn’t mind one bit and even saved the best bites for her.\n\"Not bad, but the meat’s a little bland,\" Quinnie commented, trying to sound tough while enjoying every bite.\nZane smiled, warm and patient, and promised to add more salt next time.\nAfter they were full and content, Quinnie was ready to call it a night.\nTheir sleeping arrangements had come a long way from a few days ago when they were sleeping under the stars.\nZane had found a cave for them to stay in. If it had just been him, any tree would’ve done, but he wanted something better for Quinnie.\nThe cave was dry, probably a spot some animal had prepped for her young, but now it belonged to the two of them.\nAs always, Zane handed over his jacket for Quinnie to use as a blanket before finding a corner to sit in and catch some sleep.\nBut just as he was drifting off, Zane’s eyes snapped open, focusing on a shadowy figure in front of him.\nHe looked up, his gaze sharp, and saw something unexpected.\nQuinnie stood there, breathing heavily, her face flushed. But her expression was anything but friendly.\n\"What did you put in that tea earlier?\" Quinnie asked, glaring at Zane with clenched teeth. Her voice was hoarse, barely masking her frustration.\nZane, caught off guard by her strange demeanor, hesitated before answering, \"Passion Sprout tea. It’s supposed to refresh you and ease fatigue.\"\nQuinnie stared at Zane for a long moment, her expression hard to read. Then she clenched her jaw and started to stumble toward the cave’s entrance.\n\"Quinnie, what’s wrong?\" Zane called after her, his concern quickly overshadowing his confusion as he hurried to follow.\n\"Stay away from me!\" Quinnie shot back, her voice sharp with anger.\n\"You can barely stand! I can’t just leave you like this. What’s going on? Tell me, and I’ll help you,\" Zane pleaded. He was still in the dark but increasingly worried that somehow, he had caused this.\n\"Help me? You really think I need YOUR help?\" Quinnie spat, glaring at him. She wanted to hurl a curse his way but held it in. How could she possibly explain to this human that Passion Sprout worked like a potent aphrodisiac for her kind?\nIf Zane were a woman, Quinnie, or actually Quispe, might have just gone with the flow. But Zane was a man, and as a proud insectoid crown prince, Quispe couldn’t allow himself to give in to these urges with him.\n\"Quinnie, please, just tell me what’s happening!\" Zane’s voice was full of worry as he noticed the sweat forming on her forehead. His face was etched with concern.\nHe was so wrapped up in worrying about her that he didn’t notice the changes happening to himself. But Quinnie, expecting this, quickly caught on as she saw Zane’s face start to flush.\nWhen a male insectoid enters heat, they release a gas similar to pheromones that acts like an aphrodisiac. The signs were becoming clear: Zane’s grip on her hand was growing stronger, and his gaze was beginning to lose focus.\n’Damn it.’\nRealizing how bad things were getting, Quinnie shoved Zane away and tried to stagger toward the cave’s entrance. If she didn’t get away now, things would spiral out of control.\nThere was no way she was going to end up in a compromising position—either by taking advantage of a man or letting herself be taken advantage of!\nThough the Passion Sprout had triggered her heat, she knew that soaking in lake water could help her ride it out. Fortunately, there was a lake nearby. If she could just reach it, she could salvage her dignity!\nBut she had underestimated both the Passion Sprout’s effect and Zane’s strength. The man who was usually so gentle and considerate suddenly became forceful, grabbing her from behind and pulling her into a firm embrace.\nBeing held so intimately by a man was a massive insult to Quinnie. She was just about to spin around and hurl some choice words at him when Zane’s hand gripped the back of her head, and he leaned in to kiss her.\nQuinnie’s eyes widened in shock. For a moment, she didn’t know whether to focus on her painfully twisted neck or stopping Zane’s tongue from invading her mouth.",

      "content": "Chapter 220: Guilty Zane\nQuispe found himself in a daze; Zane suddenly pinned him against the wall before he could even process what was happening.\nZane’s hand, warm and strong, began to glide upwards from Quispe’s lower abdomen.\nAs Zane’s arm pushed Quispe’s clothing aside, it revealed his slim, toned waist, and the cool air hitting his exposed skin snapped Quispe back to reality.\nAs his senses returned, Quispe realized the tall man was acting recklessly. The shock hit him like a wave, making him shiver.\nFurious when the situation fully registered, Quispe bit down hard, his anger boiling over.\nThe sharp pain made Zane, who was still caught up in the moment, grunt and release his grip on Quispe’s lips.\nThe second Quispe’s mouth was free, he didn’t hesitate—he kicked Zane off him with all his might.\nBAM!\nZane hit the wall with a thud and slumped to the ground. The jolt of pain started to clear his head.\nNow more aware, Zane looked up in a daze. Seeing Quispe’s disheveled clothes and the marks on his neck, it all clicked.\nThe realization of what he’d done hit Zane like a ton of bricks. The swollen lips, the messy clothes—everything screamed guilt at him.\n\"I...\" Zane stammered, his eyes wide with shock and guilt, struggling to find words to apologize to \"Quinnie.\"\n’I forced myself on Quinnie! I’m a monster!’\nZane’s hand flew up as he slapped himself, the sting of shame burning through him. If a gun had been within reach, Zane might’ve seriously considered ending it all right then.\nQuispe, still seething, paused in surprise at Zane’s self-punishment. But then it hit him that Zane’s remorse didn’t change a thing for him.\nWith a fierce glare, Quispe spat the blood from his mouth, let out a cold, dismissive snort, and he began to leave the cave. His steps were shaky, and Zane’s heart raced with worry. The fear that Quispe might collapse any second gripped him.\nWithout caring if the \"young woman\" would resent him, Zane rushed forward and scooped Quispe up into his arms, cradling him like a princess.\nWhat might have been a romantic gesture to someone else was nothing but an insult to Quispe’s pride. He shook with anger.\n\"Zane! Put me down! I can walk!\" Quispe yelled, his voice laced with fury.\n\"Where do you want to go? I’ll take you,\" Zane responded firmly, ignoring Quispe’s angry struggles.\nSensing Quispe’s fear, Zane quickly added, \"I’m fully awake now. I won’t do that to you again, I swear.\"\n\"You... I...\" Quispe almost blurted out the truth, that he was actually a man and didn’t need to be afraid, but he bit his tongue, thinking better of it. Frustration welled up, and he just clamped his mouth shut.\n\"The lake. Take me to the lake,\" Quispe finally muttered, giving up as exhaustion took over. He closed his eyes, done with trying to deal with this troublesome situation.\n\"Alright,\" Zane replied with a slight smile. Holding Quispe gently, he quickly made his way toward the lake.\nA little while later, Zane gently set Quispe down in the lake. He even picked a spot where a large stone jutted out of the water, so Quispe could lean against it comfortably.\nThe cool water instantly soothed the heat simmering inside Quispe, and he let out a contented sigh, appreciating Zane’s thoughtfulness.\nLost in the refreshing embrace of the water, Quispe closed his eyes and relaxed. He didn’t notice the deep red flush creeping up Zane’s face on the shore, making it look like he might start bleeding from sheer embarrassment.\nFlustered, Zane quickly turned his back to Quispe, desperately trying to get a grip. But his mind kept circling back to the cave—the young woman’s flushed cheeks, those dazed eyes, their lips meeting, and the chemistry between them...\nSLAP!\n’She’s so young, Zane! How could you even think of hurting her like that? Gosh, what kind of monster am I?\"\nZane slapped himself again, this time even harder, driven by a crushing guilt.\nThe sound of the slap echoed through the night, startling Quispe out of his peaceful moment in the lake.\nQuispe shot a glance at Zane, feeling slightly baffled.\n’What’s wrong with this guy?’\nhe thought,\n’Is he seriously messed up? Slapping himself like that?’\nHe couldn’t help thinking,\n’Humans really are more twisted than us insectoids!’\nAfter silently venting his annoyance, Quispe decided Zane wasn’t worth his attention and stretched out lazily on the stone, turning his gaze to the stars above.\n’What Arix is up to right now? She’s probably thinking about me.’\nA mischievous smile curled Quispe’s lips as he happily splashed his feet in the lake, completely content in the moment.\n...\nAfter finishing her dinner in a rush, Arix found a random spot to crash and was out like a light in no time.\nThe past few days had really taken a toll on her. Just when one of her old wounds started to heal, she’d end up with a fresh one the next day.\nTo top it off, her Space Button—loaded with level-three healing potions—was useless in the training ground, leaving her without any way to speed up her recovery.\nAt first, Arix tried hunting for some medicinal ingredients to patch herself up, but after combing through the training ground for what felt like forever, she came up empty-handed.\nLeft with no better option, she had to settle for basic first aid and bandaged her wounds the best she could.\nThanks to her Supergiant-Class physical strength, minor cuts and even some deeper gashes healed with just a little help. But the really nasty injuries—like the deep cuts down to the bone and the puncture wound in her shoulder—were a different story.\nDespite her best efforts to clean and bandage them, the lack of proper supplies and all the intense training during the day made these wounds not only stubborn but also infected.\nAs she slept, her body was restless, the pain seeping into her dreams.\nEvery so often, a muffled groan would escape her lips.\nOnce they were sure Arix was out cold, Cupid and the others quietly slipped out from their psychic world.\nThey lined up, sitting in silence as they watched Arix, their faces filled with concern at the sight of her scarred body.\n\"Arix has so many wounds. She must be hurting so much,\" Cupid whispered, snuggling closer to Sylvana, his big, round eyes welling up with tears.\nVita, Sophia and Sylvana felt the same heavy sadness. They had tried countless times to help Arix over the past few days, but she always turned them down.\nThis special training was a rite of passage for every military student and special forces soldier. If Arix leaned on them to get through it, it would feel like cheating.\nEven though Arix was firm in her refusal, Vita and the others couldn’t help sneaking out to assist her while she slept.\n\"Vita, be careful, or Arix will notice,\" warned Sophia, now transformed into a blue-haired beauty, her expression tense and serious.\nAlthough Arix’s Space Button was disabled, Vita and the others still had access to theirs. They pulled out some healing potions from their own Space Buttons, planning to secretly help Arix out.\n\"Yeah, I got it,\" Vita replied with a serious nod, as if he was about to carry out a crucial mission.\nSophia relaxed a bit at his response. Vita was the most compassionate of them all, making him the best choice for this delicate task. If it were left to her, Sophia, or even Sylvana, things might not go so smoothly.",

      "content": "Chapter 221: A Dream\nJust as they were about to make their move, Arix, who seemed to be in a deep sleep, suddenly sighed and softly caught Vita’s wrist, stopping him from giving her the potion.\n\"Arix... you’re awake,\" Vita stammered, clearly taken aback as he looked into her open eyes.\nArix nodded slowly, then let her gaze drift to Cupid and the others.\nThey quickly looked away, guilt written all over their faces.\nCupid was so startled that she darted behind Sylvana, trying to hide.\nJust when everyone braced themselves for Arix to get upset, they were all taken aback by her reaction.\n\"Thank you,\" Arix said softly, her voice filled with gratitude instead of anger. She looked at them with warmth in her eyes. She knew they were only worried about her, so how could she possibly be mad at them?\n\"Arix... you’re not mad at us?\" Cupid asked cautiously, peeking out from behind Sylvana, her face filled with worry.\nArix shook her head, feeling a tug at her heart when she saw Cupid’s worried expression. \"No, I’m not mad at all. I know you’re all just trying to help me, so there’s no reason to be upset.\"\nRelieved, Cupid let out a breath she didn’t realize she was holding. \"That’s a relief! I’m so glad you’re not mad, Arix.\"\nWith Arix’s reassurance, Cupid felt a surge of confidence. She took the potion from Vita and held it out to Arix. \"Then you should drink this. Your wounds are really bad.\"\nArix wanted to take it—her wounds had left her utterly drained. But she knew she had to stick to her principles. With a sigh, she gently pushed the potion back. \"Cupid, you need to put that away. I can’t drink it.\"\n\"Why not? I can tell you’re in a lot of pain. Why won’t you take the potion?\" Cupid asked, her eyes wide with confusion. She even started to wonder if the infection had messed with Arix’s head.\nSeeing Cupid’s concerned look, Arix couldn’t help but smile a little, though she felt a bit exasperated. Still, she explained patiently, \"Cupid, it’s not just me who can’t drink healing potions. Right now, no one in the training ground can. If I secretly take it, it would be cheating, and that wouldn’t sit well with anyone.\"\nCupid tried to wrap her head around it but still seemed a bit puzzled. She turned to Sophia, hoping he could explain it better.\nSophia stayed quiet for a moment before letting out a resigned sigh. \"We get it, Arix. Just promise us, if it gets too tough, you’ll call us out, okay?\"\n\"Mm-hmm,\" Arix nodded, her expression sincere.\nSophia gave Arix a gentle pat on the head before vanishing. Vita and Sylvana lingered a moment longer, offering a few more words of concern, before reluctantly returning to the psychic world one by one.\nOnce they were gone, Arix glanced up at the sky, which was beginning to lighten with the approaching dawn.\nWithout a word of complaint, she got to her feet. A sword appeared in her hand as she steeled herself for another day of facing the wild beasts.\n...\nAnother grueling day of battling the beast horde had ended. Arix did a quick mental tally, figuring that if she could survive just one more day, freedom was within reach.\nLike clockwork, she made her way to the river, washing the blood and dirt from her wounds. Then, she selected a bear-like creature from the pile of fallen beasts, chopped off a pair of its hefty paws, and set about cleaning and roasting them over a crackling fire.\nDinner was satisfying, and as Arix finished off the last bite, a heavy yawn escaped her.\nThe day had left her more exhausted than usual, though she couldn’t quite pin down why. Shrugging it off, she let her eyes drift shut, surrendering to sleep.\nThat night, something was different—she dreamed. Arix wasn’t sure how she knew it was a dream, but the sheer impossibility of the scene clued her in.\nIn this dream, she found herself in what looked like a prime tourist spot, the kind that would be all over social media.\nEverything around her seemed overly picturesque, almost as if someone had applied a filter to make the world more vibrant.\nWhile the scenery was stunning, the creatures she encountered were straight out of ancient legends. Strange beings roamed the landscape: a small, headless creature with two pairs of wings, a majestic nine-tailed fox, a fiery little bird, and a bizarre bird with a human face.\nAt first, Arix just watched, intrigued by the odd assortment of creatures. Then it clicked—these weren’t random animals. They were mythological beings, the fiery bird was a young Phoenix. She was sure she had seen other creatures somewhere else, but she just couldn’t pinpoint when and where.\nArix scratched her head, amazed at how vivid and detailed her imagination was to conjure up such a dream.\n\"Arix.\" A familiar voice cut through the dream, making her spin around in surprise. There stood Scion, clad in the robes of a pontifex.\n\"Scion?\" Arix hadn’t expected to see him in her dream, and a wave of excitement surged through her as she called out his name.\nWith a gentle nod, Scion smiled and opened his arms, as if waiting for her to come closer.\nWithout hesitation, Arix felt her body move toward him, as if on autopilot. It was a dream, after all, so it seemed normal to be swept along.\nBut just as she was about to embrace him, a sharp pain shot through her chest.\nLooking down, she saw with horror that Scion’s arm had pierced straight through her heart.\n\"Who... are you?\" Blood trickled from her lips as she gazed up at the man who wore Scion’s face but felt utterly different.\nThis wasn’t Scion. The real Scion always had a cold, distant look, but this man’s eyes were something else—void of any humanity, like a god detached from the world.\nThe dream-Scion didn’t respond. Instead, he gently brushed a strand of hair from her face and whispered, \"Sylvana, it’s time for you to come home.\"\nArix had no idea what he meant. The world spun around her, and then everything went black.\nAs the Arix in the dream took her final breath, the real Arix’s breathing grew shallow, teetering on the brink of death.\nThe military students were deep into their Lev training when a sudden, ear-splitting alarm shattered the focus of both the instructor and the instructor. Their opticomputers flashed urgently, with Arix’s name blazing in blood red across the screens.\n\"What the hell? How could Arix be in danger? She’s one of the best!\" Spears shouted, his voice edged with shock as he stared in disbelief at the screen.\n\"Maybe it’s just a glitch. It’s nighttime—the beasts shouldn’t even be out,\" the instructor suggested, though the tension in his voice betrayed his own unease.\n\"Glitch or not, we can’t take any chances. If something’s really happened to Arix, we’re in way over our heads,\" Spears said, his face hardening with resolve.\n\"Understood,\" the instructor replied, not wasting another second. They whipped their Levs around, racing toward Arix’s last known location.",

      "content": "Chapter 222: Truth Of Her Transmigration\nMeanwhile, just as Arix was teetering on the brink of death, the Moon’s Blessing—the sapphire necklace she always wore—erupted in a brilliant light. A surge of power exploded from the gem, enveloping her in its protective embrace.\nThis sapphire energy wasn’t just a shield; it waged a fierce battle against another force—a sinister white energy trying to snuff out Arix’s life.\nAs the struggle continued, both forces began to weaken, but the sapphire’s power ultimately won out, swallowing the white energy whole.\nHowever, this victory came at a cost. The Moon’s Blessing, once vibrant and full of life, dimmed, its brilliant blue fading until it was nothing more than a dull, transparent stone.\nWith the gem’s transformation, Arix’s ragged breathing slowly steadied, returning to a normal rhythm.\nFar away in the Empire, at the exact moment the sapphire lost its glow, Cassian, who had been resting peacefully, suddenly snapped awake.\nA golden pattern flickered to life on his forehead, and in an instant, the youthful features of the young Cassian were replaced by those of a mature, formidable man.\nCassian’s eyes, now a piercing gold, held a depth of power and authority. His short hair cascaded into long, white locks, and his once boyish face now carried the cold, awe-inspiring presence of someone touched by the divine.\nBarefoot, he stepped onto the small balcony outside his room. His golden eyes glowed faintly as he gazed into the night, his voice low but laced with a deadly warning, \"Do not touch her. This is your final warning.\"\nWith that, Cassian’s form reverted back to that of a 15-year-old. Like a marionette, he returned to his bed, falling back into a deep sleep as if nothing had happened.\nIn a distant realm, a god with a cold, solitary look slowly wiped blood from the corner of his mouth. A bitter smile twisted his lips as he sneered, \"So, the divine child is angry—how amusing.\"\nMeanwhile, in the Empire, deep within the Moon Goddess Temple...\nVezgor was in the midst of a solemn prayer when, out of nowhere, he coughed up blood.\nHis once vibrant complexion faded in an instant, the weight of years seemingly crashing down on him. But his thoughts weren’t on himself; they were far away, in the direction of the Alliance.\n\"Arix,\" he murmured, the worry evident in his voice.\nAfter a moment, Vezgor, now appearing much older, wiped the blood from his lips.\nWithout delay, he left the temple and headed to his usual retreat. Inside his private quarters, he retrieved an opticomputer from a drawer and made a call to someone he had always carried a deep burden of guilt for.\nFleur’s face soon appeared on the screen. She looked anxious, almost as if she had been expecting the call. \"Did something happen to Arix again?\" she asked, her voice trembling.\nHer use of the word \"again\" wasn’t without reason.\nMore than one decade ago, something eerily similar had happened. Her once lively and full-of-life daughter had suddenly collapsed without warning.\nArix’s breathing had grown fainter by the minute, and no amount of intervention seemed to help. Doctors, healers—nothing worked. Until, out of the blue, this man, whom Fleur had never seen before, appeared at her daughter’s side.\nIt was the robes he wore that gave him away. The moment Fleur saw the garb of a pontifex, she realized this man was her estranged father. Yet, even as he looked down at his dying granddaughter, his face remained cold, detached, as if what he saw didn’t touch him at all.\nFleur would never forget how he barely glanced at Arix before turning to her with an icy stare. \"She wasn’t meant to exist in this world,\" Vezgor had said, his voice void of emotion.\nThe shock of his words ignited a fire in Fleur. She had already been on edge, but now she was furious. \"Arix is my daughter. I love her and raised her with my life. Who are you to say she shouldn’t exist?\" she had snapped back, her voice filled with rage.\nBut Vezgor didn’t argue. He only laid out two options. One was to let nature take its course, allowing Arix to die. The other was to send her soul temporarily to another world, promising it would return in time.\nFleur had felt cornered. The choice was impossible, but as she watched her daughter’s life slipping away, she made the painful decision to accept the second option.\nThe next day, Arix’s body had recovered, though those who knew her noticed a stark change in her personality. They assumed it was a result of her close brush with death, but Fleur knew the truth—her daughter’s soul had been replaced.\nSo when \"Arix\" vanished later on, Fleur had managed to keep her emotions in check, continuing her life as if nothing had happened.\nBack in the present, Fleur snapped out of her memories and focused on her father’s face on the screen. She couldn’t hold back any longer. \"You promised Arix would be safe after you sent her away ten years ago. What’s changed? Why is she in danger now?\"\nVezgor met his daughter’s gaze with a calmness that only deepened her frustration. \"The force that wants Arix dead is too strong,\" he said evenly. \"I can no longer protect her. We must find someone else who can.\"\n\"Who?\" Fleur asked, her voice steady despite the storm of doubt brewing inside her.\nFor all his flaws, Vezgor was undeniably the most powerful being in this world. If even he couldn’t keep Arix safe, Fleur couldn’t imagine who could.\n\"Cassian, the crown prince of the Empire,\" Vezgor replied with absolute seriousness. There was no hint of humor in his tone. \"If Arix becomes engaged to him, their destinies will intertwine, and that will be enough to shield her.\"\nFleur’s immediate reaction was disbelief. She couldn’t believe what she was hearing. Arix was so young! The idea of her daughter being engaged at such a young age seemed beyond reason.\n\"This is the only way to protect her,\" Vezgor said, his voice weighted with the gravity of the situation. \"Otherwise, Arix will die this year.\"\nOn the other end of the call, Fleur fell silent. The weight of his words pressed down on her, leaving her at a loss.\nAfter a long, tense pause, she finally spoke, her voice rough with emotion. \"Is there no other way?\"\nVezgor closed his eyes and shook his head slowly. The entity hunting Arix was no mere mortal—it was a true deity. And besides Cassian, who carried the soul of a god within him, Vezgor could think of no one else capable of shielding his granddaughter from such divine wrath.\n\"I understand. Thank you, Father,\" Fleur whispered, her voice resigned, before ending the call.\nThe word \"Father\" struck Vezgor. It was the first time Fleur had ever called him that, and for a moment, he was stunned.\nA flicker of joy lit up his face, but it was quickly overshadowed by another violent coughing fit. Blood spattered his hands as he struggled to catch his breath.\nHe stared down at the blood, a grim reminder of his own mortality. \"There’s not much time left,\" he muttered, his voice barely above a whisper.\nAfter a moment of contemplation, Vezgor wiped the blood away, pushing aside his thoughts of weakness. He raised his eyes to the night sky, where the stars twinkled like distant memories.\nA soft, almost wistful smile touched his lips as he murmured, \"Just a little longer, my love. I’ll be there with you soon.\"\nIn the depths of his weary eyes, he could almost see a vision of two young tiger cubs, frolicking under the same night sky—just as they had done in the days of their youth.",

      "content": "Chapter 223: Extinguished\nWhen Arix woke up again, she was hit with some news that didn’t sit right with her.\n\"Arix, I’m sorry, but you’ve been disqualified from the upcoming freshman mecha competition. Your health condition just isn’t fit to participate,\" Spears said, his tone a mix of firm and regretful as he stood by her hospital bed.\n\"Coach, you were praising me just a while ago. What changed? Why am I suddenly out?\" Arix asked, trying to shake off the uneasy feeling from the weird dream she’d just had.\nArix wasn’t one to brag, but she knew her skills were solid—top five out of 30 students wasn’t a stretch. If this had happened earlier, maybe she could’ve seen it coming, but now? It didn’t add up.\n\"Arix, do you really not remember anything?\" Spears asked, giving her a sharp look.\n\"Remember what? I just took a nap and had a bad dream, that’s all,\" Arix replied, clearly puzzled.\nSpears stared at her for a beat, then cautiously asked, \"You almost died. Don’t you remember?\"\n\"Coach, seriously? Stop messing with me. How could I have died?\" Arix said, thinking he was playing some cruel joke.\nInstead of answering, Spears pulled out a recorder and played a video on a holographic screen.\nThe footage showed a young woman who looked exactly like Arix, lying on the ground, barely clinging to life.\nArix’s eyes widened in shock as she pointed at the screen. \"That’s not me! Her necklace isn’t the same color as mine!\"\nInstinctively, she reached for her own necklace, but the moment she saw it, her words caught in her throat.\nThe blue gemstone that usually hung around her neck had turned into a dull, clear stone.\n\"What... how did this happen?\" Arix whispered, staring in disbelief at her necklace.\nIt was hers, no doubt about it, but how could it have changed like that?\nSuddenly, the memory of the searing pain from her dream flashed back. She looked at the now-colorless necklace again, and a terrifying thought began to take root.\n’Is the dream real? Has the Moon’s Blessing tried to protect me, and this is the result?’\nWhile Arix wrestled with these thoughts, Spears sighed and said, \"This wasn’t just my decision. Your parents had a say in it too. I think it’s best if you rest now. Someone’s coming this afternoon to take you from the training base.\"\nThe mention of her parents, Thaddeus and Fleur, made Arix’s resistance crumble. If they were involved, then this was beyond her instructor’s control. She decided not to push back against Spears and figured she’d wait to talk to her parents, hoping to find some middle ground.\n\"I get it. Thank you, sir,\" Arix finally said, giving in.\nSpears sighed, his regret evident. If things had gone differently, Arix would’ve been a top contender in the mecha competition—only there was no \"if\" now. Shaking his head, he left the room, leaving Arix to her thoughts.\nAfter Spears left, Arix stared down at the necklace, her face clouded with worry.\n\"Scion...\" she whispered, the word slipping out like a secret.\nShe held onto the necklace for a few more seconds, then let it go and shut her eyes, feeling the weight of exhaustion pull her under.\nBy the afternoon, just as scheduled, Thaddeus and Fleur arrived to take her home.\nWhen Arix saw them, she didn’t jump right into asking about the competition. Instead, she wrapped them both in a tight hug, her usual sweet and playful self coming to the surface.\n\"Mom, Dad, you don’t have to come by yourself. I can go back on my own,\" Arix said in her sweetest voice, cuddling into Fleur’s embrace.\nBut Fleur’s smile quickly vanished, replaced by a serious look. She locked eyes with Arix, concern etched into her features.\n\"Arix, what happened? The instructor told me you almost lost your life. Why?\" Fleur’s tone was sharp, cutting straight to the point.\nThaddeus’s expression turned cold too, the protective father ready to take action against any perceived threat.\nSeeing how worried they were, Arix felt a surge of affection and rubbed her head against them, trying to reassure them with her closeness. But the question still hung in the air.\n\"I really don’t know,\" she said, her brow furrowed in confusion. \"If the instructor hadn’t mentioned it, I’d have thought it was just a nightmare. But I think this necklace saved me.\"\nShe lowered her head and showed them the now-broken necklace.\nThaddeus squinted at it, not recognizing what it was. \"What is this?\" he asked, his tone full of suspicion.\nBut Fleur’s reaction was different. Being from the Empire, she recognized it instantly.\n\"This is the Moon’s Blessing,\" Fleur said, her voice tinged with surprise. \"It’s a powerful protective charm, but only the heir to the Empire’s throne is supposed to have one. Arix, did Cassian give this to you?\" Her eyes flickered at the mention of Cassian’s name.\nArix blinked in surprise. She hadn’t expected her mother to know about the necklace. \"Yes, Cassian gave it to me.\"\nFleur’s expression softened slightly, a mix of emotions playing across her face. \"He must care about you a lot. Arix, what do you think of Cassian?\"\nArix shook her head quickly, almost panicked at the thought. \"Cassian’s my best friend.\"\n\"Just a friend...\" Fleur echoed quietly, her voice laced with a subtle disappointment and something else that Arix couldn’t quite place.\n\"Mom, what’s up?\" Arix asked, eyeing Fleur, who seemed lost in thought.\nShe couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off with Fleur today, though she wasn’t sure if she was imagining it.\n\"Nothing, just thinking out loud,\" Fleur replied, brushing off Arix’s concern and quickly shifting the topic. \"If you’re feeling okay, let’s head home.\"\nArix hesitated at the mention of going home. He gathered her courage and looked firmly at her parents, Thaddeus and Fleur. \"Mom, Dad, I want to stay here and continue with the competition.\"\n\"No way, absolutely not,\" Thaddeus immediately objected, his voice firm before Fleur could respond. \"Arix, if it weren’t for what just happened, I might’ve considered it. But if you stay and something dangerous happens again, what then?\"\nHe thought about how much the Kering family had already sacrificed and couldn’t bear the thought of risking his youngest daughter.\nSeeing her usually calm father so upset, Arix didn’t dare push back. Instead, she looked at Fleur, hoping for some support.\nFleur hesitated, but then, to Arix’s surprise, she said, \"If Arix wants to, she can stay and continue the selection.\"\n\"Mom?! Really?\" Arix’s eyes lit up with excitement.\n\"Honey!\" Thaddeus exclaimed in rare frustration.\nFleur gently patted Thaddeus’s hand to calm him. Then, with a smile, she looked at Arix and said, \"But I have one condition.\"\n\"Mom, whatever it is, I’ll agree—even if there are ten conditions!\" Arix declared confidently. After all, this was Fleur, her motehr; there was no reason to worry.\n\"Great, I want you to get engaged to Cassian right away,\" Fleur said, still smiling.\n\"No pro...blem?\" Arix, who had been thrilled just moments before, suddenly realized what her mother had said.\nThe smile on her face vanished, and she stared at Fleur in shock. \"Mom, are you kidding?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 224: Getting Engaged\nFleur shook her head and softly explained, \"Arix, I’m not joking. I would never joke about something this serious.\"\nArix couldn’t believe what she was hearing—was she really being pushed into an arranged marriage?\n\"Mom, are you trying to get rid of me because I eat too much at home?\" Arix asked, tugging at Fleur’s sleeve, feeling a mix of hurt and disbelief.\n\"Honey, this is way too soon. Arix is too young,\" Thaddeus chimed in, clearly not on board with the idea either.\nFleur pulled Arix into a tight hug, tears welling up in her eyes. She gently stroked Arix’s hair and said, her voice breaking, \"Arix, I don’t want this either, but someone warned me that if you don’t get engaged to Cassian this year, you’ll be in danger again. I can’t take that chance. Please understand.\"\n\"But...\" Arix started to argue but stopped when she saw the tears in her mother’s eyes.\nAs ridiculous as it seemed, Arix had a nagging feeling that her mother might be telling the truth.\n\"Honey, are you okay? Why are you saying such crazy things? Cassian might be the Crown Prince, but the Kering family isn’t weak. We can protect our daughter,\" Thaddeus said, concerned for both his wife and daughter.\n\"How can we protect her? Even Arix’s grandfather couldn’t,\" Fleur cried even harder. If there had been another way, she would never have considered getting Arix engaged so young.\nWhen Thaddeus heard that even Arix’s grandfather couldn’t protect her, his expression turned serious. Most people didn’t know the full story, but the leaders of the Alliance were well aware: the Pontifex of the Empire was nearly like a demigod. Even the insectoids treaded carefully around him, which explained why they hadn’t gone all-out against humanity.\nIf someone like that couldn’t protect Arix, then who could?\n\"Honey, is this really the only way?\" Thaddeus asked, his voice rough with tension.\nArix glanced at Fleur, her fists clenched tightly, feeling a mix of nerves and fear.\nFleur, still crying, nodded silently.\nThe room filled with a heavy silence.\nAfter a long pause, Arix forced a smile, her voice shaky. \"Mom, this whole situation is just absurd. Besides, I don’t want to ruin someone else’s happiness for my own. If it comes to that, then maybe it’s just my fate.\"\nFleur broke down into uncontrollable sobs, still desperate to persuade her daughter.\nBut just as she was about to speak, a firm voice cut through the tension from outside the door.\n\"What if I’m willing?\"\nArix looked up in shock, her eyes wide with disbelief.\n\"Cassian? What are you doing here?\" Arix asked, caught off guard and unsure how to feel.\n\"You got yourself into trouble, so how could I stay away? If I hadn’t come, I wouldn’t have known you were being so stubborn.\" Cassian entered the room, his hand gently brushing through Arix’s hair with clear concern.\n\"I’m not stubborn! What are you talking about?\" Arix pouted, her frustration showing.\n\"Right, you’re not stubborn, just a little naive,\" Cassian teased, ruffling her hair even more.\nArix huffed softly but didn’t push back any further.\nAfter soothing Arix, Cassian turned his attention to Thaddeus and Fleur. He respectfully performed the Empire’s customary greeting, then spoke in a humble tone, \"Mr. and Mrs. Kering, I’d like to speak with Arix in private. Could you give us a moment?\"\nThaddeus and Fleur weren’t surprised by Cassian’s arrival—they had been alerted the moment he entered the Alliance.\nThe couple exchanged a glance, silently agreeing, and nodded to the young man. After giving their daughter a few last-minute reminders, they left the room together.\nAs Arix watched her parents leave, a small, embarrassed smile crept onto her face. Turning to Cassian, she said softly, \"Cassian, just forget what I said earlier. I won’t let you sacrifice your happiness for me.\"\nCassian finally let out a laugh, clearly exasperated. Then, without warning, he grabbed the back of Arix’s neck, pulling her close. In one strong, assertive motion, he kissed her deeply.\nArix was stunned.\nIt took a moment before Cassian finally released her, leaving Arix thoroughly stunned. He rested his forehead against hers, his breath a bit ragged but his voice filled with satisfaction. \"You didn’t even ask me. How do you know I wouldn’t be willing?\"\nArix was totally caught off guard when Cassian suddenly kissed her. Her brain hit pause, her body went stiff, and her eyes popped wide open in shock.\nEven after Cassian pulled away, she was still stuck in that stunned moment, struggling to process what just happened.\nCassian couldn’t help but chuckle at how cute Arix looked, completely frozen like that. With a charming grin, he smoothly dropped to one knee. Then he gently took her hand, and placed a soft kiss on the back of it.\nMustering up all his courage, he finally met her gaze.\n\"Arix, I’ve liked you for a long time,\" Cassian confessed.\nIt took a second for Arix to shake off the shock, but as soon as she did, Cassian’s words hit her like a ton of bricks. She swallowed hard, her thoughts still swirling. \"Cassian, we’re still so young. It’s way too early to even think about marriage. We haven’t even gone on a single date. How could we just jump into marriage?\"\nCassian sighed, feeling a mix of frustration and amusement at Arix’s blunt honesty. He closed his eyes for a moment, then opened them with a playful smile. \"Alright, how about we get engaged first? We can date after.\"\nArix was even more puzzled. \"What? Are you just making this up as you go?\"\nCassian laughed again, standing up and looking seriously into her eyes. \"Arix, I swear by the royal name that I’ll love only you for the rest of my life. So, will you marry me?\"\nArix was stunned by his sudden seriousness, but she quickly snapped back to reality. \"Cassian, isn’t this a bit premature? To our parents, we’re still kids.\"\nCassian let out a sigh, half-joking, \"What kind of kid weighs over 80 kilograms?\" Then, rubbing his forehead, he smiled as if surrendering. \"Okay, we can hold off on the marriage talk, but the engagement is something your parents are expecting. You can’t just say no.\"\nHis tone grew firmer when he mentioned the engagement. It wasn’t just a casual suggestion; it was about Arix’s safety. Whether she agreed or not, Cassian decided this was one time he had to be a little selfish.\nArix didn’t immediately shut down the idea. Instead, she hesitated, torn. She looked up at Cassian, the young man who’d always held a special place in her heart.\nHis looks had made her swoon from the moment they met.\nBut the thing that held her back was their age. No matter how perfect or genuine their feelings seemed, they felt as fragile as a sandcastle at the beach.\nAnd then there was Cassian—so incredible in every way. Arix couldn’t promise herself she wouldn’t fall even harder for him in the future.\n’But what if Cassian finds someone else, someone he truly loves later on?’\nJust the thought of Cassian leaving her for someone else sparked a flicker of jealousy. It wasn’t that her feelings were all that deep yet, but her imagination was already working overtime, stirring up anxiety.\nIt was like getting so wrapped up in a novel or TV show that you start living the characters’ emotions, feeling every bit of their highs and lows.\nArix was still deep in her thoughts, unaware that her conflicted expression was sending all the wrong signals to the young man in front of her.\nCassian, who had started out hopeful, felt his heart sink as the silence dragged on. He watched Arix’s face, seeing hints of resistance, and it hurt more than he could have imagined.\nHis thoughts spiraled as he wondered,\n’Does Arix not even like me a little? Even if it’s to save her life, she still wouldn’t want to be engaged to me?’\nBelieving his worst fears were true, Cassian felt a bitter taste rise in his throat, and his face lost all color.\nYet, he clung to a sliver of hope, forcing a lighthearted smile as he tried to lighten the mood. \"Arix, am I really that bad? You’ve been thinking for so long.\"\n\"Huh?\" Arix blinked, momentarily confused before snapping back to reality. She quickly smiled, a bit embarrassed. \"Oh, no, Cassian. It’s not that you’re bad—it’s that you’re too good, and that’s why I’m hesitating.\"\n\"Re-really?\" Cassian’s pale cheeks flushed with warmth, and he suddenly felt like he was bursting with energy, as if someone had flipped a switch inside him.\nArix nodded, then hesitated before sharing what was really bothering her. \"Cassian, you’re handsome, and you come from such a powerful family. If you get engaged to me, wouldn’t you be losing out? I just want you to be happy, not tied down by some obligation.\" She looked down, feeling guilty for holding him back.\n’He must be pushing himself to do this just to protect me,’\nArix thought, her heart heavy.\nMeanwhile, Cassian felt like his head might explode from the confusion.\n’I’m worried you don’t want to be engaged, and you’re worried I’m settling for less?’\nHe couldn’t believe what he was hearing.\nHe wanted to shake some sense into Arix, to see if she was just messing with him. But in the end, he couldn’t bring himself to do anything so harsh.\nInstead, he sighed deeply, placed his hands gently on her shoulders, and spoke with a firm, serious tone. \"Arix, listen to me. I’d be thrilled to get engaged to you. The only thing I’m worried about is whether you really want it. If, someday, things changed, I... I’ll let you go.\"\nCassian wasn’t sure what he felt as he said those last words. As much as he wanted to keep Arix close, her happiness and freedom meant more to him than anything.\nBut Arix completely misinterpreted his words. She thought he was saying HE might change one day and that he’d let her go when the time came.\nThinking she was getting the better end of the deal, Arix immediately nodded, her worries vanishing as she cheerfully agreed.",

      "content": "Chapter 225: Training Going On\nSo, in a twist of fate, they somehow ended up engaged, though it wasn’t exactly a smooth journey.\nWhen Thaddeus and Fleur heard the news, their emotions were all over the place. It didn’t help when they saw Cassian’s mother on the screen, grinning like she just won the lottery. That sight sent a sharp twinge through their hearts.\nCassian, the Crown Prince of the Sacred Moonlight Empire, and Arix, who carried the title of the Hope of the Alliance were now officially engaged.\nWhat seemed like a simple engagement was actually much more—a strategic move that tied the two most powerful nations in the galaxy together. This wasn’t just about a wedding; it was about the future of two superpowers, leaving everyone wondering how this new bond would play out.\nEven though there was excitement in the air, the actual ceremony was still a good six months away.\nWhile top officials from both the Empire and the Alliance were locked in heated debates over where the couple would stay, Arix and Cassian were reluctantly parting ways at the special training base’s entrance.\nAs the Empire’s Crown Prince, Cassian couldn’t stick around the Alliance for long. After wrapping up his tasks, he was set to return home. He had hoped to bring Arix along for a visit, but she declined, insisting on continuing her special training, leaving Cassian with a look of quiet disappointment.\n\"Cassian, the mecha competition is in six months, and you’re leading the Empire’s team. We can’t just focus on having fun. We’ve both got to train hard so we can perform well together in the competition,\" Arix said, her eyes shining with determination as she clenched her fists.\nCassian sighed as he looked at her, oblivious to the bigger picture. But he decided to let it go. They were engaged now; maybe love would follow in its own time.\nAfter Cassian left, Arix stood there, her hand on the necklace around her neck.\nThe gemstone, now a brilliant blue, had miraculously repaired itself after Cassian had let a drop of his blood fall onto it. She couldn’t help but wonder what might happen if she did the same. But, worried she might damage the Moon’s Blessing, she pushed the thought aside.\nShe carefully tucked the necklace away and headed back to the training base.\nHer first stop was Kellan’s office to check in and let him know she was okay. Then, she made her way to the second training field.\nWhen Spears, her coach, saw her return, he smiled like he’d been expecting her all along. \"You’re back. Feeling better?\" he asked gently.\n\"Yes, Coach. I’m fine now, thanks,\" Arix replied with a polite nod.\nSpears gave her a slight nod in return, his eyes drifting toward the exit of the training field. Today was the final day of the intense seven-day training session. He couldn’t help but wonder how many students had made it through.\nJust then, the exit to the Dimensional Training Field burst open, and a flood of special forces soldiers and military students came pouring out.\nAt that moment, they all looked like they had just endured a month of survival challenge in the wilderness. Their clothes were torn to shreds, and their bodies were covered in wounds.\nSome were even missing limbs, with intestines spilling out from their bellies.\nThe medical robots, who had been waiting on the sidelines, quickly sprang into action. They moved the severely injured as if they were handling cargo. For those with less severe injuries, the robots simply used a healing device, restoring them to health in no time.\nThere were quite a few injuries.\nArix wasn’t sure about the special forces, but on the military student side, three were missing. She figured they hadn’t made it through the training and had probably been eliminated by the instructors.\nArix didn’t feel particularly sorry for them, considering she had almost been eliminated herself. She scanned the crowd carefully and was relieved to see that her friends were all healthy and unharmed.\nDrexel, who had just emerged, immediately began searching for Arix.\nAfter looking around, he finally spotted her standing next to the instructor, looking clean and well-rested, in stark contrast to everyone else.\nDrexel was so confused. He assumed Arix must have come out early, which likely meant she had been eliminated.\nFeeling sympathetic, he walked over to Arix, patted her on the shoulder, and said, \"Arix, you got eliminated, didn’t you? Don’t worry about it; it’s just a competition. I’ll win a championship for you later!\"\nArix gave Drexel a confused look, wondering if he was having another one of his moments.\nSince Arix didn’t respond, Drexel assumed he was right and sighed heavily.\nArix ignored him, but Spears, who had been watching, suddenly smiled faintly. In a sinister tone, he said, \"I heard that, Drexel. If you don’t win a championship, I’ll give you personal training for two weeks.\"\nDrexel’s eyes widened in shock. \"Sir, were you eavesdropping?!\"\n\"Eavesdropping or not doesn’t matter,\" Spears replied. \"What matters is that I heard you, and I’m taking it seriously. So, Arix, I’m counting on you!\" He patted Drexel’s shoulder, who now looked utterly defeated.\nAfter teasing Drexel, Spears reminded them to meet at 8 a.m. the next day, then left the training field with the special forces instructor.\nArix was about to leave too, but she noticed Drexel, who looked like he had turned to stone. Feeling a bit sorry for him, she explained, \"By the way, dear brother, I did NOT get ELIMINATED.\"\nShe emphasized each word to make sure he understood.\nDrexel trembled, staring at Arix in disbelief, before coughing up blood and fainting on the spot.\nA medical robot, seeing Drexel pass out, promptly came over and carried him away.\nArix, watching her brother faint from shock, nervously rubbed her nose.\n\"Arix.\"\nA voice suddenly called her name, sounding like it came from a demon.\nArix’s face instantly paled, and she quickly ran off in fear.\n\"Hey, Arix, why are you running? We’re roommates; let’s go back together!\" Quinnie called out, confused.\nBut Arix didn’t slow down. Instead, she ran even faster, fleeing the scene as quickly as possible.",

      "content": "Chapter 226: Sneaky Attack\nTime zipped by, and before anyone knew it, five months of intense special training had come and gone.\nIn this whirlwind of nearly six months, Spears had shown everyone what real special training was, using methods that would make any cruel instructor proud. It didn’t matter if someone was missing an arm, had a broken leg, or was running on fumes—if they were still breathing, they had to get back up and keep going.\nUnder this relentless pressure, the military students who once fumbled around when faced with wild beasts had transformed.\nNow, they were as tough as the legion’s special forces.\nArix, for example, was currently piloting Star Dust and had just wiped the floor with a special forces soldier who challenged her, sending him flying out of the arena without breaking a sweat.\n\"Not bad at all!\" Spears said, clapping hard. Then, with a firm voice, he added, \"Next one, let’s keep this going.\"\nNo sooner had the words left his mouth than another special forces soldier, also in a mecha, stepped up to face Arix.\n\"What? Another one? Sir, can I catch a break?\" Arix whined through her headset, frustration written all over her face. She had just taken down two soldiers, and the thought of facing another one made her want to crawl under a rock. Her small frame simply couldn’t handle much more.\nBut Spears wasn’t having any of it. The slight smile on his face vanished, replaced by a cold, unforgiving stare. \"A break? Even the laziest farm dunkey don’t slack off like you. Quit whining! Say one more word, and I’ll throw another challenger your way,\" he warned in a voice that could freeze fire.\nArix shut herself up immediately.\nRealizing she had no way out, Arix rolled her eyes, then swiftly moved her mecha to launch an attack. Her moves, fueled by the frustration of someone stuck in an endless loop of overwork, made the soldier facing her gulp nervously. He quickly maneuvered his mecha to dodge her strike.\nAfter dodging, the soldier countered with a skillful shot from his energy gun, unleashing a barrage of fire at Arix. But she remained calm, expertly controlling her mecha and gliding across the arena. Her smooth, agile movements allowed her to dodge the storm of bullets with ease.\nA few rounds later, Arix spotted an opening. She quickly circled behind the soldier and landing a heavy blow on his mecha.\nKnowing he was outmatched in close combat, the soldier immediately backed off, letting loose another wave of intense firepower.\nArix, who had been gearing up to finish him off, clicked her tongue in annoyance and started dodging again.\nCompared to her earlier days, when she was almost riddled with holes, Arix now dodged most attacks with ease, relying on her skills rather than the mecha’s energy shield.\nSpears watched the fight closely, nodding with satisfaction. The progress his students had made over the past few months was clear as day, and Arix, in particular, had surprised him more than once.\nHe had always thought she had potential, but he never expected her combat skills to catch up to her brother Drexel’s so quickly. Not only had she closed the gap in strength, but her battle instincts had also sharpened.\nShe knew when to hold back and when to go all in.\nImpressive, indeed.\nAfter offering his feedback, Spears turned his attention to the other students in the arena. The first thing that caught his eye was Arix’s brother, Drexel, who was using a move called the \"Low Blow.\"\nSpears was speechless. He rubbed his temples, feeling an impending headache.\n’How on earth has Drexel, a kid from a long line of soldiers, picked up such a sneaky and downright ridiculous move?’\nAnd the most baffling part? He was trying to \"Low Blow\" a mecha.\nFrustration bubbled up inside Spears. This move wasn’t just useless—it was downright embarrassing. And who was the one feeling embarrassed? Drexel’s instructor, Spears, of course.\nBut, much to his surprise, the mecha Drexel was up against hesitated at the sight of this absurd tactic, instinctively trying to dodge.\nIn that brief moment of confusion, Drexel pounced on the opportunity and sent his opponent flying out of the arena.\nSpears stood there, utterly speechless, the words he wanted to say stuck in his throat.\nFinally, with a twitch of his mouth, he decided it was best to just move on to the next student. As long as they won, he could always deny ever teaching Drexel that ridiculous move.\nThankfully, apart from Drexel’s creative detour, the other military students were still on the right track.\nElio, for instance, had a style that involved all expensive equipment, but at least it wasn’t dirty or dishonorable.\nOverall, Spears was mostly satisfied. So, when the special training wrapped up, he did something rare—he spoke in a gentle tone, praising the students. \"Not bad. If you keep up this level of combat readiness, our Alliance’s mecha squad is bound to secure a top-three spot in this year’s competition.\"\nThe students lit up with excitement, some already daydreaming about how they’d brag about their victory once they got back to the academy.\nSpears looked around at the remaining twenty or so students. He let them enjoy this moment of happiness before continuing, \"The competition is only two weeks away, so Kellan and I have decided that we’ll officially select ten team members and three alternates the day after tomorrow. Be prepared. Gather here at 8 a.m. for the final selection. You’re dismissed.\"\nWith that, Spears left the training ground.\nOnce the coach was gone, the students, who had been holding on by a thread, wasted no time in trickling out of the arena.\nArix now felt both physically and mentally drained, so she said her goodbyes to her friends.\nShe planned to head back to her dorm for a much-needed night of sleep, wanting to be well-rested and ready for the selection two days later.",

      "content": "Chapter 227: Unprecedented\nThe military students was finally convinced. They quickly settled down, their eyes focused on the instructor, ready to listen.\nSeeing the students had finally calmed down, Spears didn’t waste any more time. He pulled up a video file on the opticomputer and played it without delay.\nAs the video began, he turned to the class with a serious tone, \"This is an official instructional video from the Military Research Institution. It covers the process of awakening Psychic Incarnation. Just follow along with what you see.\"\nThe students nodded and started watching the video intently.\nArix was also glued to the screen. Although she didn’t need to awaken Psychic Incarnation herself, her curiosity about the Academy’s method kept her attention locked in.\nAmong all the students, Elio and his group were the most taken aback. They had heard whispers from their families that ordinary people might someday be able to awaken Psychic Incarnation, but the details had always been murky.\nNow, with the opportunity right in front of them, they watched the video with just as much interest as everyone else.\nSo, whether or not they had already awakened Psychic Incarnation, every student focused on the screen.\nArix recognized the instructor in the video that was explaining how to awaken Psychic Ware. He was the same older man from the Military Research Institution who had once explained the psychic power healing potion during a live broadcast.\nIf Arix remembered correctly, his name was Noland.\nDespite the time that had passed, Noland was still as lively as ever. His face glowed with pride as he prepared to dive into the explanation of awakening Psychic Ware.\nAfter a few deliberate coughs to clear his throat, he stared straight ahead, his intense gaze making it feel as though he was looking directly at each student.\n\"Hello, I’m Noland, the director of the Military Academy. Today, I’m here to explain the Psychic Ware that can help you awaken Psychic Incarnation.\" Noland’s tone was serious and formal.\nBut in the blink of an eye, it was like he flipped a switch. His face brightened with an almost obsessive excitement. \"Before we dive into the details, I want to take a moment to praise the two individuals responsible for this groundbreaking invention. While I can’t share their identities due to certain constraints, I can tell you that their contributions rival those of the five founding heroes of the Alliance. One of them is especially extraordinary, without precedent or equal in history...\"\nHe went on like this for a full ten minutes, leaving the students thoroughly perplexed. They exchanged confused glances and eventually looked to their instructor for clarification.\n\"Is this really an instructional video?\"\nSpears rubbed his forehead in frustration, letting out a helpless sigh.\nHe’d already raised concerns with the Military Academy about this, but since the video had been approved by the entire Academy, there was little he could do.\nHe figured they could treat it like a commercial break and just endure it.\nThe students shared awkward looks, none more so than Arix, who found herself the unintended subject of the praise.\nWhat started as a shy blush turned into a deep crimson as she tried to shrink into herself. The situation wasn’t helped by Drexel, who knew the truth and kept sneaking amused glances her way, barely holding back his laughter.\nArix was so mortified she wished she could vanish into thin air. Through this painfully awkward experience, she learned a harsh truth: when some people give compliments, they really don’t consider how it might make others feel.\nJust as Arix was about to hit her breaking point, Noland in the video finally got a nudge from the cameraman, reminding him that this was supposed to be an instructional video, not a tribute speech.\nReluctantly, Noland shifted gears, cutting off his endless praise to focus on the actual purpose of the video—explaining how to awaken Psychic Incarnation.\nEveryone let out a collective sigh of relief and tuned in, ready to learn.\n\"First, take the Psychic Wares in your hand,\" Noland instructed, his tone now serious and focused. \"Close your eyes, and slowly guide the energy from the Ware into your psychic world...\"\nFollowing his lead, all the military students closed their eyes and concentrated, diving deep into their psychic worlds.\nTime ticked by slowly until, suddenly, one of the students broke the silence with a shout of excitement.\nUnable to hold back her joy, she summoned her freshly awakened Psychic Incarnation—a tiny, fluffy hamster that appeared in her palm.\nThough it was just a small hamster, she didn’t mind at all. In fact, she cuddled it with so much affection that it would have been a sweet scene if not for the hamster’s clearly reluctant expression.\nAs more time passed, the room buzzed with energy as more and more students successfully awakened their Psychic Incarnations. There were all sorts of creatures—cats, leopards, and even a pig...\nArix, intrigued by the variety, withdrew her gaze from the pig and began stroking her chin thoughtfully.\nA pattern was starting to form in her mind: it seemed that the more powerful the Psychic Incarnation, the later it emerged.\nAs more time passed, the Psychic Incarnations that appeared became increasingly formidable, mostly fierce animals.\n\"Arix, check out my Psychic Incarnation! Isn’t it the cutest?\" Deanna suddenly dashed over, her face lit up with excitement as she showed off a white rabbit nestled in her arms.\nArix glanced at the adorable bunny, happily munching on a carrot, and flashed a thumbs up. \"Absolutely adorable,\" she agreed.\n\"Yup, I think so too.\" Deanna beamed, giving her rabbit a gentle pet before turning her curiosity back to Arix. \"Arix, where’s your Psychic Incarnation?\"\n\"Oh, I almost forgot! It’s still in my psychic world,\" Arix replied, suddenly realizing she hadn’t called out her own. Not wanting to be left out, she mentally asked her three little ones who wanted to come out for the competition.\nIn the blink of an eye, Cupid was the first to appear. The small winged tiger leaped into Arix’s arms and, in a friendly gesture, raised a paw toward Deanna with a soft, \"Awooo.\"\nDeanna’s eyes widened with delight as she eagerly shook Cupid’s paw. \"Arix, your Psychic Incarnation looks just like your beast form!\" she exclaimed in surprise.\nArix nodded, affectionately stroking Cupid’s fur, feeling a warm connection between them.",

      "content": "Chapter 228: That Terrifying Man\nAs the two friends chatted away, time seemed to fly by. Once the last student had finally awakened their Psychic Incarnation, Spears stood up, ready to take charge.\n\"Alright, everyone, get ready for the competition,\" he announced, stepping into his role as the referee.\nBefore the competition began, Arix thought they’d be drawing lots to set the order for the matches. But instead, Spears just started rattling off names.\n\"Varden, Zephyr, Cirilla, Elio, Arix, Drexel, Marceau... step forward.\" Spears called out the names of five heirs along with Arix.\nThe others were the top military students, each with a Psychic Incarnation, handpicked by Spears.\nArix, caught off guard, glanced at the others. Though a bit puzzled, he stepped up with them, joining the front row.\nSpears quickly checked the Psychic Incarnations they held. After confirming something, he made an announcement: \"You ten will each defend a ring.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" Arix and the others responded, giving a salute before moving to their positions on the rings.\nWith the defenders chosen, Spears turned to the rest of the military students. \"In three hours, the ones still standing on these rings will be the final participants in the mecha tournament. You’ve got three hours to challenge them. Win and hold the ring until the end, and you’ll take their spot in the tournament. I now declare the selection matches open!\"\nAfter the announcement, Spears headed back to the main platform. The moment he left, the other students looked at each other, and then, like a pack of hungry wolves, they charged towards the rings.\nSeeing this, Arix and the others called on their Psychic Incarnations, gearing up for the battles ahead.\nOn the platform, as Spears took his seat, the base commander spoke up with a bit of doubt, \"Isn’t it odd to focus on Psychic Incarnations when this is a mecha tournament?\"\nSpears just shrugged and flashed a mischievous grin. \"I never said we weren’t focused on mechas. The ten students on those rings are the best when it comes to mecha skills.\"\nThe base commander caught on and chuckled. \"Smart move. You’re getting two results for the price of one.\"\nSpears gave an innocent smile but said nothing.\nFeeling reassured, the base commander turned his attention back to the rings, watching the students closely. Then, something caught his eye, and he smiled. \"That girl is a surprise. I didn’t think her Psychic Incarnation—a small rabbit—would stand a chance. But it’s actually got some serious fight in it.\"\nHearing this, Spears and Kellan also focused on the rabbit Psychic Incarnation. The rabbit’s opponent was a massive tiger, towering over the tiny creature. It looked like a clear mismatch.\nBut the outcome stunned everyone. Just as the tiger lunged, jaws wide, the small rabbit leaped up, holding a carrot. It smacked the tiger on the head with the carrot, and the fierce predator immediately froze and collapsed, stars circling around its head.\nEven Spears was a bit taken aback. He turned to look at Deanna, the girl behind the rabbit. With her mecha skills, she should’ve been one of the ten defending the rings, but her gentle-looking Psychic Incarnation had made her seem like a poor fit.\nDeanna, with her impressive mecha skills, was initially meant to be among the ten defending the rings. But because her Psychic Incarnation appeared to be just a small, harmless-looking rabbit, Spears hesitated. Instead, he chose a slightly less skilled student to take that spot.\nHowever, as the competition unfolded, Spears realized he had seriously underestimated her.\nAs the hours ticked by, the five heirs stood their ground, each one unchallenged on their rings.\nOf the other five, Arix was the only one who held his position from start to finish. The others faced multiple challenges and had their spots taken over a few times.\nThe base commander watched it all with a conflicted expression. After a long silence, he turned to Kellan and remarked, \"Even when other kids awaken their Psychic Incarnations, they can’t compete with the five. There’s still some gab.\"\nThe commander wasn’t being dismissive, just stating a harsh truth. The Psychic Incarnations of the noble families were no ordinary beings: the Kering family boasted a holy tiger, the Lasair family had a mythical dolphin, the Brant family claimed a nine-tailed white fox, the Rinn family wielded a divine phoenix, and the Calix family controlled a legendary eagle.\nIn contrast, even Deanna’s courageous rabbit turned meek in the face of these powerful creatures. Before the battle even began, it had already surrendered, lying down in defeat.\nThe base commander’s expression darkened as he pondered,\n’With such powerful families dominating, will ordinary people in the Alliance ever truly have a chance?’\nKellan, noticing the commander’s unease, responded with a gentle smile, as if not sharing his concerns. \"If the five families were weaker, do you think the Alliance would enjoy the stability it has now?\"\nSome people, protected from the harshness of the world, believe they could handle things just as well or even grow bitter at the seeming unfairness. But put them in those positions, and they’d struggle to protect even themselves, let alone others. The consequences could be disastrous.\n\"Rear Admiral Kering, please forgive me. I was being shortsighted,\" the base commander said, suddenly realizing how narrow his thoughts had been.\nNoticing the commander’s regret, Kellan maintained his gentle smile and offered some advice. \"You’ve been stationed at this small base for three years now, haven’t you? Perhaps it’s time you saw more of the outside world. After the selection ends, why not visit the front lines?\"\nThe base commander nodded, suddenly feeling enlightened. \"I understand. I’ll apply for a transfer to the front lines right away. Thank you, Rear Admiral Kering, for your advice,\" he said, his gratitude clear. Being stuck in this small base for so long, he had indeed forgotten the bigger picture.\nSpears, observing the entire conversation, couldn’t help but admire Kellan’s skill. He had managed to get the commander to strip himself of comfort and still be thankful for it.\n’What a terrifying man,’\nSpears thought.",

      "content": "Chapter 229: Group Fight\nSpears shook his head, deciding to tune out the chatter around him. His focus shifted back to the arena.\nSure, the heirs had a clear edge when it came to their Psychic Incarnations, but that didn’t mean other kids were completely outclassed.\nTake the scene playing out now, for example. The rabbit had surrendered without a fight, flopping onto the ground in defeat. Deanna gave it a swift kick, and with a stern look from its owner, the rabbit reluctantly offered a carrot to the powerful tiger standing before it.\nDrexel watched, amused, as the little rabit stood there, somehow managing to look both terrified and oddly brave at the same time.\n\"Why not just give up? No need to let your Psychic Incarnation get hurt,\" Drexel suggested, hoping to spare the little rabbit.\n\"Don’t worry, I never expected to win. I just wanted to see the difference between the Psychic Incarnations of you noble heirs and us,\" Deanna replied, fully aware of her limits.\nShe had surrendered earlier on purpose, switching from defender to challenger. Only a fool would miss out on such a perfect chance to learn.\nDrexel, catching on to her plan, grinned. And with that, their Psychic Incarnations squared off.\nThough calling it a \"fight\" might be a bit generous. The tiger didn’t even bother acknowledging the rabbit. Instead, it simply put up a psychic power barrier and lazily went back to sleep.\nSo, the arena was left in a strange mix of frantic energy and utter calm.\nThe frantic energy came from the little rabbit furiously pounding on the barrier, while the calmness radiated from the tiger, peacefully dozing.\nWatching Deanna’s clever strategy, Cirilla, ever the battle enthusiast, felt a spark of inspiration. She glanced at her own empty arena, then spotted a classmate walking by. With a sweet smile, she called out, \"Come on up.\"\nThe guy blinked in confusion. \"Huh?\"\nHe had just been there to watch the five heirs’ Psychic Incarnations, not to get himself beaten up.\nBut when Cirilla shot him a threatening look, he had no choice but to climb onto the platform. Three seconds later, both he and his Psychic Incarnation were sprawled on the ground.\nCirilla, clearly unimpressed, pouted. To everyone’s surprise, she deliberately surrendered and stepped down from the platform. Then, without missing a beat, she made her way straight toward Elio’s platform.\nElio and his dolphin Psychic Incarnation went pale. \"Don’t come over here!\" he shouted in a panic.\nBut Cirilla didn’t give them a chance to escape. She took them both down, leaving them bruised and battered before stepping off the platform. She seemed satisfied with her handiwork.\n\"Who’s next?\"\nCirilla’s eyes sparkled mischievously as she scanned the platforms, clearly on the hunt for her next target.\nMeanwhile, Arix couldn’t help feeling sorry for his own partner.\nAfter nearly three hours of fierce fighting, even Cupid, strong as he was, was starting to show signs of fatigue.\n\"Cupid, maybe it’s time to let Vita and the others take over,\" Arix suggested telepathically.\n\"It’s alright, Arix, I’ve got this,\" Cupid replied, though his tiny paws trembled as he faced off against the menacing crocodile Psychic Incarnation.\nArix knew Cupid could keep going for a bit longer, but there was no need to push it. If Cupid got hurt, it wouldn’t be worth it.\nSo, seeing Cupid struggle, Arix made a quick decision.\nHugging Cupid close, she called out Sophia.\nThe military student across from them, who had been so sure of his victory, didn’t even have time to process what was happening before another Psychic Incarnation materialized.\n\"You... you... how do you have two Psychic Incarnations?\" the military student stammered, his eyes darting between Sophia on the ground and Cupid in Arix’s arms.\n\"Is that a problem?\" Arix asked, genuinely puzzled.\n\"Of course, it’s a problem! This is a gang fight! It’s not fair!\" the military student protested, his frustration bubbling over.\n\"Did the instructor say we couldn’t use two Psychic Incarnations?\" Arix blinked innocently.\nThe student opened his mouth to argue but found himself at a loss for words. There really wasn’t a rule against it.\n\"Seems like it’s fine, then. Let’s keep going. Sophia, you’re up!\" Arix said, and with that, Sophia launched into action.\nCompared to Cupid, Sophia’s attacks were quick and ruthless. In just a few moves, she sent the student flying off the platform.\nThe spectators, including the other students and instructors, watched in stunned silence as Sophia displayed her power.\n\"Rear Admiral Kering, your sister sure knows how to keep things interesting,\" Spears remarked, clearly impressed by the sight of Arix handling two Psychic Incarnations.\nKellan’s eyes sparkled with pride as he smiled. \"She’s always been one-of-a-kind.\"\nSpears couldn’t help but chuckle at Kellan’s blatant lack of modesty, but he let it slide.\nWhile the instructors and onlookers were pleasantly surprised by the display, the students who had planned to challenge Arix were anything but.\nRealizing they’d have to face not one but two Psychic Incarnations, they quickly decided to find a different platform to challenge. No one was eager to face what they now saw as an unfair advantage.\nIn the end, most of the students who stuck around Arix’s platform were there just to watch the action unfold.\nOnce word spread that she had two Psychic Incarnations, no one dared challenge her.\nWhen the three-hour event wrapped up, Arix smoothly secured her spot on the national mecha team.\nThe final lineup for the national mecha team included the heirs of the five major families, Arix and her brother Deanna, as well as a girl named Lydia and a boy, Marco.\nThe alternates were the top three remaining students, two of whom were from Koros Military Academy, with Quinnie being the sole representative from HMA.\nArix was a bit surprised to see Quinnie as an alternate, especially since her strength seemed on par with Arix’s own. But later on, Arix learned that Quinnie didn’t have a Psychic Incarnation, which explained why she wasn’t a main team member.\nWhile it was unexpected to find out that some students didn’t have a Psychic Incarnation, Arix didn’t think too much of it. After all, Kellan didn’t have one either.",

      "content": "Chapter 230: The Terrifying Cooking\nOnce the participant list for the mecha competition was revealed, Spears officially called an end to the grueling special training.\nWith the date and place set for their next meet-up, he gave all the students a much-deserved week off.\n\"Uncle Marlone, we’re heading out,\" Arix and Drexel said as they exited the training base. They offered to drop Deanna and her brother off at Marlone’s place on their way home.\n\"Why the rush? Stay and have lunch with us,\" Marlone replied, smiling warmly.\nArix and Drexel shared a quick, silent glance, both recalling the \"lunch\" Marlone had once packed for them.\nThat meal was etched in Arix’s memories—so unforgettable it could only be compared to the horror of Sister Gwen’s cooking.\nIt didn’t take long for the siblings to politely refuse. \"No thanks, Uncle. We’ve got other plans, so we’ll just head home.\"\nThe fear of Marlone’s well-meaning hospitality sent them scrambling into their Lev, speeding off as if their lives depended on it.\nWatching Arix and Drexel vanish in an instant, Marlone assumed they were just being polite, not wanting to inconvenience him.\nWith a chuckle, he turned to his newly adopted kids and said, \"Deanna, Marceau, you two haven’t eaten yet, right? Come on, let me show you what your dad can whip up.\"\nBoth Deanna and Marceau suddenly felt a wave of dread, recalling the urgency with which Arix and Drexel had fled just moments earlier.\nThey didn’t need to think too hard to realize that Marlone’s cooking might be... well, questionable.\nDeanna’s eyes darted around before she put on her sweetest, most thoughtful smile. \"Dad, you just got back too. Isn’t it a bit much to ask you to cook? How about we just order some pizza instead?\"\nThough Marlone was thrilled to be called \"Dad\" for the first time, he still gave them a serious look and said, \"No pizza! You deserve something better after the traning.\"\nTouched by how much Marlone cared, Deanna couldn’t argue anymore and just hoped her gut feeling was wrong. Maybe Arix and Drexel had something urgent to attend to, and that’s why they left in such a hurry...\nMeanwhile...\nThe fleeing siblings finally breathed a sigh of relief, their hearts calming down after the close escape.\n\"Should we warn Deanna and Marceau?\" Arix asked, her voice tinged with sympathy as she tried to settle her nerves.\n\"No need. I already gave them a heads-up while we were making our escape. But whether they manage to get out of it... well, that’s another story,\" Drexel said, shivering at the thought of Marlone’s culinary creations.\nMarlone’s cooking ranged from bad to downright terrifying.\nThe merely bad dishes were somewhat manageable—you could choke them down if you had to. But the truly awful ones...\nStuff like jellied eels, liver and blood pudding, deep-fried insects, raw chicken sashimi, pickled eggs, and blood sausage...\n\"Ugh...\" Drexel almost lost it again just thinking about the time he was forced to drink worm soup.\nArix felt nauseous too, remembering her unfortunate encounter with the green pea and ham soup.\nIt wasn’t just the taste—it was the aftermath. After drinking it, she discovered the green chunks were actually peeled caterpillar proteins.\nFor three whole days, everything Arix looked at seemed like it was crawling with bugs, and she couldn’t stomach a single thing.\nShe dropped several pounds before she finally started feeling normal again—a clear testament to just how dangerous Marlone’s cooking could be.\nSeeing Arix’s pale face, Drexel felt a wave of guilt wash over him. He had forgotten to give her a heads-up earlier, and it nearly cost Arix a meeting with God too soon.\n\"Sis, we really need to find Uncle Marlone a wife who knows her way around a kitchen. It’s kind of sad that he’s stuck eating his own cooking every day,\" Drexel said, poking fun at Marlone’s cooking skills, then immediately felt a little bad for the guy.\nMarlone was well aware of his cooking skills, but he never let anything go to waste. He’d stash the leftovers in the fridge and make sure to finish them himself.\nThe more Drexel thought about it, the more he pitied Marlone.\n’Why is this bothering me so much?’\nArix nodded in agreement. \"You’re right! We should definitely find someone. If we come across the right person, we’ll set her up with Uncle Marlone.\"\n\"True, but let’s not rush it. There’s always someone out there more desperate than we are,\" Drexel said with a sly grin.\nArix didn’t need any further explanation; she knew exactly who Drexel was talking about.\nBesides Deanna and her brother—who were likely having a rough time right about now—no one else came to mind.\nStill, there wasn’t much Arix could do for them. Poor Deanna—Marlone was her dad now, after all. His affection might be overwhelming, but at least it wasn’t dangerous.\nArix tried to suppress a smile.\nTheir home wasn’t far off, so it didn’t take long for Arix and Drexel to arrive.\n\"That’s weird. Mom usually waits for you at the door,\" Drexel said, raising an eyebrow when he noticed the empty entrance.\nTypically, their mom would have been standing by the door, eager to greet Arix the moment she arrived.\nArix glanced at Drexel and teased, \"What’s the matter? Are you so grown up now that you still need Mom to welcome you home?\"\n\"Ha! That’s you, not me,\" Drexel shot back, not missing a beat.\nThe two kept up their playful banter as they headed toward the house.\nBut when they walked into the main hall and still didn’t see Fleur, Arix began to feel a bit puzzled herself.\nIt was strange—Mom wasn’t one to go out often.\n\"Mr. and Miss Kering, you’re home! Lunch will be ready shortly. How about some appetizer while you wait?\" Evelyn, the Kering family’s maid, said as she set two bowls of dessert on the hall table, smiling warmly at them.\n\"Evelyn, have you seen Mom and Dad?\" Arix asked, curiosity piqued.\n\"They have gone to the Empire,\" Evelyn replied, uncertain but giving her best guess.\n\"The Empire? What would Mom and Dad be doing there?\" Drexel asked, a bit distracted, not realizing that his sister already had a hunch.\nArix, on the other hand, had a pretty good idea. Cassian had mentioned they were working out the details for the engagement. Her parents were probably in the Empire to finalize those plans.",

      "content": "Chapter 231: Sweet Soup\nIt was like the universe wanted to back up Arix’s gut feeling—her mom called at that exact moment.\n\"Mom,\" Arix said sweetly, answering the video call with a soft smile.\nFleur’s response came back with just as much warmth. Her eyes crinkled with affection as she asked, \"Arix, did you just get home?\"\n\"Yeah, Drexel and I just got back. Evelyn’s making us some lunch,\" Arix replied with a small laugh, keeping things light and easy as they talked about home.\n\"Good, have your lunch first. Afterward, you and your brother should come over to the Empire,\" Fleur suggested warmly.\n\"Wait, what?\" Arix blinked in surprise but didn’t push for details. Instead, she just nodded and agreed, \"Okay, Mom.\"\nBut Drexel, who had been quietly listening, wasn’t so thrilled. \"Mom, we JUST got back, and we haven’t even had a chance to relax.\"\nHe had his mind set on gaming after lunch, not making some trip across the galaxy to the Empire.\nFleur, however, wasn’t in the mood for his complaints. Her tone turned icy, and there was a sharp edge to it. \"You want to rest? How about I give you a good spanking and arrange for you to rest in bed for half a year?\"\nDrexel gulped nervously, immediately backing down. \"Uh, right! Just remembered, I’ve got something to take care of at the Empire too. See you after lunch, Mom.\"\nArix laughed at his quick surrender. She steered the conversation to something more cheerful before she and Fleur wrapped up the call.\nOnce the video call ended, Drexel slumped into his chair, a look of frustration clouding his face. \"Mom must be bored out of her mind. I get why she has to go to the Empire, but why drag us along? The mecha competition is right around the corner, and now we’re stuck doing this.\"\nArix, sensing his reluctance, offered kindly, \"You don’t have to go if you don’t want to. I can handle it myself.\"\nAfter all, this was about her engagement, and her brother’s presence didn’t really matter THAT much.\nBut instead of feeling relieved, Drexel shot her a confused look. \"Wait, why do you need to go to the Empire anyway?\"\nHe absentmindedly scooped up a spoonful of sweet soup and took a sip.\nJust as the flavor hit his taste buds, her answer made him nearly choke.\n\"Oh, nothing too crazy, just going to get engaged,\" Arix replied nonchalantly, sipping her soup with a contented look.\n\"Pfft!!!\"\nDrexel sputtered, coughing for a solid few seconds. When he finally caught his breath, he stared at his sister in disbelief. \"What did you just say you’re doing at the Empire?\"\n\"Getting engaged. To Cassian,\" Arix replied, calm as ever, still enjoying her sweet soup.\nDrexel froze for a moment before slamming his hands on the table, fury radiating off him in waves.\nWithout a word, he grabbed Arix’s arm and started pulling her toward the door.\n\"What are you doing? I haven’t finished my sweet soup!\" Arix protested, glancing back longingly at her half-eaten dessert.\n\"Sweet soup! Is that all you care about? You’re about to be sold off, and you still have an appetite?\" Drexel, for once, completely lost his cool.\nSeeing him so mad, Arix kept quiet, letting herself be dragged along.\n\"Mr. and Miss Kering, aren’t you going to finish the soup?\" Evelyn called out as she brought another dish to the table, only to see the siblings rushing out.\n\"We’re skipping it. We’ll just have some nutritious fluid instead,\" Drexel snapped, still fuming. \"After all, we’re so poor we’re selling off our daughter. We don’t deserve to eat real food.\"\nEvelyn watched Drexel storm off, a mix of confusion and curiosity etched on her face. \"I’ve never seen the him this mad,\" she commented softly, more to herself than anyone else.\nMeanwhile, on the jump ship.\nDrexel sat, arms crossed, his expression dark and brooding. His usually warm eyes were now icy cold.\nArix hesitated, chewing on her lip before finally speaking up. \"Drexel, I think you might be misunderstanding. My engagement to Cassian... it’s something I agreed to...\"\nBut she couldn’t say for sure if Cassian was just as willing.\nBefore she could continue, Drexel cut her off, his voice tight with emotion. \"It doesn’t matter if it’s voluntary or not, Arix. You’re only too young, and still studying! How could Mom and Dad let this happen? We just found you after losing you for decades , and now they’re trying to marry you off?\"\nHis voice cracked on the last word, and, much to Arix’s surprise, tears welled up in his eyes. He was struggling to make sense of it—how their parents could be okay with their sweet baby girl getting engaged.\n’Are they really putting some kind of advantage over family?’\nHis thoughts spiraled, and in that moment, a crimson hue clouded his vision as his psychic power surged wildly, spiraling out of control.\nIn the psychic realm, Sheer, who had been dozing, snapped awake, sensing the sudden turmoil. \"Drexel! What’s going on? What happened?\" Sheer’s voice was urgent, but no response came from Drexel.\nIn the real world, Arix quickly noticed something was very wrong. Without wasting a second, she wrapped them both in her psychic energy, using Vita’s power to try and calm the storm raging inside Drexel.\n\"Drexel, snap out of it! I’m not the one being forced here—Cassian is!\" Arix yelled, her voice cutting through the chaos as she focused on soothing his psychic energy.\nDrexel, in the midst of his outburst, suddenly froze when he heard that. The violent surge of his power faltered, and a flicker of clarity returned to his eyes.\nIn his psychic realm, Sheer let out a relieved sigh as the disturbance around them began to settle. Muttering, Sheer drifted back to sleep.\nDrexel blinked, his voice still rough with emotion as he asked, \"Arix, what did you just say? Cassian’s the one being forced?\"\nSeeing Drexel finally calming down, Arix relaxed too and nodded, taking a deep breath before explaining everything from the beginning.\nThe more she explained, the more Drexel frowned, his face scrunched up in disbelief. \"Are you seriously telling me Cassian’s like... some rare safety raft you’ve gotta marry to keep you from crumbling?\"\n\"Why would I lie? Mom and Dad know all about it too. Cassian’s already given up so much for me. So when we get to the Empire, don’t make things harder for him,\" Arix said, her tone protective.\nDrexel fell in silence.\nNow, he was starting to believe that Cassian really was getting the short end of the stick.\nThe engagement hadn’t even happened yet, and Arix was already defending him like this.\nBut knowing that Arix wasn’t being coerced, Drexel finally felt at ease. As for Cassian being the one forced?\nWell, Drexel thought with a smirk, if Cassian was being forced by Arix, he might as well count himself lucky.",

      "content": "Chapter 232: Meeting In The Empire\nOnce the misunderstanding was cleared up, Drexel started feeling a twinge of guilt about abandoning the lunch still waiting for him back home.\n\"Arix, next time you’ve got something important to say, could you spill it sooner? I haven’t even had lunch yet,\" Drexel grumbled, trying to shift the blame.\nFor the past six months, getting to enjoy Evelyn’s cooking again had been a rare treat. And now, thanks to a twist of fate, he’d missed out.\nWhen Arix heard about the lunch, she pouted, looking even more upset than Drexel.\n\"You didn’t even give me a chance! You looked ready to snap someone’s neck the whole way here. How was I supposed to say anything?\" Arix muttered, her voice weak as she touched her empty stomach.\nOn the jump ship, eating was a no-go, but you could drink nutritious fluid. Unfortunately, she hadn’t packed any in her Space Button, so hunger was her current companion.\nDrexel didn’t have any of that fluid either, but he ducked out for a bit and returned with two strawberry-flavored ones.\n\"Where’d you get these?\" Arix asked, brightening up as she took one and looked at him curiously.\n\"Traded for them, of course. We’re not the only ones on this ship,\" Drexel replied like it was the most obvious thing in the world.\nThen, with a curious look, he asked, \"Arix, I’ve been wondering. With how innocent and trusting you are, how did you survive on Planet Waste all these years?\"\nPlanet Waste wasn’t as deadly as Planet Void, but it was still no walk in the park. Without a sharp mind and a cautious nature, you might not even realize how you ended up dead.\nBut with Arix’s pure-hearted nature, it seemed more likely she’d spent the last ten years being coddled by a big, protective family rather than toughing it out on Planet Waste.\nArix awkwardly touched her nose, unsure how to respond. The truth was, the real Arix had lived on Planet Waste for ten years. But her? She’d always lived in a loving family, whether in the interstellar world or the present day. She was used to the care and affection of her elders and younger relatives. Hardship wasn’t really in her playbook.\nEven during summer jobs, her overprotective family made sure she only worked in their own pharmacy so they could keep an eye on her. It was more of a life experience than an actual job.\nLuckily, Drexel seemed to pick up on her hesitation and, not wanting to press further, changed the subject. \"Never mind. You’re fine as you are. Let’s not dwell on the past. We’ve arrived at the capital planet of the Empire of Sacred Moonlight, Arix. Time to get off.\"\nArix nodded, grateful for her brother’s understanding. She didn’t really want to keep secrets from Drexel, but explaining everything was just too much. It involved time travel, soul exchange, and a mysterious grandpa...\nJust thinking about it made her tired, so she decided to keep things under wraps.\nAs soon as the two stepped off the warp machine, they were greeted with a pleasant surprise—standing on the platform, waiting for them, were their older brother Kellan and their cousin Targon.\n\"Kellan! Targon!\" Arix and Drexel called out in unison. Excitedly, they rushed forward, each taking one side of Kellan for a big, joyful bear hug.\nTargon stood off to the side, feeling a bit left out as the two hugged Kellan. Realizing he wasn’t getting any love, he awkwardly pulled his arms back and gave himself a small, self-comforting hug.\nMeanwhile, Kellan held his brother and sister close, his calm, handsome face softening with a warm smile. \"Alright, alright, you two are grown now. Stop acting like kids.\"\nAfter clinging to Kellan for a bit longer, Arix finally let go, her eyes sparkling with mischief. \"Kellan, why are you in the Empire too? Is Grandpa here as well?\"\n\"Grandpa had to stay home to take care of things, so he couldn’t make it. I had some time off, so I decided to come,\" Kellan explained, still smiling.\n\"Tsk, tsk, poor old man! Can’t even make it to his own granddaughter’s engagement party. How tragic!\" Drexel teased, though there was a touch of sympathy in his voice.\n\"Huh? We’re all here in the Empire, but we left Grandpa behind. Won’t he be mad at us?\" Arix asked, a sudden wave of guilt growing inside her.\nKellan thought of their grumpy old grandfather and chuckled knowingly. \"Who knows?\"\n\"Alright, enough about Grandpa. Arix, Drexel, let’s head back. Everyone’s waiting for you,\" Kellan said, his voice gentle.\n\"Yeah! The family even prepared a big welcoming feast. As soon as you’re home, we can start eating!\" Targon added eagerly, practically drooling at the thought of the feast waiting for them. He quickly pulled out his Lev and motioned for the three of them to get in.\nHearing about the feast, Arix and Drexel, who had only had a single nutritious fluid to drink, perked up immediately. They exchanged a quick glance before both scrambled into the Lev, excited at the thought of a real meal.\nAs for their grandfather back in the Alliance, he was completely forgotten in their excitement over the feast.\nKellan, still standing there, shook his head with a fond smile before joining them in the Lev.\n...\nIn their rush to grab a bite, Arix and the crew quickly made their way back to the Tiger Clan.\nThe welcome feast was already underway in the clan’s main hall. By the time Targon led them inside, the long table was buzzing with guests. Everyone from the Tiger Clan had already settled in, snacking on food and exchanging stories.\nThe moment Arix walked in, the room lit up with excitement. Clan members flocked around her, their voices overlapping in a chorus of questions and concern.\n\"Arix, how’s life over at the Alliance?\"\n\"Arix, is anyone giving you trouble there?\"\n\"Arix, dear, why don’t you just stay in the Empire? You’ve lost so much weight since you went back to the Alliance. Your second grandfather’s beside himself with worry.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 233: Back To The Tiger Clan\nArix answered each question with patience, aware of the thinly veiled disapproval for the Alliance in their words. Yet, she kept her responses positive, offering a few kind words about her home back at the Alliance, all while maintaining a warm smile.\nAfter what felt like an endless stream of questions, Arix finally found a moment to sit down, choosing a spot next to Drexel.\n\"You really have lost weight, Arix. Make sure to eat plenty,\" said Krylak from the head of the table, his smile full of warmth and pride for her. Arix, after all, was the clan’s shining star.\n\"Will do,\" Arix replied, her smile sweet and sincere.\nNearby, Fleur and Thaddeus exchanged a glance, taken aback by the outpouring of affection the Tiger Clan had for Arix. Their fondness for the clan grew as they watched the scene unfold.\nAs the feast officially kicked off, the bond between the Kering family and the Tiger Clan grew even stronger. They shared drinks, food, and laughter, the atmosphere becoming more and more like that of one big, happy family.\nArix had expected to see Scion at the feast, but as time passed and he was nowhere to be found, her worry deepened. Her thoughts drifted to a recent, unsettling dream, prompting her to reach out to Targon through her opticomputer.\n\"Arix: Hey, Targon, where’s Scion? I haven’t seen him around today.\"\nTargon, mid-bite, paused at the sound of his opticomputer pinging. He read the message and quickly typed a reply.\n\"Targon: He’s over at the Moon Goddess Temple. He’s about to become the Pontifex, so he couldn’t make it.\"\nArix’s heart skipped a beat as she read his response. Scion had told her he wouldn’t take on the role of Pontifex. ’Has he been forced into it? Or has he not been honest with me from the start?’\nShe clenched her fists, not in anger, but out of worry.\n’Is Scion under pressure from the Moon Goddess Temple? And what does this mean for Grandpa’s position?’\nAfter a deep breath, she sent another message to Targon.\n\"Arix: What’s going on? Why is Scion suddenly becoming the Pontifex? And is my grandfather okay?\"\n\"Targon: I’m not sure. Outsiders aren’t allowed in the Moon Goddess Temple, but I heard that the temple’s elders asked your grandfather to step down. Scion’s the next candidate for Pontifex, so he left with the temple folks two days ago.\"\nTargon assured her, \"If Scion becomes the Pontifex, your grandfather will definitely come back to the Tiger clan. The clan leader will likely arrange for us to bring him home, and we can all go together.\"\nIn the Empire, becoming the Pontifex is a huge honor for the clan, so Targon wasn’t too worried about Scion leaving with the Moon Goddess Temple. In fact, he felt a mix of pride and happiness over it.\nBut Arix couldn’t shake off her unease. Something about the situation felt wrong.\nAfter sending a quick reply to Targon, she set her opticomputer down, her mind spinning with thoughts.\n’What could have happened at the Moon Goddess Temple that they were in such a hurry to replace the Pontifex?’\nArix had a strong sense that if Scion took on the role, something terrible would follow.\n’But how can I stop it?’\nShe dropped her head, lost in thought.\n\"Arix, Arix...\" Krylak’s voice cut through her thoughts, snapping her back to the present.\n\"Yes?\" Arix asked, trying to push aside her worries as she looked at him with confusion.\n\"I heard you’re getting engaged to that boy, Cassian?\" Krylak asked, sounding casual.\n\"Yes, after the mecha tournament, we’ll have the engagement party,\" Arix answered, her mind still elsewhere.\n\"Haha, that’s just a month away. Cassian made a smart move. Arix, you won’t regret this engagement. His talent, strength, and character are all solid,\" Krylak said with a warm smile, clearly approving of Cassian.\nIf Arix was the bright hope of the Alliance, then Cassian was the Empire’s pride. With his exceptional talent and strength, boasting both psychic and physical power at the Supergiant+ level, Cassian was a standout. Most notably, he was the only pureblood royal born in nearly a thousand years. To Krylak, Cassian was more than worthy of his niece.\nArix returned his smile but kept quiet. If it weren’t for what Fleur had said, she wouldn’t have agreed to this engagement so soon. It wasn’t that Cassian wasn’t a good match—he was. But Arix felt they were all too young to be tied down by marriage. At this stage in their lives, learning and growing should be the priority, not romance.\nBut...\nArix glanced around at her clan members, who were eagerly discussing the engagement, and at Thaddeus and his wife, who were beaming with joy. In the end, she just lowered her head and kept her thoughts to herself.\n...\nAfter the welcoming feast, Arix made her way back to the cozy room that the Tiger Clan had arranged for her.\nShe knew she needed to get some rest, with a visit to Cassian’s parents and the task of choosing her engagement dress on the schedule for tomorrow. So, she decided to call it a night early.\nBut sleep didn’t come easily. Her mind was swirling, and when she finally drifted off, she found herself caught in a dream. In it, she was standing in front of the grand Moon Goddess Temple.\nThe place was alive with energy. A festival seemed to be in full swing, and the temple’s entrance was packed with therians, all buzzing with excitement. Their faces were lit up with joy, but try as she might, Arix couldn’t make out what they were saying.\nThen, the doors of the Moon Goddess Temple swung open. First came eight knights on beasts, leading the way. Behind them, a stream of believers in priest robes flowed out of the temple.\nSome carried baskets brimming with flower petals, scattering them as they walked. Others played lively music, while a few danced with ceremonial objects.\nArix stood there, confused, unable to grasp what was happening at the temple.\nIt wasn’t until she saw twelve believers carrying a lavishly draped white carriage that the pieces started to click. This was the ceremony for the new Pontifex’s inauguration.\nStanding alone in the sea of people, Arix felt a wave of sadness as she locked eyes on Scion, seated in the carriage. He wore the ornate robes of the Pontifex, yet his cold face remained unchanged.\nScion, who had once sworn to Arix that he wouldn’t take the role of Pontifex, had now accepted the position.\nAs the celebratory procession moved further away, Arix remained frozen, lost in thought. But then, she snapped out of it and quickly made her way toward the Moon Goddess Temple.\nHer pace slowed only when she reached the hall dedicated to the Moon Goddess. Cautiously, she approached the entrance, intent on sneaking a peek inside. Just as she got close, a loud shout rang out from within.\nThe sudden noise made Arix jump, her heart racing. She nearly collapsed in fright. Taking a moment to steady herself, she pressed her ear against the door, trying to catch what was being said.\n\"Vezgor, oh Vezgor, who would’ve thought you’d end up like this? How does it feel to be crippled and stuck in a wheelchair?\" Ignathor’s voice, once so careful and respectful toward Vezgor, was now dripping with arrogance and delight.\nOutside the hall, Arix’s eyes widened in shock. The man who had once been so powerful—her grandfather—was now crippled.\nShe clenched her fists, trying to suppress the urge to burst in.

      "content": "Chapter 234: Vezgor’s Death\nInside, Vezgor no longer looked like the strong figure he once was. He looked frail, like a shadow of his former self, slumped in a wheelchair, enduring Ignathor’s taunts.\n\"Still ignoring me, huh? You’re ignoring me even now? Do you still think you’re the all-powerful Pontifex? You’re nothing now, just a bug I can crush whenever I please,\" Ignathor snarled, his voice tinged with bitter anger.\nBut Vezgor remained silent, eyes closed. He refused to acknowledge the man taunting him.\nIgnathor ranted for a while, but then a shift came over him. His face settled into a smug grin as he said, \"Vezgor, do you know why I haven’t ended your life yet? Because I want you to witness the terrible fate of the one you’ve been protecting for ten long years.\"\nTo drive the knife deeper, Ignathor started spilling the secret that Vezgor had kept under wraps all those years. In response, Vezgor’s frail hand suddenly clenched into a fist, and his breathing became heavier.\nNoticing this, Ignathor’s smirk only grew. \"You really are the picture of a devoted grandfather,\" he mocked. \"You betrayed the Moon Goddess, faked divine oracles, defied the gods, and even gave up your own longevity—all for her. And now, look where it’s gotten you.\" His voice dripped with twisted admiration.\n\"Enough! This is my burden alone. I’ll bear the consequences,\" Vezgor finally spoke, his voice raspy and weak, like it could break apart at any moment.\nBut Ignathor wasn’t done. \"You may want me to stop, but I have more to say. You, Vezgor, didn’t want Scion to become the Pontifex because you feared that the gods would descend and strike down your precious granddaughter. You even hoped, foolishly, that the royal bloodline could shield her once you were gone,\" Ignathor said, leaning in closer, his words sharp as daggers. \"But too bad, I made sure Scion took the role early, just so you could live long enough to see your granddaughter’s downfall.\"\nOutside the hall, Arix bit her lip so hard it started to bleed, tears streaming uncontrollably down her face.\nTen years. Her grandfather had risked everything to protect her for ten years.\nAs the pieces fell into place, Arix realized that the time she spent in the previous world—what she once thought was a mysterious, accidental journey—was actually her grandfather’s desperate act of rebellion against the gods. He had sacrificed everything to send her there, to keep her safe.\nThe mysterious old man who had always lingered in her thoughts now had a clear, familiar face.\nArix’s emotions surged, a chaotic mix of tears and laughter, but she kept silent. She couldn’t let anyone inside know she was there.\nShe needed to hear the whole truth first. Only then could she have a shot at saving both herself and her grandfather.\n\"Ignathor! How dare you!\" Vezgor shouted, his voice trembling with rage as he realized that ten years of his hard work were about to be ruined.\nBut with his strength all but gone, the thought of killing the arrogant man before him was out of reach. He couldn’t even send a message for help.\nThe overwhelming sense of hopelessness washed over him as he slumped back into his wheelchair, finally surrendering to the situation.\n\"Hahaha!!!\"\nSeeing the once-mighty Vezgor now broken and defeated at his feet, Ignathor let out a triumphant laugh. To twist the knife even further, he casually taunted, \"Oh, and isn’t Scion about to become the Pontifex soon?\"\nVezgor remained silent, lying limp in the chair as if he were already dead.\nIgnathor didn’t care. Amused by his own cruelty, he continued, \"Once Scion takes on the role of Pontifex, the god will erase his soul, turning him into a weapon to kill your granddaughter. They were close, weren’t they? Imagine that—being killed by someone you love. What a hopeless, terrible fate. I almost pity her.\"\n\"Feel sorry for her? Then you should just die!\"\nIgnathor’s smirk froze on his face.\nHe looked down, horror-stricken, to find a massive hole in his chest. Struggling to comprehend what had happened, he slowly turned his head to see Arix standing there.\nHer eyes was glowing blood-red, her entire being radiating pure, deadly intent.\n\"You... you...\" Ignathor stammered, trying to speak, but death overtook him. He collapsed to the ground, eyes wide in shock, He couldn’t believe his end had come so suddenly.\n\"Arix...\" Vezgor called out weakly, astonished by the sight of his granddaughter.\nArix’s murderous look disappeared as she rushed to her grandfather’s side. She dropped to her knees and cried in a rough, choked voice, \"Grandpa, are you okay?\"\nVezgor struggled to lift his hand, gently patting Arix on the head with a faint smile. \"I’m okay, my dear. You did well.\"\n\"Grandpa, don’t lie to me. You’re dying. Please, tell me how I can save you. What can I do?\" Arix clutched his hand tightly, her voice laced with desperation.\nBut Vezgor’s body was already withering away, and Arix knew deep down there was nothing she could do to save him.\nShe frantically went over everything she had ever learned, searching for a way out, but nothing could stop the inevitable.\nShe couldn’t stand the thought of being powerless, of watching her grandfather slip away.\nBut unlike Arix, Vezgor wasn’t afraid. He shook his head gently, offering her comfort instead. \"Arix, don’t be sad. I have no regrets. I’m actually happy because I’m about to see your grandmother again. I’ve been waiting for this day, waiting to—\"\nBefore he could finish, Vezgor’s frail hand fell, lifeless.\nArix stared at her grandfather’s still form, his breath now gone. She closed her eyes as tears streamed down her face. She wanted to collapse, to cry out in agony, but Ignathor’s words echoed in her mind.\nOnce Scion officially becomes the Pontifex, the god will erase his soul...\nThe words slithered through her thoughts like a venomous whisper, driving her to bite her lip until it bled. Steeling herself, she knelt one last time before her grandfather, then turned and bolted in the direction of Scion.\nThere was still time. Everything could still be saved!\n’Scion, wait for me!’\nThe ceremony for the new Pontifex’s ascension was held on the highest mountain of Imperial Nexus, a place of awe and reverence.\nArix, having been there once before, navigated her way through the winding paths and towering spires until she reached the site of the ceremony.\nPushing her way through the dense crowd, Arix finally made it to the altar.\nThe ceremony was already in its final stage, with everyone anxiously waiting for Scion to take his place on the holy throne—a symbol of the ultimate power and honor of the Pontifex.\n\"Your Holiness...\" the officiant, noticing Scion’s hesitation, cautiously reminded him, urging him to take the final step.\nScion, however, ignored the officiant’s words. He stood there, staring coldly at the throne that represented supreme honor, his mind elsewhere.\n’How absurd,’\nScion thought. This so-called honor had cost him everything. He had been abandoned by his parents as a child because of it. He had been forced to reject everyone’s kindness, push away those who cared for him, and deny himself even the simplest joys of life.\nAnd now, this honor demanded his life.\nScion knew that becoming the Pontifex meant the end of his soul, a death far more final than any other. So, instead of bringing hope or love into his life, he had chosen to keep everyone at arm’s length—to avoid hurting them and himself.\nWith a weary sigh, Scion closed his eyes, the weight of his fate pressing heavily on him.\nWhen he opened them again, his resolve hardened, and he finally began to move.\nOne step, two steps, three steps...\nThe crowd watched in tense silence, expecting him to take his seat on the throne. But at the final step, Scion did something no one anticipated.\nInstead of sitting down, he drew a shining longsword from the Space Botton hidden in his sleeve.\n\"Your Holiness, what are you doing?\" the officiant cried out in terror, fearing that Scion was about to plunge the sword into his own chest.\nGasps rippled through the crowd as they realized something was terribly wrong. All eyes were on Scion, frozen in shock as the scene unfolded before them.\nBut Scion didn’t drive the sword into his chest. Instead, he slowly raised it to his neck, the blade gleaming in the light, poised to end his life.",

      "content": "Chapter 235: Scion Killed Himself\n\"Scion!\"\nArix burst into the room, still wrestling with how to stop Scion from becoming the Pontifex. But what she saw next made her blood run cold—Scion, poised to take his own life.\n\"No! Don’t do it!\" Arix cried out, her voice shaking with fear.\nScion hesitated, just for a heartbeat. His once vacant eyes seemed to catch a flicker of something—maybe life, maybe regret. But even as he glanced at the girl sprinting toward him, his grip on the sword didn’t loosen.\nHis lips moved, forming words Arix couldn’t catch. Then, with a resigned sigh, he closed his eyes and let the blade slice through his throat.\nFor a brief moment, the world stood still. Every breath was held, eyes wide in horror as Scion moved to end it all.\nSome tried to reach him, to stop him, but they were too late. All they could do was watch as his blood stained the sacred throne of the Pontifex, soaking Arix’s clothes in the process.\nArix felt her legs give out beneath her, collapsing to the floor in despair. Her once bright, starry eyes were now hollow as they stared at the tragic scene.\nThe Scion who had once been so proud, so pure, now lay crumpled and bloody, like a broken doll discarded by fate. The air around him seemed to hum with death and sorrow.\nAfter what felt like an eternity, Arix raised her trembling hands. They were drenched in blood, the red so vivid it almost hurt to look at. She shuddered.\n\"Why...\" she whispered, her voice barely more than a breath. \"Why wouldn’t you let me save you...?\"\nHer lips quivered as she kept muttering, lost in her own despair.\n...\n\"Arix, Arix, wake up...\"\n\"Did you have a nightmare? You were crying so hard you nearly passed out.\"\nA familiar voice echoed through her mind, but before she could piece it together, a sharp sting on her cheek jolted her awake.\n\"Ouch...\" Arix winced, clutching her throbbing cheek.\nDrexel, realizing she was finally awake, quickly hid his hand behind his back, looking a bit sheepish. \"Arix, what kind of nightmare was that? Your face is all puffy from crying.\"\n\"Puffy from crying or from being slapped? You tell me,\" Arix shot back, glaring at Drexel. But she was too drained to argue. The nightmare had sucked the life out of her.\nLately, every dream was about death—hers or someone she loved. If this kept up, she wasn’t sure she’d have any family left to dream about.\nArix rubbed her temples, a wave of frustration crashing over her.\n\"Sorry, don’t be mad,\" Drexel mumbled. \"I called your name a bunch of times, but you were so lost in that nightmare, I couldn’t wake you. I got worried, so I...uh...gently slapped you a few times...\"\n\"Yeah, real gentle,\" Arix said, sarcasm dripping from her words. She was grateful he woke her, but her aching cheek made her want to strangle him just a little.\n\"Uh, anyway, Cassian’s waiting for you downstairs. You should go see him when you’re ready. I’ve gotta go,\" Drexel added, practically bolting for the door before Arix could say anything else. He knew if their mother found out about the slap, he’d be in serious trouble.\nArix watched the door close with a thud, sighed, and then called Sylvana from her psychic realm.\n\"Arix, do you need my help?\" Sylvana asked softly, concern etched in her eyes as she looked at her.\nArix nodded, then poured out her worries about the relentless nightmares.\n\"Sylvana, are these just dreams?\" Arix’s voice trembled, fear creeping in.\nEverything in those dreams felt too real, like she was actually living them.\nSylvana stayed silent for what felt like an eternity before finally letting out a soft sigh. \"Arix, this isn’t just a dream. It’s the future.\"\n\"The future?\" Arix felt a shiver run down her spine, her hands turning icy cold. Panic flared in her voice as she quickly asked, \"Does that mean my grandfather will die? And Scion too?\"\nSylvana nodded, her expression heavy. She spoke gently but firmly, \"Arix, even though you don’t yet wield the full power of the real Sylvana, no ordinary nightmare could ever reach you. It’s impossible for you to have random dreams unless something significant in the future is about to affect you. That’s why you’re having these prophetic dreams.\"\nThe memory of the blood and death in her dreams made Arix’s fists clench tight. In a strained voice, she asked, \"Can the future be changed?\"\nSensing Arix’s desperation, Sylvana was quick to reassure her. \"Most people might be powerless to alter the future, but you’re different. As a sacred beast, you’re a favored child of the heavens. As long as it doesn’t upset the balance of the world, the almighty God usually turn a blind eye to what we do.\"\nArix finally let out a long breath, a hint of a smile tugging at her lips. \"That’s good, that’s really good. Sylvana, do you have any idea when this dream will come true?\"\nSylvana shook her head, her tone laced with regret. \"I’m sorry, Arix. I can’t say for sure, but it usually happens within a few days or, at most, a few months.\"\n\"Okay, I understand. Sylvana, I’m fine now. You can rest,\" Arix said, offering a grateful smile.\n\"Alright, call on me if you need anything,\" Sylvana replied. Then she transformed into a stream of light, disappearing back into Arix’s forehead.\nAs soon as Sylvana was gone, Arix’s smile faded. A nagging feeling told her the events in her dream would unfold within days. Leaving her grandfather alone at the Moon Goddess Temple didn’t sit right with her. It seemed she would need to make a trip to the temple herself.\nOnce Arix had made up her mind, she wasn’t about to waste a second.\nAfter a quick moment of thought, she decided to head to the palace with Cassian first, then make her way to the Moon Goddess Temple. But later a question came into her mind: once she got there, what could she possibly do to save her grandfather and Scion?\nHer mind was so tangled with worries. Cassian immediately noticed her troubled expression the moment he saw her.\n\"Arix, is there something I can help with?\" Cassian’s eyes, warm and tender, were filled with concern.\nArix, halfway through her breakfast, glanced up at him. Even though she felt a bit unsure, she finally asked, \"Cassian, I don’t want my grandfather or Scion to become the Pontifex. Is there a way?\"\nCassian’s smile brightened even as his eyes darkened slightly at the mention of Scion’s name. \"Why would you even think about that? Being the Pontifex is an honor, a sacred duty.\"\nMeanwhile, Drexel, happily enjoying his breakfast beside Cassian, suddenly felt a chill run down his spine.\nLooking up, he saw Cassian smiling, all sunshine and cheer. But something about that smile made Drexel uneasy, like a creeping sense of danger. For once, he decided it was best to stay quiet and focus on his breakfast.\nArix wasn’t surprised by Cassian’s response. Most people in the Empire saw the Pontifex role as a great honor, something only a fool would refuse. But Arix knew better. Anyone could take on the title—anyone except her grandfather and Scion.\nThen, a thought struck her like a bolt of lightning—If anyone could become the Pontifex, why not her? If she stepped into the role, she could protect both her grandfather and Scion.\nCassian, who had been carefully watching her, noticed the sudden spark in her eyes. A wave of panic dumped him. ’Is she considering becoming the Pontifex herself? But if she does, we can never marry!’\nHis heart raced with fear. \"Arix, we’re about to get engaged soon. Do you have any preferences for the ceremony?\" he asked gently, trying to steer her thoughts away from this dangerous idea.\nHe couldn’t let anything or anyone, especially not Scion, ruin their future.\nThe word \"engagement\" brought Arix back to reality. If she became the Pontifex, she could never marry Cassian.",

      "content": "Chapter 236: Changing The Future\nOver the past six months, she had come to understand just how much Cassian cared for her. If she called off their engagement now, he’d be devastated. She knew Cassian shouldn’t have to pay the price for her need to save her grandfather and Scion. Besides, the thought of spending her life locked away in the Moon Goddess Temple didn’t sit right with her.\nWith a sigh, Arix rubbed her temples, feeling the weight of her decision. In the end, she decided to abandon the idea of becoming the Pontifex herself.\n\"As for the ceremony, I’m okay with anything. I’ll leave it up to you,\" Arix replied, sounding tired.\nCassian’s mood instantly lifted. But seeing the worry still etched on her face, he gently pressed, \"Arix, why don’t you want your grandfather or Scion to become the Pontifex?\"\nHe knew this was something they couldn’t avoid discussing. Better to address it now than be blindsided later.\nEven Drexel, who had been quietly eating, chimed in, \"Yeah, Arix, hasn’t Grandpa always been the Pontifex? Why the sudden change of heart?\"\nArix hesitated, then decided to share the truth with them.\n\"I had a dream... In it, my grandfather and Scion were in danger. My grandfather gets framed by someone named Ignathor, and Scion... he takes his own life on the day he becomes Pontifex. I can’t let that happen, so I don’t want them to take on the role.\"\nAs she spoke, her voice laced with anxiety, Drexel suddenly burst into uncontrollable laughter.\n\"Haha! Oh, this is killing me! Cassian, did you hear that? My sister actually thinks her dream is real! This is just too much!\" Drexel was laughing so hard he even gave Cassian a playful slap on the shoulder, clearly finding the whole thing hilarious.\nCassian, however, kept his cool. His face remained composed, though his eyes softened as he looked at Arix.\nHe figured she was just spooked by her nightmare, letting it mess with her head. Still, there was something endearing about how worried she looked—part of him wanted to reach out and reassure her.\nBut as Drexel’s laughter grew louder and more over-the-top, Arix finally had enough. Her patience snapped without a word. Her eyes narrowed, and suddenly, a powerful Supergiant-Class mental force swept through the dining room like a storm.\nDrexel, caught mid-laugh, froze. The grin vanished from his face, and he quickly straightened up in his chair.\nCassian, too, adjusted his posture, swallowing hard. This was the first time he’d seen Arix truly angry, and it was chilling.\nWith the room now silent, Arix took a deep breath before speaking in a steady, serious tone. \"I’m not joking. In the next few days, my grandfather will die, and so will Scion. I don’t want them to die.\"\nThe intensity in her voice was undeniable, and for a moment, Drexel still found it hard to believe. But as he saw the almost tearful determination on her face, the reality of the situation began to sink in. Joking around was one thing, but their grandfather’s life was another matter entirely.\nIn the end, Drexel decided to take her seriously.\nCassian, on the other hand, didn’t care whether it was real or just a bad dream. If Arix believed it, then so did he.\nNow that the three of them were finally on the same page, Drexel was the first to speak up. \"Arix, you said that if they don’t become the Pontifex, we can save them, right?\"\nArix nodded quickly. \"Yes, as long as Grandfather stays in the Moon Goddess Temple, he’s in danger. And if Scion becomes the Pontifex, he’ll die—either by someone’s hand or his own.\"\nDrexel thought about this for a moment, then turned to Cassian. \"You know the Empire better. What do you suggest?\"\nCassian, clearly uneasy, cleared his throat. Suddenly, his expression shifted to something fiercer, and he made a threatening gesture across his neck as if to slice it.\nArix and Drexel stared at him, shocked.\nThey couldn’t believe what they were seeing. Sure, the Moon Goddess Temple had made its share of mistakes, but wiping it out? That was too much. Besides, for therian children to become fully human, they needed to undergo a ceremony led by the Pontifex to receive the Moon Goddess’s blessing. Both Arix and Drexel had experienced that blessing themselves, so they knew just how vital it was for the Empire’s people.\nAs they scrambled to figure out how to convince Cassian, he suddenly laughed and said, \"Relax, I was just kidding. I wouldn’t do something as crazy as destroying our main source of power.\"\nArix and Drexel both sighed in relief, though they shot Cassian annoyed looks.\nCassian, amused by how much more tense they were than he was, let his smile linger. \"Since Grandfather and Scion are out of the running for Pontifex, we’ll need to pick someone new. But...\"\nCassian paused.\nDrexel, growing impatient, urged him, \"But what? Just spit it out already.\"\nArix felt his heart tighten with worry.\nCassian hesitated a moment longer before saying, \"It’s one thing to get your grandfather out of the Moon Goddess Temple, but with Scion... that’s a different story.\"\nIt wasn’t jealousy or pettiness driving Cassian. Scion wasn’t just the favorite for the Pontifex role—there were deeper, hidden reasons at play.\n\"Why? Scion’s good, but he’s not irreplaceable,\" Drexel said, confused.\n\"That’s not the issue,\" Cassian sighed. Then, he dropped a bombshell, something only the royal family and top members of the Moon Goddess Temple knew.\nWhen Drexel heard it, his eyes went wide with shock. \"Wait, are you saying Scion is a future god?\"\nCassian nodded. \"Yep. This is top-secret info. My father told me that on the day Scion was born, the Moon Goddess Temple received a divine decree. It declared that Scion is the vessel the god chose for himself in this world. When he becomes the Pontifex, he’ll inherit all the god’s powers.\"\n\"That’s... incredible,\" Drexel said, a bit envious.\nInheriting a god’s powers meant Scion would basically become a god himself. Drexel thought about this, then cautiously asked Arix, \"Arix, are we sure we want to stop him from becoming the Pontifex? That doesn’t sound like a bad deal.\"\nDrexel couldn’t help but think that if someone tried to block his path to such power, he’d bury them alive.\n\"Inheriting a god’s powers... but would he still be Scion after that? Cassian, if you could gain all a god’s powers but lose your soul in the process, would you still want it?\" Arix asked with a cold smile.\nIf she hadn’t had that prophetic dream and learned the truth, she might have thought this was a good thing.\nDrexel and Cassian exchanged a glance, the seriousness of the situation sinking in.\nThe room grew tense again. Finally, Cassian shook his head, defeated. \"If we can’t deal with the Moon Goddess Temple, the only way to stop Scion from becoming Pontifex would be to find someone even the temple can’t defy. Otherwise, it’s impossible.\"\nWith the Moon Goddess Temple’s power and influence in the Empire, challenging it seemed like an impossible task.\n\"I doubt we’ll find anyone like that. Who’s the one that the Moon Goddess Temple wouldn’t dare to defy?\" Drexel said, feeling discouraged.\nCassian sighed, suddenly feeling a twinge of sympathy for Scion. If he’d known his rival in love was in such a tough spot, he might’ve been kinder to him before.\nBut unlike the other two, Arix seemed lost in thought, touching her chin as if she was onto something.\nArix’s mind raced as she pieced it all together. \"An existence that even the Moon Goddess Temple can’t defy—could that be the Moon Goddess herself? And if the Moon Goddess is Sylvana, who is also... me? Then I’m the one the Moon Goddess Temple cannot resist.\"\nHer eyes suddenly sparkled with realization.\n’Of course!’\nShe’d been thinking too small. All this time, she’d been focused on becoming the Pontifex, on working for the Moon Goddess Temple. But why aim for that when she could aim higher? Why not become the boss—the Moon Goddess herself?\nShe could become the Moon Goddess. Why settle for just being the Pontifex and working under her own influence?\nHowever, getting the Moon Goddess Temple to believe she was the Moon Goddess wouldn’t be a walk in the park. Even though she had Sylvana’s power, her beast form was still that of a tiger. Only when she fully matured and absorbed all of Sylvana’s power would her beast form start to change into Sylvana’s.\nBut time wasn’t on her side. By the time her beast form transformed into Sylvana’s, Scion might already be beyond saving.\n\"Is there a way to change my beast form into Sylvana’s sooner?\" Arix asked Sylvana in her thoughts.\n\"There is. If I merge with you, we can temporarily take on Sylvana’s beast form,\" Sylvana responded with calm assurance.\n\"Perfect! Sylvana, I might need your help soon. I hope it’s not too much trouble,\" Arix said, her smile brightening with newfound hope.\n\"As long as it’s what you need, I’m here to help,\" Sylvana replied in a gentle, reassuring tone.\n\"Thank you, Sylvana,\" Arix murmured, feeling a wave of gratitude that almost brought tears to her eyes.\nShe realized just how fortunate she was. No matter how tough things got, she never had to face them alone—there was always someone ready to stand by her.\nTaking a deep breath to steady the emotions swelling within her, Arix lifted her head and looked seriously at her two companions. \"I think I’ve found a way,\" she announced.",

      "content": "Chapter 237: The Moon Goddess\nAfter hearing Arix’s plan, Cassian and Drexel exchanged a look.\nBoth of them thought that Arix’s idea might be a bit too bold. The idea of pretending to be the Moon Goddess was something most people wouldn’t even dare to think of.\nThey were worried that if the Moon Goddess Temple found out the truth, they’d definitely be in big trouble, likely facing a relentless chase to the ends of the universe.\nIn the end, Drexel carefully suggested, \"Arix, maybe we should come up with a safer plan. The Moon Goddess Temple probably has ways to tell the real Moon Goddess from a fake one. If they find out, we won’t even make it out of the temple.\"\nJust thinking about what could happen if they got caught made Drexel’s legs start to tremble. He hadn’t even gotten married or had a career yet—he wasn’t ready to die young!\nSeeing Drexel’s pitiful expression, Arix rolled her eyes and said, \"Don’t worry, there’s no way we’ll get caught.\" After all, she was the real deal.\nDrexel was speechless. He wondered where Arix got all this confidence from.\nSeeing that he couldn’t change Arix’s mind, Drexel turned his gaze to Cassian, hoping that Arix’s fiance could stop her. But Cassian, after his initial surprise, just smiled at Arix.\n\"Arix, do whatever you want. I’ve got your back,\" Cassian said, looking at the young woman with a mix of affection and deep emotion.\nDrexel’s face immediately went blank. He realized he had made a mistake by relying on someone so lovestruck.\n\"Thank you, Cassian,\" Arix said with a bright smile. Then the three of them started putting their plan into action.\nFirst, Cassian carried Arix, who had transformed into Sylvana, and deliberately appeared near a well-known paparazzo. After letting the paparazzo take a few blurry photos with his poor stalking skills, Cassian and Arix quickly disappeared from sight, hiding their success.\n\"Will this really work? What if the people from the Moon Goddess Temple don’t check the interstellarnet?\" Drexel, who was waiting nearby like a scared puppy, fretted.\n\"Don’t worry, even if they don’t see it, I’ll make sure they do,\" Arix said confidently, raising her head, which now had two small horns.\nCassian, clearly charmed, affectionately patted Arix’s soft, fluffy head, his smile showing just how happy he was.\n\"Alright, as long as there are no problems,\" Drexel said, not pressing for details since he knew his sister wouldn’t tell him anyway.\nAs expected, the paparazzo immediately uploaded the photos to the interstellarnet. At first, the people of the Empire were captivated by Cassian’s stunning looks. Only a few noticed the figure Arix, whom Cassian was holding in the center of the shot.\n- \"BirdsOfAFeather\": \"Huh, what breed is this pet? I’ve never seen one like it before.\"\n- \"LightsOutMonk\": \"Doesn’t matter what it is, it’s so cute! I want one too!\"\n- \"MysteryInTheTrunks\": \"Wait, doesn’t this pet kind of look like our Moon Goddess...?\"\nThe commenter sounded hesitant, but their words made the chat go silent for a moment.\nThen, an interstellarnet historian pulled up a photo of Arix and compared it with an image of the Moon Goddess. The 100% similarity instantly caused a huge uproar across the Empire’s interstellarnet.\n- \"FlatAsAField\": \"OMG, OMG, OMG, I actually saw the Moon Goddess! Am I dreaming, folks?\"\n- \"SchoolIsGoneSunIsBright\": \"Whether we’re dreaming or not, why is the Moon Goddess with the royal family? Shouldn’t she be in the Moon Goddess Temple receiving worship?\"\n- \"GirlsRuleOrGetDitched\": \"Good point! I asked my cousin, who’s a follower at the Moon Goddess Temple, and they don’t know anything about this. Is the royal family trying to keep the Moon Goddess for themselves?\"\nNews that the royal family had found the Moon Goddess spread like wildfire throughout the Empire. The entire nation was buzzing about it.\nThe Moon Goddess Temple got wind of the news too. Though they were initially skeptical, their doubt quickly turned into joy, and they rushed to the palace in a flurry of excitement.\n...\nIn the lush gardens of the royal palace, Cassian cradled Arix in his arms, a troubled expression on his face.\n\"There must be some mistake,\" he insisted, with an innocent face. \"This is just a pet. How could it possibly be the Moon Goddess you’re searching for?\"\nThree priests from the Moon Goddess Temple had arrived at the palace, led by Vezgor, who maintained a calm demeanor. However, the other two couldn’t take their eyes off Arix from the moment they laid eyes on her.\nArix was now a stunning mix of tiger, white deer, and white wolf, complete with a pair of wings.\nTo the priests, there was no doubt—this creature was their Moon Goddess.\nAfter a brief, knowing glance between them, the two priests began urging Cassian to hand over Arix so they could return her to the temple. But Cassian stubbornly maintained that they were mistaken. Finally, after much hesitation and a show of reluctance, he handed Arix over to Vezgor.\n\"No matter if Snowy is the Moon Goddess or not, she’s my friend. Please treat her well,\" Cassian said, putting on a convincing display of heartbreak.\n\"Rest assured, Prince Cassian,\" one of the priests replied. \"The Moon Goddess Temple has ways to verify her identity. If she isn’t the Moon Goddess, we will return her to you, unharmed.\"\n\"That’s a relief,\" Cassian responded, waving them off as if overcome with sadness. \"You may go now.\"\nHaving accomplished their mission, the priests didn’t linger. They bid Cassian farewell and prepared to take Arix back to the Moon Goddess Temple.\nJust before leaving, Vezgor shot Cassian a meaningful look. Cassian, unfazed, watched them depart. Once they were out of sight, he muttered under his breath, \"The rest is up to you.\"\n...\nArix kicked off her mission with a clear goal in mind.\nThe plan? Spread some carefully crafted fake news to fool the Moon Goddess Temple into thinking the royal family had truly found the Moon Goddess.\nWhen the temple came to retrieve Arix, she’d have her chance to figure out how to push Scion and her grandfather out of the temple for good.\nTo pull this off, Arix had to fully embrace the role of a haughty, commanding Moon Goddess. Anytime a priest displeased her, she’d lunge at them with her claws. But just before making contact, Arix would pause, softening her strike to merely rip a few threads from their clothes.\nBy the time they made it back to the Moon Goddess Temple, only Vezgor’s outfit had minor tears, while the robes of the other two priests were practically in shreds.\nStrangely, the priests didn’t seem to mind at all. Instead, they fretted that their garments might’ve hurt Arix’s claws, grinning and falling over themselves to please her.\nArix, fed up with their groveling, turned away, choosing to ignore them.\nVezgor watched all this unfold with a slight smile tugging at his lips.\nTheir destination was the grand hall of the Moon Goddess Temple. Word had already spread, and the hall was packed, including almost all twelve Cardinals—a rare sight.\nAs Vezgor and his group entered, every eye in the room locked onto him. No, not him—onto the small creature cradled in his arms.\nThere was no mistaking it—this was their Moon Goddess!\nSeeing this, excitement flared in the eyes of every priest.",

      "content": "Chapter 238: The Twelve Cardinals\nWhen Vezgor reached the front, the twelve Cardinals led all the followers in a deep, solemn bow, greeting Arix with a reverent, \"Greetings to the Moon Goddess!\"\nIn response to their overwhelming respect, Arix gave a small nod, lifting her chin again to stare down at them, her gaze cold and dismissive, as if they were nothing more than her servants.\nBut not every Cardinal was as awestruck as they appeared. Ignathor, one of the Cardinals, spoke up with a concerned tone, \"Your Holiness, now that the Moon Goddess has returned, we should conduct a test right away. It would be disastrous if we were wrong.\"\nThough some priests bristled at Ignathor’s bluntness toward their supposed Moon Goddess, they couldn’t deny the importance of his words. A silent agreement passed through them as they exchanged glances.\nVezgor didn’t argue. He simply replied with a frosty, \"Alright,\" before carrying Arix to the Moon Goddess Hall.\nThe hall was reminiscent of the Holy Temple of the Tiger Clan, with a statue of Sylvana standing tall inside.\nAs Arix scanned the familiar surroundings, she quickly grasped how the test would play out.\n\"Sylvana, is this test going to be okay?\" Arix asked nervously in her mind.\n\"Don’t worry, Arix. You’ve got this,\" Sylvana, currently inhabiting Arix’s body, reassured her swiftly.\n\"Alright.\" With Sylvana’s words, Arix felt a wave of relief. She confidently stepped out of Vezgor’s arms, standing tall on the testing platform, ready for what was to come.\nAs the crowd watched with bated breath, a golden energy streamed from the forehead of Sylvana’s statue, spiraling around Arix. It took a drop of her heart’s blood, then retreated back to the statue.\n\"To witness the Moon Goddess’s test in this lifetime... I can die without regret,\" an elderly priest murmured, clutching his chest with emotion.\n\"The statue’s reaction proves it—it must be her,\" another priest exclaimed, barely containing his excitement.\n\"Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. What if it isn’t?\" Ignathor cut in, throwing a wet blanket on their enthusiasm.\n\"Ignathor, that’s out of line. Anyone would think you don’t want the Moon Goddess to return,\" a young priest snapped, glaring daggers at him.\n\"Yeah, ever since this started, you’ve been nothing but critical,\" his companion added, hostility in his voice.\nDespite his doubts, Ignathor didn’t dare disrespect the Moon Goddess. But the accusations riled him, and he glared coldly at the young priests, just about to fire back when the Pontifex intervened.\n\"One more word, and you’re all out,\" Vezgor warned, his expression dark and stern.\nThe priests fell silent immediately, not daring to push further. Even Ignathor had to swallow his frustration, letting out an irritated huff.\nAs the tension settled, the light from the statue’s forehead flared again.\nA brilliant golden glow filled the entire Moon Goddess Hall, leaving all the priests and followers awestruck, their eyes wide with wonder at the breathtaking sight before them.\nArix had initially expected the test to be a low-key affair, something similar to what she’d seen at the Holy Temple of the Tiger Clan, where the statue’s forehead would simply glow. But she was in for a surprise. After the Sylvana statue glowed, the whole thing suddenly lit up like the sun.\nA beam of light shot straight up from the statue, piercing the sky and shaking the Empire’s capital to its core.\nThe massive display in the sky attracted the whole city’s attention. All over the capital, therian citizens turned their eyes toward the brilliant light, their faces a mix of awe and confusion.\n\"What is that? It’s huge, so bright, so dazzling!\"\n\"Is someone becoming a god?\"\n\"It’s coming from the Moon Goddess Temple! Maybe those rumors on the interstellarnet were true?\"\n\"Of course! How could we forget the Moon Goddess? I’ve got to get over there and see this for myself.\"\nAs the therians connected the dots, realization hit them like a wave, and many of them rushed toward the temple, desperate to witness the return of their Moon Goddess in person.\nInside the Moon Goddess Hall, Arix stood there, just as stunned as everyone else, staring up at the beam of light. Sure, she’d been planning to make a splash to justify kicking her grandfather and Scion out of the temple, but this was way beyond what she’d imagined.\nAs she glanced at the massive hole in the roof caused by the beam, Arix nervously rubbed her nose.\n’The temple looks pretty luxurious—I’m so lucky, they won’t make me pay for the damage... wait, will they?’\nMeanwhile, the priests were too lost in awe to consider what Arix might be thinking. The extraordinary sight before them left them spellbound. When they finally snapped out of it, they stared at the little cub on the platform with wide, sparkling eyes.\nThe idea that she might not be the Moon Goddess evaporated completely.\nOverflowing with excitement, all the priests and followers dropped to one knee in reverence, their voices booming as they proclaimed, \"Welcome back, Moon Goddess!\"\nThe sudden chorus jolted Arix out of her thoughts. Caught off guard for a moment, she quickly collected herself. She slipped back into her role as the arrogant and haughty Moon Goddess, gazing down at them from her elevated position.\nOnce she felt the timing was right, she spoke up, her voice carrying authority, \"Since my identity has been confirmed, I have three demands. Can you fulfill them?\"\n\"Please, Moon Goddess, state your demands. We will meet them all, be it one or a thousand,\" The priest who had brought Arix back was the first to respond, smiling up at her with eagerness.\nThe other priests quickly nodded in agreement. After all, the entire purpose of the Moon Goddess Temple was to serve the Moon Goddess herself.\nArix was taken aback by how easily her identity was working in her favor. After a brief moment of surprise, a satisfied smile spread across her face. \"Very well. My first demand is to replace the Pontifex.\"\nHer words hung in the air, and the entire hall fell into a stunned silence.\nThe hall was thick with tension as Arix’s demand hung in the air.\nPriests exchanged uneasy glances, unsure whether to comply with what seemed like an audacious request from their newly returned Moon Goddess.\nSome priests nervously swallowed, sneaking glances at Vezgor, who stood calmly at the front. They couldn’t fathom what the Pontifex had done to offend the Moon Goddess so deeply that her first action was to strip him of his position.\nDespite the mixture of pity and sly satisfaction that some directed his way, Vezgor remained composed. His face was unreadable, as if the prospect of losing his title didn’t faze him in the slightest.\nArix, noticing the uncertainty in their eyes, began to realize that maybe her demand had been a bit too abrupt. But with limited time in the Empire, she felt the need to act swiftly, even if it meant ruffling a few feathers.\nWhile Arix was guessing at the thoughts swirling in the other priests’ minds, Ignathor could barely contain his excitement. He stepped forward eagerly, his voice loud and supportive as he backed her decision. \"The current Pontifex has clearly displeased the Moon Goddess. It’s only right to replace him. I, Ignathor from the Dragon clan, fully support the Moon Goddess!\"\nWith Ignathor taking the lead, the other priests exchanged knowing looks. Though none openly voiced their agreement, they all subtly lowered their heads in acceptance.\nThey understood the hierarchy here—between the Pontifex and the Moon Goddess, the latter’s will reigned supreme.\nMeanwhile, Vezgor remained unruffled. With a calm and deliberate motion, he began removing his Pontifex robes, eventually handing them over to a nearby priest.\n\"Your Holiness...\" the priest whispered, unsure as he took the robes, a deep sense of injustice gnawing at him on Vezgor’s behalf. He couldn’t comprehend why the Moon Goddess would single out the Pontifex in this way.\nBut Vezgor simply shook his head, a silent command to the priest not to act impulsively.\nThen, with a respectful bow to Arix, he turned and left the Moon Goddess Hall, now dressed only in his simple white undergarments. His steps were steady and composed, showing no hint of regret as he departed.\nEveryone in the hall watched him leave, their emotions a mix of confusion, respect, and discomfort—everyone except Ignathor, who was practically beaming.\nArix, too, silently watched her grandfather until he was out of sight. Once he was gone, she turned back to the priests. \"Thank you for fulfilling my first request. Now, my second request is for everyone to recommend a new Pontifex.\"\nHer words broke the silence, and the priests shifted uneasily once more. This demand was less shocking than the first, but it still carried weight. They exchanged glances, each silently weighing their options, knowing that whoever they chose would have to walk a fine line under the watchful eye of the Moon Goddess herself.",

      "content": "Chapter 239: Fake Oracle\nThe first request left everyone stunned, but the second sparked excitement throughout the Moon Goddess Temple. Almost everyone in the Empire, especially those within these sacred walls, dreamed of becoming the Pontifex.\n\"I’ve served the Moon Goddess Temple for ten years. What do you think of me?\" Ignathor confidently stepped forward, sure that the role of Pontifex was already his.\nArix didn’t show any reaction. She simply smiled, keeping her thoughts to herself. This silence spurred the other eleven priests to start recommending themselves, each eager to take the position.\nOne priest, however, hesitated and then spoke up, \"But wasn’t it already decided that Scion would be the next Pontifex?\"\nThis was exactly what Arix had been waiting for. She quickly feigned surprise and asked, \"Who is Scion?\"\nAt the mention of the name, a hush fell over the group.\nThe priests exchanged nervous glances, unsure of what to say.\nFinally, Ignathor, eager to gain Arix’s favor, broke the silence. \"Scion is the priest you personally chose as the next Pontifex. We received your divine decree at his birth.\"\n\"Hmph, I issued no such decree, nor do I know which wandering spirit dared to impersonate me,\" Arix retorted, faking outrage. \"This imposter, Scion, must be expelled from the Moon Goddess Temple immediately.\"\nTo make her anger more convincing, Arix let her psychic power flare up, making it seem as though she was genuinely furious. The intense pressure made everyone around her feel like helpless prey, frozen in fear. No one even thought to resist.\n\"Please forgive us, Your Holiness. We will drive Scion out at once,\" Ignathor stammered, terrified yet eager to prove his loyalty.\nArix nodded approvingly, even offering Ignathor a small smile. This gesture from the temple’s deity sent Ignathor’s pride soaring. Feeling smug, he threw a triumphant look at the others before turning to leave with his head held high.\n\"Wait.\"\nArix’s voice stopped Ignathor in his tracks just as he reached the door. Confused, he turned back and bowed, \"Your Holiness, is there anything else you require?\"\nWith a mysterious smile, Arix replied, \"Just to be safe, let’s go together.\"\n\"Of course... as you wish,\" Ignathor agreed, though he was clearly puzzled. He didn’t dare question her. The other priests and followers exchanged looks, sensing something was about to unfold, and then slowly followed along.\nWhen the group reached the courtyard where Scion resided, they were immediately struck by the sight of a young man who looked almost otherworldly.\nClad in a pure white robe, Scion seemed to radiate an ethereal purity.\nHis face, untouched by any blemish, was as striking as that of a divine being, leaving those who saw him momentarily entranced.\nIgnathor, however, snapped out of it quickly, his ambition blinding him to Scion’s attactiveness. \"You, let me make this clear. The Moon Goddess Temple has uncovered your deceit. You are not the next Pontifex. Now, be wise and leave the temple immediately.\"\nThe others, who had been spellbound by Scion’s appearance, were jolted back to reality by Ignathor’s harsh words.\nThey quickly shot disapproving looks at Ignathor. He had a knack for ruining perfectly serene moments with his harsh words, and today was no different.\nBut Arix, surprisingly, found herself somewhat impressed by Ignathor’s actions. Everything he did today seemed to align perfectly with her own wishes. If it weren’t for the fact that he was her grandfather’s sworn enemy, she might have even liked having such a subordinate.\nA small sigh of regret escaped her as she shook her head and turned her gaze back to Scion, curious about his response.\nAll eyes were now on Scion, yet he remained calm, seated on a stone chair as if completely indifferent to the crowd around him. It wasn’t until Ignathor’s cutting words reached his ears that he finally reacted, though only slightly.\n\"Are you sure?\" Scion asked, his voice carrying a trace of confusion.\n\"Absolutely! Do yourself a favor and leave now. This way you can at least save yourself some dignity,\" Ignathor sneered, full of disdain.\n\"Fine,\" Scion replied with a quiet acceptance. He had been coerced into coming to the Moon Goddess Temple in the first place and had no real desire to stay. Rising from his seat, he gracefully avoided the crowd and began making his way toward the temple’s gate.\nHis departure was like a work of art, filled with an ethereal grace that seemed almost otherworldly. But to Ignathor, it looked like the pathetic retreat of a defeated man, which only fueled his sense of pride.\nAnd why wouldn’t he feel proud? With most of the significant members of the Tiger clan leaving the Moon Goddess Temple today, the meaning was clear.\nSoon, this temple would be Ignathor’s domain.\nThe thought filled him with ambition, his eyes gleaming with the possibilities. The only step left was securing the position of Pontifex. Once that was done, he would be the second most powerful figure in the Moon Goddess Temple, just beneath the Moon Goddess herself.\nIgnathor was lost in a blissful dream about his future when a voice from \"the Moon Goddess\" shattered it.\n\"Cardinal Ignathor, I’m sorry, but you’re not fit to serve here anymore. You need to leave,\" Arix stated, her tone icy.\nThe joy in Ignathor’s heart vanished, replaced by a cold dread that felt like it was freezing him from the inside out.\n\"This has to be a mistake, right? I’ve been nothing but loyal. How could the temple not want me?\" Ignathor stammered, unable to grasp the reality of what was happening.\nHe was on the brink of becoming Pontifex.\n’How can this be real?’\n\"Priest Ignathor, you heard me correctly. While your loyalty is undeniable, have you forgotten the wrongs you’ve committed?\" Arix’s gaze was as cold as her words, cutting through his feeble defenses.\nBefore confronting Ignathor, Arix had made sure to dig into his past with the help of Cassian. The report she received confirmed her suspicions—there was more than enough evidence.\nAround them, the other priests exchanged glances, their eyebrows raised in surprise. Then they quietly returned to their tasks.\nThose who held grudges against Ignathor leaned in, eager to witness his downfall.\nIgnathor’s eyes widened in fear. He realized that the Moon Goddess Temple knew everything. Of course, how could he have thought the goddess herself wouldn’t be aware?\nAccepting his fate, Ignathor fell to his knees, tears streaming down his face. He begged, \"Moon Goddess, I’ve sinned! Please, don’t cast me out. I know I was wrong. Just give me one more chance—just one more.\"\nHe bowed low, his desperation evident.\nSome of the priests who had been close to Ignathor began to feel pity for him. They were about to speak up when Arix’s voice cut through the tension.\n\"Ignathor, when you were bullying your peers, snuffing out the talents within the temple, and covering up your family’s sins, did you ever consider justice would come? Do you think someone like you—who should guide others and serve the gods—deserves to be a Cardinal?\" Arix’s words were sharp, leaving no room for mercy.\nAmong the crowd were those who had suffered under Ignathor’s rule, their talents crushed by his cruelty. Hearing Arix’s words, their eyes welled up with tears, but not of sadness—of relief.\nThese were people who had endured in silence, knowing that fighting back could mean expulsion or worse, disappearing entirely. They had clung to life, hoping that one day Ignathor would face justice.\nAnd now, here he was, at the mercy of the very goddess he had served.",

      "content": "Chapter 240: Ignathor’s Fury\nThose who had been wronged felt a deep sense of satisfaction. Even the priests who had thought to defend Ignathor sighed and closed their eyes, realizing there was no point in intervening.\nWords from others could be questioned, but when the message came straight from the Moon Goddess, there was no doubt. Showing any leniency to someone like Ignathor, who had tainted the temple’s honor, was already an act of grace.\nIgnathor knew that all hope was lost. He clung to the ground, pressing his forehead harder, fingers digging into the stone until they bled.\nThen, as if something snapped inside him, he began to laugh—a sound so twisted and cold it made everyone around him shiver.\nLifting his head abruptly, he fixed a fierce glare on Arix and snarled, \"I’m no sinner! I did nothing wrong! People have to look out for themselves, or they’re doomed. You’re in no position to judge me for that!\"\nArix didn’t flinch. She met his wild eyes with a calm, steady gaze. \"You’re right; you weren’t completely wrong,\" she said.\nIgnathor froze, caught off guard.\n’Why is she agreeing with me?’\nThe priests and followers nearby, who had just been indifferent, now looked at Arix with confusion and disapproval. They knew the darkness in Ignathor’s past, and no one wanted someone like him to stay in the Moon Goddess Temple.\nArix ignored their reactions, her voice as cold as ever. \"But that only applies to ordinary people. If you were just another person, your actions might be chalked up to a flawed character. But you are—or rather, were—a Cardinal of the Moon Goddess Temple. As a Cardinal, you didn’t just fail to do your duty; you became a blight on this world. Sparing your life instead of executing you to cleanse the temple is already more mercy than you deserve.\"\nThe other priests started to speak up, their voices urging him to leave. \"Yes, Ignathor, the Moon Goddess has already shown mercy. It’s time for you to go.\"\nBut Ignathor only laughed, a bitter, hollow sound. \"Ha! I’ve served as a priest for over ten years, and never once has the Moon Goddess rebuked me. But now, as soon as you show up, you want to kick me out? I see how it is. You can’t be the Moon Goddess. If you were, you wouldn’t be driving me out!\"\nHis eyes turned bloodshot, and a murderous aura began to seep from him.\nSuddenly, a violent surge of psychic power erupted, crackling in the air around him. With a swift motion of his hand, shadowy figures emerged from the corners of the room, and with pure rage, he launched himself at Arix.\nThe priests gasped in shock, unable to process the scene unfolding before them. Terror gripped them as they realized the Moon Goddess Temple was under threat.\n\"Ignathor, stop! Have you lost your mind? This is the Moon Goddess Temple!\"\n\"If you harm the temple, your clan will be branded as traitors to the Empire!\"\n\"Even if you don’t care about your own life, think of your family! If you destroy the Moon Goddess Temple, your clan will be cursed for eternity!\"\nIn a desperate frenzy, the priests rushed to protect Arix, shouting warnings at Ignathor as they tried to stop the madness he had unleashed.\nIn that moment, Ignathor had completely lost it. The noise around him was just a blur as his focus zeroed in on one thing: killing Arix.\n\"We can’t him! He has totally lost his mind!\"\n\"Stop trying. It’s pointless. Can’t you see? Ignathor’s lost his mind.\"\nThe priests, realizing their words were falling on deaf ears, gave up trying to reason with him. They quickly redirected their psychic power to fend off the relentless attacks from the death guards.\nAmidst the chaos, Arix stood at the center, calm and composed. She had seen this coming a mile away.\nIgnathor wasn’t the first person she had encountered who snapped like this. People like him had a pattern—they’d play innocent at first, but when that failed, they’d lash out wildly. Arix knew from experience that such people were dangerous if not kept at arm’s length.\nAs thoughts of her grandfather’s suffering surfaced, Arix’s gaze hardened. A wave of psychic power surged from her, binding everyone in the room.\nUnder the astonished stares of those around her, Arix coolly directed her power, forming a fist in the air.\nIgnathor, who had been raging just seconds before, suddenly looked like he was being choked, gasping for air.\nArix hesitated for a split second, then closed her eyes and tightened her psychic grip.\nIgnathor’s struggles ceased. His body stiffened, his head fell back, and he took his final breath.\nWith Ignathor’s death, the battle ended.\nThe black-clad death guards vanished from the Moon Goddess Temple the moment he died. The priests, left in stunned silence, didn’t dare move even though Arix’s power no longer held them.\nThe room was thick with tension. No one spoke or made a sound, each person afraid they might meet the same fate as Ignathor.\nBut behind the calm facade, Arix was struggling to keep her hands from trembling. She had just taken a life—a real, breathing person. Inside, she was shaken, but she kept her expression unreadable, as if what had just happened was nothing more than a minor inconvenience.\nThe silence became almost unbearable. The priests exchanged nervous glances, each too scared to break the quiet.\nFinally, one old priest, chosen by the others with reluctance, stepped forward.\nThe poor old man, shaking with fear, carefully asked, \"Moon Goddess, what should we do with Ignathor’s body?\"\n\"Let his family take care of it. And you did well. Tomorrow, you’ll be appointed as the Pontifex. That’s my third request,\" Arix responded, her words leaving everyone stunned.\nThe priest who had stepped forward: \"Wait, what?\"\n’Can you really just pick a Pontifex like that?’\nThe other priests stared in disbelief. They had thought the old priest was being rewarded simply for speaking up.\nRegret washed over them as they realized they had missed an opportunity. If only they had been the one to step forward, maybe they’d be the new Pontifex instead.\nDespite the mixed reactions, the old priest, after a moment of shock, lit up with joy as if he had just won the lottery. \"Thank you, Moon Goddess, for your trust. I will do my utmost to fulfill the duties of the Pontifex.\"\nArix gave a small nod and asked one of the priests to show her to a room where she could rest.\nBefore leaving, Arix paused and then spoke with a tone that hinted at her hesitation. \"If anyone asks, just say that Ignathor sacrificed himself to protect me.\"\nThe priests and followers, who had been anxiously debating how to handle the Dragon clan after Ignathor’s rebellion, were left speechless.\nAs they stared at Arix in disbelief, a deep sense of admiration grew inside them.\nTheir leader was not only powerful but incredibly kind.\nGiven Ignathor’s actions, he would have faced severe punishment, and the entire Dragon clan might have suffered as a result. After all, an attack on the leader of the Moon Goddess Temple by a member of their clan could have easily led to their downfall.\nBut from Arix’s words, it was clear that she intended to place the blame solely on Ignathor, sparing the rest of his clan. Even in death, she ensured his name remained untarnished.\nSuch a compassionate and strong leader—how could anyone not be moved by her?\nThe next day, Arix witnessed the formal appointment of the old priest as the new Pontifex.\nOne of his first acts was to abolish the rule that had long forbidden priests of the Moon Goddess Temple from marrying. Only then did Arix feel at ease about leaving the temple.\nBefore she left, however, she called the old priest for a private conversation.\n\"Is there something you need, Moon Goddess?\" Despite his new title, the old priest still felt a twinge of nervousness in Arix’s presence. After all, he had seen her coldly take the life of a fellow Cardinal he had known for nearly a decade. The memory wasn’t overly traumatic, but it still left him feeling uneasy whenever he was around her.\nArix noticed the old priest trembling like a frightened bird and began to wonder if she had made the wrong choice in appointing him.\nAlthough she didn’t have any particular attachment to the Moon Goddess Temple, she didn’t want to see it come to harm. But the decision had been made, and she would simply have to monitor the situation.\nWith a sigh, Arix rubbed her temples, trying to push aside her doubts. She finally spoke, cutting through the old priest’s growing anxiety. \"I’m going to be away for a while. If any issues come up, contact this person. I’ll return when I get the message.\"\nAs she spoke, Arix tossed a small communication device to the old priest, which contained her contact information.\nThe old priest, despite his reservations about Arix leaving, didn’t dare voice them. Reluctantly, he opened the device and saw Arix’s name and picture.\nThe priest recognized the girl.\n’Isn’t she the granddaughter of the previous Pontifex? And isn’t she supposed to be the crown princess of the Empire? How does she end up connected to the Moon Goddess?’\n\"Moon Goddess, may I ask why are you giving me this girl’s contact information?\" The old priest couldn’t help asking, his nerves making way for curiosity.\n\"Ahem, she’s a friend of mine. If she ever needs anything, make sure to help her out,\" Arix replied, turning her head away and coughing slightly, as if the topic made her uncomfortable.\n\"Oh, I see. Understood, Moon Goddess. Don’t worry; we’ll take good care of your friend,\" the old priest said, straightening up with a sense of pride as he made his promise.\n\"Good, very well then. Goodbye.\" Arix said, and in the blink of an eye, she vanished from the temple hall.\nThe old priest stood frozen, caught off guard by her sudden departure. He stared at the empty space where she had been, a mix of shock and frustration on his face.\nIt was only after he glanced at the communication device in his hand, with Arix’s contact information displayed, that he finally began to relax, letting out a small sigh of relief.",

      "content": "Chapter 241: Father And Daughter\nArix, hide in her invisibility combat suit, moved like a shadow past the guards stationed at the Moon Goddess Temple. Her mind raced with thoughts of which wall to scale for a quick getaway when a familiar voice broke through the silence.\n\"Arix, it’s clear around here. You can fly out,\" Cassian’s voice floated over from the other side of the wall. He sounded brimming with excitement, as he knew they were moments away from seeing each other.\n’Wait, how did Cassian know I was here?’\nFor a split second, Arix was puzzled. Then it hit her—the necklace around her neck was more than just a gift; it tracked her location.\nWith that realization, she didn’t dwell on it any longer. Instead, she responded with a rush of adrenaline, flying up to the wall’s edge and landing softly into Cassian’s waiting arms.\n\"Arix, you finally made it out,\" Cassian said, his voice warm and filled with the longing that had been building up.\n\"Sorry for keeping you waiting,\" Arix replied, meeting his gaze with equally deep emotions.\n\"These past two days must’ve been rough on you. Look, you’ve even lost weight,\" Cassian murmured, his fingers gently brushing through the soft fur of the cute creature he now held.\nArix glanced at her still-round form and felt a bit amused. She hadn’t lost any weight, but that didn’t stop her from snuggling into Cassian’s touch. She playfully protested, \"It wasn’t hard at all. You’re the one who’s had it tough, waiting for me.\"\nMeanwhile, Drexel, leaning against the wall nearby, was on the brink of rolling his eyes at the couple’s lovestruck banter. He had endured enough.\nAfter a few more moments of watching them fawn over each other, Drexel finally cut in, his patience wearing thin. \"Alright, that’s enough. Mom and Dad are still waiting for us back home. If we don’t head back soon, our excuse isn’t going to hold.\"\nArix had been missing for two days. Drexel had covered for her, saying that Alpha Leonidas and Luna Amethyst wanted Arix to stay a bit longer. This had kept Thaddeus and Fleur from worrying.\nBut now, with the couple leaving the palace for their trip, Arix’s reason for staying at the palace was quickly wearing thin. If Arix didn’t go back now, she would have some serious explaining to do.\nThe thought of getting caught brought Arix and Cassian back to reality, and they reluctantly eased off their affectionate display.\nArix swiftly shifted back to her human form and, with Cassian’s hand firmly in hers, they made their way home, content.\nAs for Drexel, the unfortunate third wheel, he once again found himself enduring their endless public displays of affection.\nWhen they arrived back at the Tiger clan, Arix noticed right away that the place was buzzing with activity. Everyone seemed to be in high spirits.\n\"Did something happen while I was away?\" Arix finally asked, her curiosity piqued as she spotted several clan members who typically resided on other planets.\nUsually, those who lived off-world only returned for the annual bloodline test. They rarely came back otherwise.\n\"What else? Grandpa’s returned, so the clan’s throwing a big welcome banquet,\" Drexel had been around the clan for the past couple of days, so he filled her in.\n\"Oh, that explains it,\" Arix nodded, the pieces falling into place.\nTheir grandpa had been the Pontifex for decades, serving as a guardian of the Tiger clan. After all his years of sacrifice and dedication, it was only right to throw a grand celebration now that he had come back home.\nDrexel nodded in agreement, but then something seemed to click in his mind. He turned toward Cassian, a bit puzzled. \"So, we’re back home now... Why aren’t you heading out?\"\nDrexel had expected Cassian to take off after dropping them off, but it was clear Cassian had other plans.\nCassian’s posture stiffened, and his eyelashes fluttered with a nervous hesitation. He had intended to leave, but the thought of Scion still lurking around made him uneasy. He couldn’t bring himself to go back just yet.\nNoticing Cassian’s sudden quietness and the way his gaze dropped, Arix quickly jumped in to reassure him. \"It’s probably better if you stay with us. Your parents are out enjoying themselves, and you’d just be alone at the palace. Why not join us at the banquet instead?\"\nCassian’s eyes lit up, filled with gratitude. \"Yeah, that sounds good. Thanks, Arix,\" he said, genuinely moved by her thoughtfulness.\nArix, completely smitten by Cassian’s charm, replied with a warm smile, \"No, thank YOU for staying with me.\"\nDrexel, meanwhile, could only stare at the two of them, utterly exasperated.\n’Here we go again. All I did was ask a simple question, and now I’m stuck in another round of their lovey-dovey nonsense.’\nWith a shake of his head, Drexel decided to cut his losses. He ignored their affection-fest and made a beeline for the main hall, his frustration clear in his every step.\nThe atmosphere inside the main hall stood in stark contrast to the lively energy outside.\nThe room was heavy with an unsettling silence. Every member of the Tiger clan seemed on edge, their attention subtly fixed on two key figures: Vezgor, the former Pontifex, and Fleur, Arix’s mother.\nNormally, one would expect a close bond between Vezgor and Fleur, given that they were father and daughter. But since their arrival, they had been acting as if the other didn’t even exist.\nThe tension between them was palpable, and it hung over the room like a storm cloud, making everyone hesitant to speak freely.\nNo one wanted to say the wrong thing and risk upsetting the delicate situation.\n...\nKrylak, the tribe’s leader, was at a loss.\nHe wanted nothing more than to see everyone getting along, especially between Vezgor and Fleur, but no matter how many times he tried to start a conversation, the tension in the room only deepened.\nSometimes, when you haven’t walked in someone else’s shoes, offering advice can do more harm than good.\nWith a heavy sigh, Krylak decided to let things unfold naturally, shaking his head as he opted to stay silent.\nFleur, far from a child, could see the efforts being made to mend the rift, but she knew too well that some wounds couldn’t be healed with a few well-meaning words.\nVezgor had been missing from her life for as long as she could remember.\nHis absence left a void filled by the cruel whispers of others: \"Your father doesn’t want you,\" \"You’re just a child nobody cares about,\" and \"He must have had a reason for abandoning you.\"\nThese repeated taunts wounded Fleur deeply. At first, she’d argued back, then fought back with her fists. Later, she grew quiet, and finally, she began to believe them.\nHer mother eventually stepped in, showering Fleur with love and confronting anyone who dared to hurt her. But the scars from those early years had already formed, leaving marks on Fleur’s heart that were hard to erase.\nAs a child, Fleur had both hated and missed Vezgor. But in the end, she found that forgetting was the only way to dull the pain.\nVezgor was well aware of Fleur’s resentment. He knew that the damage had been done, and nothing he could say would make it right. All he wanted, in whatever time he had left, was to make amends with the daughter he had failed.\nNow he just wondered if there was really enough time left.\nAs he considered his own limited days, Vezgor began to think that maybe this distance was for the best. When he was gone, maybe it would hurt less if she remained indifferent.\nSo, they remained locked in this awkward standoff—Fleur, too proud to reach out, and Vezgor, too weighed down by guilt to break the silence.\nIt was into this heavy atmosphere that Drexel walked, immediately sensing the tension in the room.\nHe spotted two empty seats between his mother and his grandfather, assuming they were meant for him and Arix. Confidently, he made his way over, but just as he was about to sit down, Fleur caught him by the arm and pushed him toward Vezgor.",

      "content": "Chapter 242: An Awkward Reunion\n\"Mom, what’s going on?\" Drexel asked, completely bewildered by her actions.\nFleur didn’t bother with an explanation. Instead, she flashed a bright smile and turned toward the door. \"Arix, Cassian, come sit here. I saved these seats for you.\"\nDrexel was certain his mother had no clue that Cassian would be coming, so those seats had clearly been intended for him!\n’It’s one thing when Arix was around, but why does Cassian’s presence always push me to the sidelines?’\nSeething inside, Drexel could only roll his eyes in frustration as he took a seat next to his father, Thaddeus.\nThaddeus, ever the attentive father, noticed his son being sidelined once again and offered a comforting pat on the shoulder.\nThe small gesture lifted Drexel’s spirits, but only for a moment. That brief sense of comfort evaporated when Thaddeus turned his attention fully to Cassian, showering him with care.\n\"Cassian, how is Arix doing in the Empire recently? Did she get you any trouble?\" Thaddeus asked warmly. His eyes was filled with kindness as he looked over at Cassian, who was now sitting comfortably next to Fleur.\nFleur held Cassian’s hand, her eyes gleaming with satisfaction.\nThe young man wasn’t just easy on the eyes; he carried himself with a noble, gentle demeanor that impressed her. Even more, his devotion to Arix was something to be admired.\nAs both Fleur and Thaddeus observed Cassian, their approval of him grew by the second.\n\"No, no, Arix is doing very well. My parents like her so much. They even want her to stay a few more days,\" Cassian said quickly, his gaze dropping shyly, as if embarrassed by their attention.\nFleur laughed softly, her tone warm. \"We like you too, Cassian. Why don’t you stay a few more days and keep Arix company?\"\nCassian’s eyes lit up, though he tried to appear modest. \"Oh, would that be too much trouble for you?\"\nFleur gently chided him, \"Don’t be silly. You’ll soon be my son-in-law; we’re family.\"\nThaddeus, thinking Cassian was just being polite, smiled warmly. \"Exactly. She’s right. We’re family now, and you can stay with us for as long as you want.\"\n\"Thank you. I can wait,\" Cassian said, his voice full of gratitude. But as he spoke, his eyes briefly darted over to Scion on the other side of the table, a hint of smugness flashing in them.\nScion, however, was unfazed. He quietly focused on his pastry, completely ignoring Cassian’s attempt at a subtle power play.\nOnce Cassian felt he had made his point, he mentally scoffed. Then he turned his full attention back to chatting with Thaddeus and Fleur, the smugness in his gaze fading as he continued to bask in their approval.\nCassian’s attempts to charm her parents didn’t escape Arix’s watchful eyes.\nThe atmosphere might have seemed light and pleasant, but she was fully aware of his manipulative behavior.\nInstead of finding it irritating, though, Arix observed his smooth-talking with a sense of indulgence. She had always known Cassian could be both charming and a bit two-faced, but she found herself enjoying it, even occasionally playing along.\n\"Arix, do you like him?\" Vezgor suddenly asked in a soft voice.\nArix tore her gaze from Cassian and looked at her grandfather, nodding without hesitation.\nBefore, she might have just seen Cassian as her best friend. But now, understanding the depth of his feelings for her, she could no longer ignore the warmth in his eyes whenever he looked at her.\nArix just hoped that these budding romantic feelings wouldn’t grow too fast and distract her from the upcoming mecha competition.\n\"Is that so? Then that’s good.\" Vezgor’s expression softened, as if a weight had been lifted off his shoulders.\nHowever, the relief also seemed to weaken him, leaving him looking older and more fragile. It was as if the driving force that had kept him going was finally fading.\nArix noticed the change and felt a growing concern. A sudden image of her grandfather’s skeletal figure, something she had seen in a dream, flashed in her mind, filling her with a sense of dread.\nWithout thinking, she get closer and started observing him. She ignored his startled reaction, and checked his pulse, his eyes, and his skin. But Vezgor quickly backed up as if burned, his eyes filled with guilt. He struggled to find the right words to explain himself.\nThough the moment was brief, Arix had learned enough. Her heart sank, and panic filled her eyes.\nShe had foolishly believed that once her grandfather escaped the clutches of the Moon Goddess Temple, he’d be able to live a normal life. But now, she realized his pulse was weaker than that of someone gravely ill, so faint that making it to tomorrow seemed uncertain.\n’Does Mom know?’\nArix glanced toward Fleur, thinking of speaking up, but Vezgor quickly grabbed her wrist, his silent plea clear in his eyes.\n\"Arix, is something wrong?\" Fleur’s voice, filled with concern, broke through Arix’s thoughts.\nAt the sound of her mother’s voice, she felt her grandfather’s hand tremble slightly. After a moment’s hesitation, Arix decided to honor his wishes. She forced a smile and shook her head. \"No, nothing’s wrong.\"\nFleur still looked a bit uncertain but didn’t push the issue. She returned to her conversation with Cassian.\nWith the moment of suspicion passed, both Arix and Vezgor quietly exhaled in relief.\nThen, Arix shot her grandfather a stern look and whispered angrily, \"We’re having a serious talk after this banquet.\"\nVezgor could hear the real anger in Arix’s voice this time. He wanted to say something to comfort her, but she was done talking.\nAnnoyed, she began eating with exaggerated enthusiasm, even making loud chewing noises to express her frustration.\nCassian, thinking he was the cause of her sudden irritation, nervously kept adding more food to her plate.\nArix assured him it wasn’t his fault, but Cassian remained unconvinced. He became even more cautious around her.\nAfter a while, Arix sighed, feeling both amused and exasperated.\nUnder her grandfather’s amused gaze, she finally relented, returning to her normal pace.\nCassian, noticing this, let out a relieved sigh.\nFrom that point on, Cassian became increasingly attentive to Arix. He was always on edge, worried that he might accidentally overlook the girl he cared about so deeply.\nArix, seeing this, didn’t bother to correct him; she just let him continue with his newfound concern.\nAfter the banquet wrapped up, Arix was too lost in thought to engage much with anyone. She slipped away quietly and headed straight to her room.\nLater that night, when the moon hung high in the sky, the door to Arix’s room opened just a crack. She carefully stepped out, making her way to Vezgor’s door.\nShe knocked softly three times.\nVezgor, as if expecting her, responded with a resigned yet affectionate tone, \"Come in.\"\nArix entered to find her grandfather busy organizing his Space Button. Without missing a beat, he slid one toward her.\n\"Arix, this is for you. When I’m gone, the money in here will be enough for you to live without worries.\" Despite the grim topic, Vezgor seemed unusually relaxed, more at peace than he had been in a long time.\nArix stood there, fists clenched. She silently listened as her grandfather continued, almost as if he were giving his final instructions.\n\"Arix, I’ve failed your mother, and I can’t come up with a way to make up for it at the moment. When I’m gone, can you look after her for me? And also...\"\nVezgor, not noticing the shift in Arix’s demeanor, went on cheerfully, listing off his final wishes.\n\"Enough!\" Arix suddenly cut off Vezgor mid-sentence.\n\"These days, even an ordinary person can live to 150, and therians can reach 200 years. How is it that a therian like you, who’s only 60, is already in such a state? It’s because of me... isn’t it? It’s because of me that your life, which should have lasted naturally, has been reduced to just a few days.\"\nArix’s voice trembled with despair, and tears began streaming down her face.\nThe words Ignathor had spoken in her dream had already weighed heavily on her heart like a thorn. Now, hearing them confirmed, the guilt was unbearable.\nIf it weren’t for her, her grandfather could have had at least another hundred years ahead of him. But now, even making it to tomorrow seemed uncertain.",

      "content": "Chapter 243: Arix In A Coma\nVezgor had never imagined that his long-buried secret would be uncovered by his granddaughter. The shock and confusion hit him hard, but seeing Arix so devastated snapped him out of it quickly.\nWith trembling hands, he rushed over and gently wiped the tears from her face. \"Arix, this isn’t your fault. I’ve never regretted it, so please, don’t cry,\" Vezgor reassured her softly, his voice free of any blame.\nHe couldn’t possibly hold his own granddaughter responsible for this. Comforting her was all that mattered now.\nAfter a while, Arix began to calm down. But as the storm of emotions subsided, regret crept in. She couldn’t believe she had lashed out at her grandfather, the one who had always protected her.\nThe guilt weighed on her, and she quickly apologized. \"I’m so sorry, Grandpa. I shouldn’t have acted that way.\"\n\"It’s alright, really. I know you were just worried,\" Vezgor replied, relieved to see the tears finally stop.\nArix looked at her overly caring grandfather, and a fresh wave of tears brimming to spill.\nVezgor, seeing the familiar glimmer in her eyes, panicked. \"Sweetheart, please, no more tears. You nearly gave Grandpa a heart attack just now.\"\nArix nodded but then shook her head slightly. \"I won’t cry, but you have to promise me something.\"\n\"Anything, my dear. Just name it. I’d do anything to keep those tears away,\" Vezgor said, desperate to keep her from breaking down again.\nA small smile appeared on Arix’s face. \"Alright, Grandpa, wait here for a bit.\"\nShe quickly left the room and headed to her bedroom. Once inside, she locked the door and set up a psychic barrier.\n\"Arix, are you sure about this?\" Sylvana and the three little ones appeared from the psychic world, their concern evident.\nArix pulled out a scalpel and an empty potion bottle, her voice steady. \"If it weren’t for Grandpa, I wouldn’t be alive today. I’m just giving up a little blood in return.\"\n\"But this is Sylvana’s vital blood. You haven’t even fully inherited her power yet. Losing this could seriously harm you,\" Sylvana cautioned, her worry deepening.\n\"I understand the risks, but I can’t let Grandpa suffer because of me,\" Arix replied with determination. Without hesitation, she used the scalpel to pierce her chest.\nConcentrating, she drew out her heart’s blood with her psychic powers, letting it drip into the potion bottle.\n\"Arix!\" Sylvana tried to intervene, but Vita held her back.\nConfused and upset, she turned to him, questioning why he stopped her.\nVita simply shook his head, his voice laced with reluctant acceptance. \"Sylvana, if Arix were in danger, we’d do the same. When it comes to protecting those we love, sometimes we have to let them make their own choices.\"\nSylvana, though still worried, couldn’t argue. She turned away, unable to watch, her eyes tightly shut against the painful scene.\nArix gave Vita a thankful nod and continued to collect her heart’s blood, her resolve unwavering.\nWhen the potion bottle was finally filled with that golden blood, Arix stopped, her face terribly pale. As soon as she stashed the potion bottle into her Space Button, a sharp pain ripped through her chest.\n\"Ugh!\" Arix gasped, clutching her chest as the pain nearly brought her to her knees.\n\"Sylvana!\" The three little ones and Sylvana rushed to her side, their faces full of concern. They bandaged her chest as quickly as they could and tried to get her to drink a healing potion, their hands moving in a blur of frantic effort.\nBut despite their best attempts, Arix couldn’t hold onto her human form. She had given up too much vital blood. But instead of resting, Arix gritted her teeth and forced herself to stand, each step toward the door a painful struggle.\n\"Arix, can’t this wait until tomorrow? You need to rest,\" Vita said, his usual gentle tone replaced by frustration. She was already so weak, and yet she was still pushing herself.\nArix shook her head weakly but spoke with stubborn resolve. \"No, Grandpa can’t wait. I need to see him drink the potion with my own eyes. I won’t be able to rest until I know he’s okay.\"\nVita sighed, clearly worn down by her determination. And he finally offered, \"I’ll take it to him. You need to lie down.\"\nArix hesitated. She worried that her grandpa might not drink the potion if she wasn’t there. The promise she had made him earlier was her way of making sure he’d take it.\nSeeing her indecision, Vita’s patience snapped. For the first time, he lost his temper, \"You either rest now, or I’ll knock you out so you have to. Your choice!\"\nStartled by the outburst, Arix quickly handed him the potion, her voice almost pleading, \"Please make sure he drinks it.\"\nVita shot her a stern look. Then he grabbed the potion, and stormed out of the room.\nAs soon as Vita was gone, Arix’s body gave out. She let out a long sigh of relief before collapsing onto the bed, her energy completely spent.\nThe three little ones hovered close, worry etched on their faces.\nJust then, a flash of light enveloped Arix. Her body could no longer maintain its human form, and she reverted back to her tiger cub shape.\nCompletely exhausted, Arix drifted off into a deep, much-needed sleep.\nArix had been asleep for what felt like forever.\nEven in her drowsy state, she could sense that people had come and gone from her room, their voices carrying hints of worry.\n\"doctor, what’s happening to my daughter? How did she get so sick all of a sudden?\" Fleur’s voice, thick with anxiety, pierced through the fog in Arix’s mind, nudging her closer to wakefulness.\n’Mom? The doctor? Are they talking about me?’\nBefore she could gather her thoughts, the doctor’s voice cut through the haze.\n\"Your daughter isn’t in any serious danger. She just has a weakened immune system, which led to this illness. With some rest, she’ll be fine,\" The doctor explained, his tone calm and reassuring.\n\"That doesn’t make sense, Doctor. Arix’s physical power is above the Supergiant+ level. How could she have a weak immune system? Are you sure?\" Fleur asked, her confusion clear.\n\"I’m not sure, but the tests do show a weakened immune system,\" the doctor replied, sounding just as puzzled.\nArix didn’t catch much else as sleep pulled her back under.\nWhen she woke up again, she was startled to find herself aboard a passenger spaceship.\n\"Well, look who decided to join the land of the living,\" Drexel teased, glancing over as he cradled a tiger cub in his arms.\nArix, still feeling drained, managed to ask, \"Where are we?\"\n\"We’re on a ship heading back to the Alliance. You’ve been out cold for three days, Arix. You nearly gave everyone a heart attack, especially Cassian. If he didn’t have to lead the Empire’s mecha team in the upcoming competition, he probably would’ve come along,\" Drexel said, clearly relieved to see her awake.\n\"I’m sorry for making everyone worry. Can you let them know I’m awake and okay?\" Arix asked, too weak to do it herself.\n\"Sure,\" Drexel replied, quickly sending out messages. Then, his tone turned serious. \"Now, be straight with me. What really happened? With your power level, I don’t buy that a simple illness knocked you out for days.\"\nArix sighed, deciding it was better to come clean.\nDrexel had a way of digging into things until he found the truth, and hiding anything from him would only cause more trouble later.",

      "content": "Chapter 244: Assassinating Arix\nAfter she finished explaining, Drexel was quiet for a moment before speaking, his voice tinged with doubt. \"So, you’re saying this all happened because you were making a potion?\"\n\"Yeah, Grandfather’s illness is pretty severe, so making the potion was a bit tougher,\" Arix admitted, avoiding eye contact. She didn’t dare mention that she’d used her own heart’s blood in the process, which had actually caused her collapse.\nIf they found out, she knew she’d be in serious trouble.\nThankfully, Drexel let it go. He just sighed and gave her a gentle pat on the head. \"Next time, give us a heads-up about what you’re doing. You really scared everyone this time.\"\nArix nodded, knowing he was right. Then, with a mix of concern and curiosity, she asked, \"How’s Grandpa? Is he okay?\"\n\"Grandpa’s still asleep, like you were, but there’s nothing wrong with his body,\" Drexel said.\nArix nodded again. She knew that while her heart’s blood could heal him, it would take at least a month for the effects to fully work. His extended sleep was something she had expected.\nWith her worries finally eased, Arix snuggled deeper into Drexel’s arms, feeling a sense of comfort she hadn’t felt in a while. Casually, she asked, \"So, where are we headed next?\"\n\"First stop is the Alliance to regroup,\" Drexel replied, his hand gently brushing through her hair. \"After that, we’re off to the Empire of Eden for the first round of the mecha competition.\"\n\"Hmm? The Empire of Eden? Isn’t that the place with Alpha, Beta, and Omega genders?\" Arix asked, her curiosity piqued.\n\"Yep, that’s the one,\" Drexel confirmed, his voice carrying a hint of excitement. \"And get this—the captain of their national mecha team this time is an Omega. It’s pretty rare.\"\nArix raised an eyebrow, intrigued. It wasn’t that Omegas were looked down upon—it was just that they typically had lower physical strength compared to even Betas.\nSo, the idea of an Omega leading a mecha team in a high-stakes competition was both surprising and fascinating.\nIt was like picturing a gentle, unassuming rabbit at the head of a pack of fierce tigers and lions, ready to take on the world. The thought alone was enough to get anyone’s heart racing with anticipation.\nArix couldn’t shake her curiosity about this Omega, so she grabbed her opticomputer and dove into an online search.\nJust as she expected, the details about his abilities were tightly sealed. But she did find plenty of other stuff, like his measurements, hobbies, and even a few photos showcasing his impressive physique, six packs and major guns.\nArix couldn’t help but blush when she glanced at the photos, coughing a little to cover her reaction. This Omega was definitely something else...\nTime zipped by.\nBefore Arix knew it, midday had rolled around, bringing the spaceship to the capital planet of the Alliance.\nAfter stepping out of the passenger hall, the siblings hopped into their Lev vehicle and headed straight for the gathering point of the Alliance’s mecha team.\nTheir destination? The military district of the capital.\nBy the time they arrived, most of the other competitors for the mecha competition were already there.\nAdmiral Sykes of the Second Legion was leading the charge for this competition, flanked by Tactical Instructor Spears and Assistant instructor Kellan.\nThe national mecha team members were heirs from five major families: Arix, her brother Drexel, Deanna, Lydia, and Marco. The reserve team included Quinnie and two students from Koros Military Academy.\nAfter making the rounds and saying hello, Arix spotted her two close friends.\nThanks to her, the usually standoffish Cirilla and the sneakily clever Deanna got along reasonably well, even if they weren’t besties. When they saw Arix, they paused their chat and greeted her with warm smiles.\n\"Arix!\"\n\"Arix!\"\nNow back in her human form, Arix approached them with a grin. \"Why are you guys here so early?\"\n\"We live on the capital planet, so we got here quickly. How was your trip to the Empire of Sacred Moonlight with your brother? Have any fun?\" Deanna asked, clearly curious since she’d never been to the Empire of Sacred Moonlight.\nArix’s expression turned a bit sour. \"Fun? Let’s just say I’m more worn out than anything.\"\n\"Oh? What happened? Spill the details,\" Cirilla said, trying to hide her amusement.\nArix sighed, knowing she couldn’t fully explain the whirlwind of events in the Empire. It was like trying to describe something bitter without the right words. \"It’s complicated. Let’s just say I was paying off some debts.\"\nCirilla and Deanna exchanged a look, their eyebrows raised with knowing smiles. They didn’t usually enjoy others’ misfortune, but sometimes, exceptions were made.\nJust then, Admiral Sykes clapped his hands and called out energetically, \"Time to go! Let’s move out!\"\nWith that, Arix and her friends cut their conversation short and boarded the warship that would take them to Loran in the Empire. Since it was a long journey, each member of the mecha team got their own cabin to rest in.\nFeeling drained, Arix decided to skip dinner with her friends and headed straight to her cabin for some much-needed rest. But as soon as she opened the door, a familiar voice made her head throb.\n\"Arix, good afternoon.\" Quinnie had clearly been lurking, waiting for the perfect moment to greet her.\nArix turned to look at him, a bit of exasperation in her eyes, but she managed a polite nod before retreating into her cabin.\nArix’s clear avoidance would have made most people back off, but not Quispe. Instead, it brought a satisfied smile to his face.\nFeeling pleased, he opened the door to the cabin next to hers. However, his good mood quickly evaporated when he noticed a video request notification flashing on his opticomputer.\nQuispe briefly considered ignoring it but reluctantly accepted the call. The screen flickered to life, revealing Hardy’s face, twisted in frustration.\n\"Prince Quispe, care to explain what happened?\" Hardy sneered. \"You were supposed to assassinate Arix, but if I’m not mistaken, she just took a trip to the Empire and returned unscathed.\"\nThe frustration in his voice was palpable—he was inches away from strangling Quispe himself for missing such a prime opportunity.\nQuispe’s eyes shifted guiltily, though he tried to maintain an air of mystery and wisdom. \"You don’t get it. I didn’t want to raise any suspicions.\"\nHardy’s silence was damning, his expression clearly conveying disbelief. Still, he grudgingly allowed Quispe to continue, considering his royal status. \"Oh? Enlighten me.\"\nQuispe didn’t actually have a solid plan but quickly concocted one on the fly. \"With the mecha competition coming up, I’ll eliminate all those so-called geniuses during the event. Isn’t that better than just killing Arix?\"\nHardy stroked his chin, mulling over the unexpected logic in Quispe’s idea. Finally, he nodded. \"Not bad.\"\n\"See? Only someone as brilliant as me could think of that,\" Quispe boasted, a smug grin spreading across his face.\n\"But you’re just a reserve member. How do you plan to take them all out?\" Hardy pressed.\n\"Don’t worry, I’ve got a way to get into the competition. To be safe, let’s not chat too much and risk blowing my cover. Goodbye.\" Quispe quickly ended the call before Hardy could probe further.\nHardy didn’t mind the abrupt end to the conversation. Instead, he leaned back, a knowing smile playing on his lips, and ordered his subordinates, \"Prepare our forces to support Prince Quispe at any moment.\"\n\"Yes, Third Prince,\" his subordinate replied, hurrying off to carry out the command.\nMeanwhile, Hardy remained seated, his smile widening as he considered the possibilities.",

      "content": "Chapter 245: The Empire Of Eden\nIn the vast expanse of the universe, six warships emblazoned with the crest of the Empire of Eden stood guard at the edges of their territory.\nThe moment they detected unidentified vessels approaching, they swiftly shifted into defensive formations, ready for whatever might come.\nA voice boomed through the cosmos, carried by a powerful loudspeaker. \"This is the military of the Empire of Eden. Attention! You are entering restricted space belonging to the Empire of Eden, which poses a risk to flight safety. Identify yourselves, state your nationality, and explain your purpose!\"\nImmediately, the approaching warship halted in its tracks. The Empire of Eden’s forces then initiated a request for a communication link with the unknown ship.\nInside the control room of the Alliance warship, the crew established a connection, and soon enough, an officer from the Empire of Eden appeared on the screen.\n\"Greetings, you are in the active space of the Empire of Eden, which is considered a threat to flight safety. Please declare your nationality, identity, and reason for travel,\" the officer repeated firmly.\n\"Hello, Empire of Eden military. We are warships from the Alliance of the Stars, en route to participate in the 367th Freshman Mecha Competition. Requesting permission to proceed,\" replied Sykes, his tone measured and professional.\nThe officer from the Empire of Eden nodded politely. \"Understood. Please transmit your identification and travel documents for verification.\"\n\"One moment,\" Sykes responded, quickly sending over a holographic document bearing the seal of the Empire of Nolan along with his own Alliance ID.\nAfter a brief pause, the officer completed his checks. He offered a respectful salute, saying, \"All documents are in order. You may proceed. Safe travels.\"\nSykes returned the salute with a firm nod. \"Thank you.\"\nWith that, the Empire of Eden’s warships parted, creating a clear path for the Alliance vessels to continue their journey, seamlessly crossing into the Empire’s space.\nIn the lounge of the Alliance warship, a group of students, all representing the Alliance, sat wide-eyed, peering out the windows at the foreign warships surrounding them. For many, it was their first time in another nation’s territory, and the mix of awe and curiosity was palpable.\n\"This is incredible! It finally feels like we’re actual soldiers,\" Elio said, lifting his head with pride, his excitement spilling over.\nIt was the first time he had officially crossed into another country’s space, and he was filled with the same pride a rookie soldier might feel on their first day in uniform.\nDrexel, catching Elio’s enthusiasm, rolled his eyes and muttered, \"Can you try to act like you’ve been here before? We’re going to be soldiers soon anyway.\"\nElio shot back with a glare. \"But we’re not soldiers yet, are we? This is different!\"\nTheir playful banter drew a few chuckles from Arix and the others, lightening the mood in the room.\nJust then, the lounge door slid open, and Sykes walked in with purpose.\n\"Alright, team, we’ve officially arrived in the Empire of Eden,\" Sykes began, his voice carrying a tone of both authority and excitement. \"The competition kicks off in two days. Before then, I’m going to brief you on our opponents.\"\nHe tapped a control, and a large screen lit up in the lounge, ready to display the intel.\nElio and Drexel quickly stopped their joking around and joined everyone else in seriously listening to Sykes.\n\"These files were obtained through special channels, so I expect you all to keep them confidential. Understood?\" Sykes said sternly, his eyes scanning the thirteen students.\n\"Understood!\" the young men responded enthusiastically.\n\"Good. Let’s start with the Empire of Eden. The leader of their mecha team this time is an Omega, as I’m sure you’ve heard.\" As Sykes spoke, he brought up a photo of a young man on the screen.\nThe young man in the photo had delicate, feminine features, an extraordinarily beautiful face, and a gentle, harmless look. He looked like someone who needed protection, making it hard for anyone to feel any threat from him.\n\"Wow, he’s so... pretty? Even though he’s a guy, I think I could fall for him,\" Elio said, clearly infatuated with the delicate and gentle appearance of the Omega, despite knowing he was a boy.\nThe other students, too, were somewhat captivated by the Omega’s beauty, expressing their admiration.\nJust as everyone was absorbed in the Omega’s appearance, Sykes’s cold laughter broke the silence.\n\"Are you all thinking that since this weak-looking Omega is leading the Empire of Eden’s mecha team, you’ve already won?\" Sykes narrowed his eyes dangerously, staring at the group of students, who seemed to be thinking with their hormones rather than their brains.\nAlthough Sykes’s words were harsh, they hit the mark. Most of the students, though silent, had a look of disdain in their eyes.\nSykes noticed their dismissive expressions but, having been a hothead in his youth, understood their mindset. However, a little reality check was necessary.\nSykes suddenly turned his gaze to Arix. Then he asked the group, \"Do you think Arix is good-looking?\"\nArix was surprised.\n’What does this have to do with me?’\n\"Of course! My sister’s beauty is unmatched in the entire galaxy,\" Drexel was the first to loudly affirm.\n\"Exactly! I agree! Arix is the prettiest here,\" Elio added without considering anyone else’s feelings.\nThe other students nodded in agreement.\nCirilla and Deanna didn’t feel jealous; instead, they exchanged mischievous looks with Arix, clearly enjoying the situation.\nArix looked at them, mouth agape.\n’Why am I being dragged into this?’\n\"How many of you can actually beat her?\" Sykes cut through the compliments with an icy tone.\nThe entire lounge fell silent in an instant.\nAfter half a year of intense training together, all the students knew one thing very clearly: Arix might have the softest face, but she was the fiercest fighter. No one present could claim they hadn’t been beaten—both physically and mentally—by Arix at some point.\nEven Drexel, the strongest among them, usually only managed to fight Arix to a draw.\nThinking about this, the students swallowed nervously. They were starting to understand what Admiral Sykes was getting at.\nSuddenly, all the students glanced at Arix, then back at the young man in the photo.\nThe next time they looked at the photo, there was no trace of underestimation in their eyes. Instead, their gazes were filled with seriousness and respect.",

      "content": "Chapter 246: The Five Countries\nSykes observed the way everyone’s faces lit up with sudden understanding, and he nodded in approval.\nHe went on, \"The leader of the Eden’s mecha team is Blaze. He’s just sixteen, but this kid once used pure strategy to hold off 5,000 elite soldiers from the Empire of Sacred Moonlight all by himself. They say his intelligence is off the charts—literally. So, if you ever find yourself facing the Eden’s team, your top priority is to take HIM down.\"\nHearing this, Arix and the rest of the group nodded, their expressions serious, fully grasping the gravity of the situation.\n\"Now that we’ve covered their leader, let’s move on to his key team members. The Empire of Eden, much like our Alliance, has five admirals. It’s highly likely that their main players this time around will be the children of those admirals, just like on our team...\"\nSykes didn’t linger on the other members of Eden’s team like he did with Blaze. After all, at this level, everyone had powerful family ties. Unless someone’s skills really stood out, there wasn’t much point in focusing on them.\n\"So, those are the ones to keep an eye on from the Empire of Eden. Now, let’s turn our attention to The Empire of Mermen.\" When Sykes mentioned The Empire of Mermen, a slight frown crossed his face, showing his obvious dislike for them.\nArix had met some mermen before, but they weren’t from that Empire.\nOther students had never actually encountered anyone from the Merman Empire, though they had heard plenty about their looks—apparently, most of them were strikingly beautiful.\nThis definitely piqued the students’ interest as they leaned in to hear what Admiral Sykes had to say next.\n\"The Empire of Mermen is split into two factions: the Sirens and the Purebloods. Unfortunately, pureblood Mermen are extremely rare now, so the Sirens hold most of the power. The Sirens are naturally dangerous. Not only are they incredibly strong, but they also use their voices to lure ships to destruction. They’re infamous for causing shipwrecks. If you run into them in the arena, be cautious—not just of their strength, but especially of their singing.\" Sykes put extra emphasis on \"singing,\" making it clear that he had likely experienced it firsthand.\nHearing this, Arix and the others felt a bit let down. They had pictured Mermen as being sweet and beautiful, like the Disney princess. But now, they were being described more like the witch who poisoned her. It was a tough pill to swallow.\nNoticing the sudden shift in mood, Sykes awkwardly scratched his nose, realizing he might have just shattered their childhood fantasies.\nHe cleared his throat, a little flustered, and, as if to change the subject, said, \"Next, let’s discuss the third nation, which just so happens to be the current champion of the freshman mecha competition: the Empire of Sacred Moonlight’s mecha team.\"\nAs soon as Arix heard the words \"Empire of Sacred Moonlight,\" she sat up straighter, her eyes bright with interest. She couldn’t afford to miss anything about Cassian’s team.\nSykes spoke with a serious tone, \"I don’t need to say much about the Empire of Sacred Moonlight. They almost always take first place in the mecha competition every year. Especially their leader, Cassian. You’ve probably all heard of him. Don’t let his noble background fool you—his strength is the real deal. Ever heard of wormholes? The number of insectoids inside a wormhole is comparable to an insectoid wave. Once you’re in, it’s nearly impossible to get out alive. Even seasoned veterans like us might not make it, but Cassian managed to fight his way out on his own. That alone should tell you how powerful he is. And the rest of the werewolf mecha team? They’re not to be underestimated either. So, if you cross paths with them in the arena, my advice is to steer clear if you can. Only engage if you have no other option.\"\nThe students began to feel the weight of his words. It was clear that the Empire of Sacred Moonlight would be their toughest competition, not just for them, but for every other team in the mecha tournament.\nSykes noticed their growing concern and nodded in approval. He was glad to see them taking his warnings seriously. The last thing he wanted was for their youthful recklessness to push them into unnecessary dangers.\n\"Now, let’s talk about the last nation you need to keep an eye on—the Empire of Kraiton.\" When Sykes said this, he gave Arix a meaningful look, which left her puzzled before he continued, \"Kraiton is a nation made up of ordinary people, Sentinels, and Guides. Sentinels are the combatants, while Guides are responsible for calming and grooming the Sentinels’ Psychic Incarnations. Unfortunately, there are very few Guides with strong enough psychic abilities, so the Sentinels on Kraiton’s mecha team often don’t receive the support they need in time. This can cause them to mutate in the arena, leading to significant destruction in the past. They’re the team most likely to get red cards.\"\nA slight gloat flashed in Sykes’ eyes.\n\"I’ve heard about that mecha team. In past competitions, they usually finish last,\" Drexel remarked, rubbing his chin as he thought it over. Even though only the top five nations got to compete, always ending up at the bottom was still pretty humiliating.\n\"Seriously, why should we worry about the team that always comes in last?\" Elio scoffed. The Alliance mecha team might not be the top-ranked, but they were solidly in second place. Worrying about the team that consistently finished last seemed almost laughable.\nThe other students exchanged confused looks, not understanding why they should worry about a mecha team known for frequently getting red cards.\nSykes noticed their skepticism and, with a calm demeanor, took a sip of water before continuing, \"You’re right—that’s how it’s been in past years. But this year is different.\"\n\"What’s different? Did they somehow manage to recruit Supergiant-Class Guides?\" Drexel speculated, raising an eyebrow.\nSykes shook his head slightly before explaining, \"Not quite. While Sentinels are incredibly powerful, the stronger they are, the higher the risk of them mutating. And once a Sentinel mutates, the result is almost always catastrophic, either fatal or causing severe damage. That’s why, in previous mecha competitions, most teams had an unspoken rule to avoid provoking Kraiton’s mecha team. They knew that if left alone, the team would likely self-destruct, taking themselves out of the competition without any help.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 247: Traitor Of The Alliance\nSykes let a smirk play on his lips as he casually remarked, \"They might not have Supergiant-Class Guides anymore, but they’ve found better substitutes.\"\nThe room fell into a stunned silence, broken only by the collective gasp from the students.\nEvery year, internal issues forced the Empire of Kraiton to reserve three out of their ten slots on the mecha competition team for Guides. These Guides were seen as a glaring weakness—a liability that practically handed an advantage to their opponents from other countries.\nBut now? The idea of Kraiton eliminating this weakness was downright terrifying. Without this flaw, would they still be that restrained, easy-to-defeat team everyone was used to?\n\"Sir, stop teasing us! What kind of miracle cure did the Empire of Kraiton stumble upon? We need to prepare!\" Drexel’s voice wavered as he spoke, his face serious.\nAfter all, their next opponent was just as strong as the Empire of Sacred Moonlight. He barely managed to keep himself from cursing out loud.\nSykes took his time, letting his gaze sweep across the anxious faces of the students.\nOnly when the tension in the room hit its peak, with their frustration almost tangible, did he finally spill the beans. \"The thing that’s fixing Kraiton’s Sentinels? It’s none other than a psychic power healing potion.\"\nThe students were floored. \"What?\"\nA stunned silence took over before the room erupted into chaos.\n\"Wait a minute, isn’t that potion something we from the Alliance created? How on earth did Kraiton end up with it?\"\n\"Who the heck sold it to them? This is sabotage!\"\n\"We’re done for! I can’t believe one of our own turned traitor!\"\n...\nAs the students continued to vent, Arix tried to shrink into the background, hoping to avoid attention. Sure, she invented the Psychic Healer, but she didn’t sell it to the enemy.\n’Let them point fingers at the seller, not me!’\nSeeing the students getting more and more riled up, Sykes rolled his eyes, clearly annoyed, before he loudly cleared his throat to get their attention.\n\"Alright, enough with the wild accusations. If you keep this up, you’ll start suspecting even the janitor’s dog,\" Sykes said, exasperation lacing his voice.\n\"Then just tell us, Grandpa, who was dumb enough to help the enemy?\" Elio’s fists clenched, ready to confront whoever it was the moment his grandpa named them.\nSykes shot his grandson a look, wondering how he managed to be so clueless. A part of him was relieved that Elio wasn’t his direct descendant—otherwise, he might’ve lost his temper by now.\nWith a deep sigh and a sympathetic glance, Sykes finally revealed, \"The person responsible isn’t just anyone. It’s the President of the Alliance himself who authorized the sale of the psychic power healing potion to the Empire of Kraiton.\"\nElio’s angry expression froze, shock washing over him as his eyes widened. Because that \"traitor\" wasn’t just anyone—it was his own father.\nThe other students, who had been venting just moments ago, suddenly fell silent, too afraid to say a word. Who could’ve guessed that the one they were cursing was their own leader?\nThe room stayed quiet for a long, long time.\nIn the awkward silence that followed, Elio scratched his head, trying to find the right words. His mouth opened and closed a few times before he finally managed to say, a bit sheepishly, \"I’m sure the President had his reasons for this. We should trust him... right?\"\nThe other students exchanged glances, not entirely convinced. They couldn’t help but shoot Elio a few disdainful looks.\nAfter all, just moments ago, he was the loudest in his complaints, and now here he was, the first to backpedal.\nDrexel, who had kept quiet earlier because the psychic power healing potion was Arix’s invention, felt a wave of relief wash over him when he realized the President was responsible for the decision. He quickly jumped in, his tone a bit too cheerful. \"Yes, our President is wise and powerful. I’m sure he had a good reason for what he did.\"\nWhether there was a reason or not didn’t really matter to Drexel at this point. Shifting the blame was a lot more convenient.\nAs he spoke, Drexel’s eyes darted around the room, feeling pretty clever for how smoothly he was navigating this sticky situation. If anyone was going to get flak for this, it wouldn’t be him.\nElio, catching Drexel’s supportive words, felt a surge of gratitude. Of all people, he never expected Drexel—the one with the sharpest tongue in the group—to stand up for his dad.\n’Maybe our friendship is stronger than I thought.’\nElio gave Drexel an appreciative nod, his expression softening.\nDrexel, noticing Elio’s reaction, was taken aback. He felt his tiny conscience suddenly stung just a bit.\nSykes glanced over at Elio, who had just been cursing up a storm, but now looked as meek as a kitten.\nWith a smirk, Sykes decided to step in for his nephew, \"Listen up, folks. Our President isn’t an idiot; he wouldn’t cut a deal that leaves us in the red. Let me make it clear—offering the psychic power healing potion to the Empire of Kraiton isn’t just harmless; it’s actually a big win for our Alliance.\"\n’Wait, what? Helping the enemy is somehow a good idea?’\nEven though the students didn’t buy it, none of them dared to voice their doubts.\nThis involved the President, and right or wrong, it wasn’t their place to critique him.\nSykes could sense their skepticism, but he didn’t get mad. Instead, he felt a twinge of weariness.\nAfter all, when he first heard about this deal, he’d reacted much like they were now. He almost clocked his nephew during that meeting. Good thing his nephew president had explained fast enough, or Sykes would’ve hit the wrong guy.\nThinking back on it, Sykes’ expression softened. Feeling unexpectedly cheerful, he addressed the students, \"Just a month ago, the Empire of Kraiton and our Alliance struck a deal. We agreed that as long as we provide them with level-three psychic power healing potions during the competition, no matter where they place in the mecha tournament, the rights to this year’s international resource distribution go to us. That’s the trade-off.\"\n\"What? So, they’re basically working for us for free? Is the Empire of Kraiton out of their minds?\" Elio blurted out, clearly baffled and struggling to process what he’d just heard.\n\"They’re not just trying to scam us out of our psychic power healing potions, are they?\" Drexel chimed in, narrowing his eyes in suspicion. Clearly, he didn’t buy into this too-good-to-be-true deal.\n\"Yeah, even if that’s legit, what’s stopping them from backing out later?\" another student added, echoing the growing doubts in the room.\nTheir skepticism was understandable—if something seems too good to be true, there’s probably a catch.\nArix couldn’t shake the feeling that it couldn’t be this simple.\n’Why would an empire hand over such a big advantage for nothing? But the Alliance wasn’t dumb either. The most likely scenario was that they had something up their sleeve that could cripple the Empire of Kraiton.’\nRealizing this, a sly grin spread across Arix’s face.",

      "content": "Chapter 248: Arriving At The Eden\nSykes noticed the suspicious looks on the students’ faces and rolled his eyes.\nFinally, he cut in, sounding a bit annoyed, \"Alright, enough with the paranoia. I’ve been around a lot longer than you, so trust me—do you really think we’d just hand over such a prime opportunity without having a safety net?\"\nThe students fell silent, not daring to argue, though their doubtful eyes still told the story.\n\"As long as the main ingredient for the psychic healing potion, the Arix Crystal, remains exclusive to our Alliance, the Empire of Kraiton won’t dare cross us. Got it?\" Sykes declared, his tone daring anyone to challenge him.\nThe students, feeling the weight of Sykes’ gaze, swallowed their doubts and nodded along.\nOnly then did Sykes let his stern expression soften into a more relaxed smile. He continued, \"That’s all I have to say. By the way, tomorrow the Empire of Eden is throwing a national banquet. All competition participants are invited. Once we arrive in the capital, make sure you’re ready. I’ll take you all there.\"\n\"We understand,\" the students responded in unison, nodding obediently.\nSatisfied, Sykes gave a final nod and left the ship’s lounge.\nAs soon as Sykes was out of sight, the students started whispering among themselves. Most were still skeptical about the Empire of Kraiton’s intentions, while a few turned their attention to the upcoming banquet.\n\"Arix, did you bring a formal dress? If not, I have plenty; you’re welcome to pick one,\" Cirilla offered, pulling out a dozen high-end dresses.\n\"I didn’t, actually. Thanks, Cirilla,\" Arix replied, not hesitating to choose a deep blue dress from the selection.\n\"I’m glad you found what you like,\" Cirilla said with a smile. Then she turned to the other girls. \"You’re welcome to pick one too if you need it,\" she added generously.\nAs the eldest daughter of a prestigious Psychic Ware family, offering up a few dresses was nothing to her.\n\"Thank you, Cirilla,\" Deanna said, clearly excited. She had planned on wearing something casual, but now she was thrilled to have a more elegant option.\n\"Thanks, Cirilla, but I’m good. I’ve got a dress in my Space Button,\" Lydia responded. Coming from a family with scholarly ties, she was no stranger to banquets and always kept a dress ready.\nQuinnie, however, didn’t look as pleased. She reluctantly picked a dress, her smile tight and forced. \"Thanks, you’re too kind,\" she said, her tone betraying her discomfort.\n\"No problem. We’re all classmates,\" Cirilla replied, noticing but not dwelling on Quinnie’s odd behavior since they weren’t particularly close.\nAfter stowing the remaining dresses away, Cirilla returned to chatting with her closer friends.\n...\nA warship bearing the emblem of the Alliance dropped off all its participants in the capital of the Empire of Eden.\nRespecting the Empire of Eden’s warship regulations, it immediately turned around and flew towards the border.\nArix and the others watched the warship disappear into the distance before following Sykes and the instructors towards the exit of the docking hall.\nAs soon as they reached the entrance, a guide from the Eden was already there to lead the way.\nAlong the way, the students curiously observed the buildings and the Alpha and Omega citizens passing by.\nOne student stared at the back of an Omega’s neck for too long and was immediately called a pervert.\nThe student, confused and angry, was about to retort, but Drexel whispered something in his ear.\nSuddenly, the student blushed and repeatedly bowed his head to apologize.\nThe little Omega, now satisfied, snorted and continued with their shopping.\n\"Why did he apologize after getting scolded? He didn’t do anything wrong,\" Cirilla asked, bewildered.\nArix, amused, leaned in and whispered to Cirilla, \"The back of an Omega’s neck is like our private parts.\"\nCirilla’s eyes widened in shock. She then glared at the student and spat, \"Ew! You pervert!\"\nArix couldn’t help but laugh a little, feeling oddly relieved for the student. It was a good thing this Omega was nice; if it had been another, the student might have been in big trouble.\nAfter about ten minutes of walking, the guide from the Empire of Eden led them to the entrance of a luxurious hotel.\nThe Empire of Eden had arranged for the participants from each country to stay in five deluxe hotels, each with the emblem of their respective nations displayed at the entrance.\nArix glanced at the emblems outside each hotel before following the group into the hotel lobby.\n\"Honorable Admiral Sykes and participants, this hotel will be your accommodation during the competition. No outsiders will be staying here, so please feel at ease. The first floor has a 24-hour buffet for your convenience, and the second floor offers entertainment facilities, including several top-tier Connective Pods that are also open 24 hours. If you wish to train, the basement has a dimensional arena where you can create anything you want as long as it’s not a nuclear weapon,\" the guide explained enthusiastically.\nThe students eagerly looked around, especially Drexel, who nearly refused to leave after spotting the Connective Pods on the second floor. Arix had to drag him away so he could stay with the group.\nAfter finishing the tour, the guide gave a polite bow and said, \"This concludes the introduction. I will take my leave now. I wish you all an enjoyable stay. Goodbye.\"\n\"Thank you so much,\" Sykes nodded slightly, expressing his gratitude.\nThe guide, flattered, bowed again before turning to leave.\nAfter watching the guide depart, Sykes gave the students a few instructions before leaving with the instructors.\nThe students exchanged glances, then scattered excitedly to their favorite spots.\nDeanna wanted to go to the buffet on the first floor, so she said goodbye to Cirilla and Arix.\nAfter waving goodbye to Deanna, Cirilla grabbed Arix by the arm, practically dragging him toward the elevator.\n\"Arix, let’s check out the rooftop garden! I saw the cutest little animal up there earlier, and I just have to pet it again,\" she said, brimming with excitement.\nBefore Arix could get a word in, Cirilla had already pulled them into the elevator. Meanwhile, Lydia and Quinnie exchanged a quick, chilly nod before heading off in opposite directions.\nThe afternoon flew by as the students enjoyed themselves, making the most of the hotel’s amenities. By the time they regrouped in the lobby, everyone was buzzing with how impressive the place was.\n\"I swear, the Empire of Eden might be trying to weaken our resolve with all this fun and amazing food,\" Drexel said, lounging on a sofa with a content but mock-serious expression.\n\"Totally. I’m starting to believe it,\" Elio chimed in, rubbing his very full stomach before letting out a satisfied burp.\nVarden glanced up from the book they’d been engrossed in, adjusting their frameless glasses with a mix of disdain and neutrality. \"If this is all it takes to weaken your resolve, maybe it wasn’t that strong to begin with.\"\n\"Exactly! Don’t throw around words like ’resolve’ so lightly,\" Cirilla added, not holding back. \"Just look at Zephyr and Marceau—they spent the whole afternoon in the Dimensional Training Field. That’s what I call real resolve.\"\nElio, unwilling to let it go, shot back, \"You and Arix were playing around on the rooftop, too! You’re in no position to lecture us.\"\n\"Oh, really, Elio?\" Cirilla responded, a mischievous glint in her eye. \"Feeling bold now? How about we settle this in the basement arena? If you win, I’ll admit you’re right.\"\nElio’s bravado vanished as quickly as it had appeared. \"Uh, suddenly I really need to use the restroom,\" he mumbled, quickly excusing himself and hurrying off to dodge the challenge.\nCirilla rolled her eyes, clearly unimpressed. \"The only thing sharp about him is his tongue.\"\nThe whole group burst into laughter.",

      "content": "Chapter 249: Paradiso And Inferno\nThe room was filled with laughter and banter. Zephyr, the leader of the Alliance mecha team, cleared his throat, and then he brought the lighthearted mood to a halt. \"Alright, let’s take a break from the jokes.\"\nZephyr’s voice carried weight. The moment he spoke, everyone fell silent, even Cirilla straightened up, abandoning her playful antics.\nOnce the room was calm, Zephyr continued, \"Before we dive into the competition, there are a few things we need to cover, like how we’ll be splitting into teams and some key points to keep in mind.\" The group nodded, fully focused, not daring to interrupt.\n\"As you’re all aware, the mecha tournament spans five rounds, each one hosted by a different nation. Typically, they choose the most hazardous planet within their borders for the competition. We’ll worry about the other rounds later, but let’s start with what we know about the Empire of Eden’s round.\" As Zephyr spoke, he activated a 3D projection.\nThree planets appeared in the air: a dull gray one, a pitch-black one, and a glaring purple one. Arix and the others shifted their attention to the display, their interest piqued.\n\"The gray planet, Crakens, was reported to be overrun by insectoids last month. If this is where we compete, it shouldn’t be too hard. We’ve all faced insectoids before,\" Zephyr said, swiftly moving on to the next planet.\n\"The black planet, Paradiso, is one of the Empire of Eden’s greatest failures. For reasons still unknown, it transformed overnight from a bustling tourist spot to a dead world. The Empire sent their best reconnaissance team to investigate, but they never returned.\" Zephyr’s tone darkened, and a serious expression took over his face. The real danger is always in the unknown, making Paradiso a truly terrifying prospect.\nThe group grew tense, realizing this might be where they’d end up fighting.\n\"And finally, the purple planet, Inferno. Recent intel says this planet is crawling with a mysterious virus that drives people mad, turning them against each other. There’s no cure as of now,\" Zephyr finished his breakdown of the potential locations.\nHe glanced around the room, asking, \"These three planets are the most likely candidates for the Empire of Eden’s round. What do you all think? Which one seems the most probable?\"\nA heavy silence fell over the room as the students weighed the possibilities. Each planet seemed equally terrifying in its own way.\nJust then, Elio, who had slipped back in without anyone noticing, pulled out a piece of paper and started writing something at his desk.\nDrexel, curious, leaned over to peek, only to see the bold words \"Last Will and Bucket List\" scrawled across the top.\nDrexel was at a loss for words.\nAll he could think was, \"Classic Elio.\"\nInstead of feeling embarrassed, Elio caught Drexel’s eye and, with a smirk, handed him another sheet of paper along with a pen. \"Here, Drexel, I got one for you too. No need to thank me,\" Elio offered with mock generosity.\nDrexel stared at the large letters on the paper for a long moment before forcing a tight smile, \"Thanks, but no thanks. I’m good.\"\nElio just shrugged, \"Tch, some people just don’t appreciate a thoughtful gesture,\" he muttered before turning to the others. \"Anyone else want one?\"\nThe group shook their heads in unison, their faces full of disdain.\nElio sighed dramatically, \"Such a shame. If I didn’t have a royal title waiting for me, I wouldn’t bother with this either. Feels like I’m tempting fate.\"\nThe others stared at him, feeling a mix of irritation and disbelief.\nSeriously, Elio? Humblebrag much?\nAs the conversation started to drift off course, Zephyr cleared his throat and sent a sharp, icy glance in Elio’s direction.\nElio, catching the hint, quietly tucked away his \"bucket list\" without a word.\nOnce order was restored, Zephyr turned back to the group. \"Alright, now that we’ve had some time to think it over, which planet do you all believe is the most likely candidate?\"\nThe students hesitated for a moment, glancing at each other before most of them pointed to the second planet, the black Paradiso. It made sense; historically, each country chose the most challenging planet within their territory for the competition.\nBut then, Arix, after a moment of consideration, pointed to the purple planet, Inferno, which no one else had chosen.\nZephyr noticed and raised an eyebrow, intrigued. \"Arix, what makes you choose Inferno?\"\nArix blinked, a bit surprised to be singled out. It was a gut feeling. But with Zephyr waiting, Arix knew she had to give a reason.\nAfter a brief pause, she finally spoke up. \"Paradiso does seem like the most obvious choice, but it’s so dangerous that the Empire of Eden would have to be crazy to risk the backlash from the entire interstellar community by sending us there.\"\nThe other students listened carefully, some of them slowly starting to reconsider their choices and inch their fingers toward the purple Inferno.\nZephyr nodded in approval. \"You’re spot on. There’s another critical factor— even if the Empire of Eden wanted to hold the competition on Paradiso, the other four major powers wouldn’t agree to send their top mecha teams to a planet where survival is nearly impossible. So, I also believe that Inferno will be the competition planet.\"\nWith that, Zephyr confidently raised his hand and pointed to Inferno, signaling his agreement.\nDrexel was the last one to make a choice, and with all eyes on him, he hesitated before pointing to the gray planet, Crakens.\nZephyr, assuming Drexel had some logic behind his decision, asked seriously, \"Do you have a reason for choosing Crakens?\"\n\"Reason? Uh, no, not really,\" Drexel replied, looking genuinely confused.\n\"Then why did you pick it?\" Zephyr pressed, his eyes narrowing in frustration.\n\"Huh? Can’t I? The other two planets already had people picking them, so I felt bad for this lonely planet and chose it,\" Drexel answered innocently, blinking as if this was the most obvious thing in the world.\nZephyr rolled his eyes.\n’Great. This is so Drexel. Only he would do something like this!’\nZephyr took a deep breath, trying to maintain his composure. Finally, in a cold, measured tone, he said, \"Drexel is disqualified from choosing. For the next three seconds, everyone finalize your decision. If there are no more issues, we’ll go with the majority vote to decide which planet we’ll prepare for.\"\nAs the countdown hit 3, 2, 1, everyone pointed to Inferno. The last person, who hesitated for a moment, quickly shifted their hand from Paradiso to Inferno.\nWith a final vote tally of 12:0:0 (excluding Drexel), Inferno was overwhelmingly chosen as the most likely planet for the competition. Inferno was now the focus of their preparation.\nWith the decision made, Zephyr deleted the other two planets from the screen, then brought up detailed information about Inferno for everyone to study.\nName:\nInferno\nOwnership:\nThe Empire of Eden, privately owned by Admiral Cuss\nDescription:\nInferno’s atmosphere is contaminated with an unknown virus that induces mental instability, leading to violent behavior. Currently, there is no cure.\nCreatures:\nSince the virus outbreak, all flora and fauna have mutated into corrupted beasts. Danger level: Level-three.\nSpecial Warning:\nPsychic power can temporarily resist the virus, but if you experience dizziness, leave Inferno immediately, or you’ll be in mortal danger.\nAdditional Note:\nDo not tempt fate. Cherish your life and stay away from Inferno.",

      "content": "Chapter 250: Merman Hunks\nThe students carefully read through the details, but the final warning went ignored. Fear of death and danger was a luxury they couldn’t afford. As military students, they had long come to terms with the potential for sacrifice.\n\"Does anyone have any suggestions after reading this?\" Zephyr asked, clasping his hands and looking at the group as they processed the information.\n\"Captain, will this competition still focus on resolving the planet’s crisis, like the previous ones?\" Drexel was the first to raise his hand, surprising everyone with a relevant question.\n\"Yes, that’s likely the case,\" Zephyr replied, his expression softening a bit. For once, Drexel was on point. Though Drexel could be a handful, he had his moments of clarity. This was one of them.\n\"Alright, then I have no further questions,\" Drexel said, sitting up straight and falling silent.\nWith a sigh, Zephyr turned his attention to Varden. \"Varden, do you have any suggestions?\"\nThe Brant family, Varden’s family, was the most renowned potion-making family in the Alliance, and given that this competition revolved around a deadly virus, Varden was arguably their most crucial asset.\nAll eyes turned to Varden, expecting a solution. But instead, Varden shook his head and said, \"Our family has done some research on the virus from Inferno. We know that the stronger your psychic power, the longer you can resist infection. But, to be honest, this virus hasn’t been a primary focus for us, so progress has been limited.\"\nZephyr’s face fell slightly in disappointment. \"I see,\" he muttered, clearly hoping for better news.\n\"Don’t lose hope just yet,\" Varden continued. \"While I don’t have the answer, there might be someone who does.\" He then turned his gaze toward Arix. \"What do you think?\"\nZephyr’s eyes brightened as he realized what Varden was hinting at. Of course! How could they have overlooked Arix? She was the one who developed the psychic power healing potion. If anyone could tackle this virus, it was her.\nThe other students quickly caught on, their excitement mounting as they all looked expectantly at Arix.\nArix, feeling the weight of their stares, blinked in confusion. Finally, she asked, \"You’re not seriously thinking I can solve this virus, are you?\"\nEveryone nodded in unison.\nArix facepalmed.\n’Thanks for the trust, but I really don’t think I can do it!’\nshe thought, suddenly overwhelmed.\n’How can anyone promise to defeat a virus they’ve never encountered before, especially one from another star system?’\nHer mind flashed back to a previous experience that made her blood run cold.\nArix still remembered the struggle of dealing with the virus that had infected Torvak. That one had been so complex it nearly drove her to the brink of insanity.\nThe worst part about interstellar viruses wasn’t just their danger, but their ability to evolve in unpredictable ways.\nSeeing Arix’s strained expression, the group began to realize they might be asking too much of her. It wasn’t fair to put all the responsibility on her shoulders—it was a team effort.\nDrexel, usually the most easygoing of the group, suddenly spoke up with uncharacteristic seriousness, his gaze sharp as he looked at everyone. \"Arix, just do what you can. It’s okay if it doesn’t work out.\"\nThe other students, feeling a bit guilty, quickly echoed Drexel’s sentiment. \"Yeah, just give it your best shot.\"\nFinally, Zephyr, as the leader, stepped in to make the final call. \"For this competition, Arix will focus on studying the virus, with Varden assisting her. The rest of us will take care of their safety.\"\nThe students all nodded in agreement. It was the most sensible approach, and it spread the responsibility across the team.\n\"But I can’t promise success,\" Arix said, still worried. She wasn’t about to let pride push her into an impossible task.\n\"It’s okay,\" Zephyr reassured her. \"Even if things don’t go as planned, we’ll all understand, right?\" He turned to the group, his cold gaze daring anyone to disagree.\nAfter a brief hesitation, everyone nodded vigorously.\nSeeing their support, Arix reluctantly accepted the task, feeling a bit better knowing she wouldn’t be alone in this.\nWith that, the meeting wrapped up.\nZephyr finalized the necessary precautions and outlined the team assignments. Since they all had to attend a state banquet the next day, he reminded everyone to get some rest.\nWith that, he headed back to his room, leaving the team to prepare for the challenge ahead.\n...\nThe next day, the Alliance’s mecha team took off in a mini spaceship proudly displaying their national emblem.\nThey headed for the grand banquet hosted by the Empire of Eden. The event was set in the royal banquet hall, deep within the palace.\nSince they couldn’t land the spaceship inside, Arix and the others had to park outside and walk the rest of the way.\nThey weren’t too bothered, though. Arms linked with friends, they strolled along, chatting and laughing as they made their way to the palace.\n\"Wow, this place is really something,\" Deanna said, eyes wide with awe. Growing up on Planet Void, she wasn’t used to such luxury, and the intricate architecture immediately caught her attention.\nArix and Cirilla were more familiar with grand buildings. But even they couldn’t help admiring the unique surroundings.\nAfter a bit of excited chatter about the architecture, the group started to lose interest.\nEven Deanna, who had been thrilled at first, began to feel a bit worn out. She glanced away from the buildings, a thought suddenly crossing her mind. \"Hey, apart from us, there are other countries coming to this banquet, right?\"\n\"Yep, there are representatives from five major countries,\" Arix replied, giving Deanna a puzzled look.\nDeanna raised an eyebrow, then leaned in with a playful grin. \"So, how did the Empire of Merman get here? Did they show up in fish tanks or something?\"\nArix and Cirilla were both speechless.\nFor a moment, there was complete silence before Cirilla burst into laughter. \"Haha, that’s too good! Arix, your cousin is hilarious,\" she said, trying to catch her breath.\nArix sighed, feeling a bit exasperated, but she couldn’t blame Deanna. She was fresh from Planet Void and didn’t know much about these things.\nArix patiently explained, \"Mermen only need fish tanks until they’re about ten. After that, they develop legs and can switch between tails and legs whenever they want.\"\n\"Oh, got it. Too bad, though—I was hoping for some watery surprises,\" Deanna pouted, looking a little disappointed.\n\"Haha, Deanna, I didn’t know you had this side to you! Does your brother know?\" Cirilla teased, grinning.\nArix suddenly remembered something and leaned in closer to Deanna, a mischievous glint in her eye. \"Don’t give up just yet. Our third competition is in the Empire of Merman. The place is 99% water, so you’ll get all the wet surprises you’re dreaming of.\"\n\"That’s just perfect,\" Cirilla said, shaking her head in amazement.\n\"Arix, you’re a genius!\" Deanna exclaimed, giving him a thumbs up.\nArix flashed them a bright smile, his teeth gleaming.\nStill laughing and joking, they finally reached the entrance to the royal banquet hall. Just as they were about to enter, they bumped into the mecha team from the Empire of Merman, who had arrived at the same time.\nAnd no, the mermen didn’t show up in fish tanks. Instead, they each had long, muscular legs.\nArix tilted her head, curiously observing the competitors from the Empire of Merman.\nThese legendary Siren mermen weren’t the blonde, blue-eyed, fair-skinned princes you’d expect from fairy tales.\nInstead, they stood tall at about 1.9 meters, with strong, dark skin and a posture that made them seem tough and unapproachable. Their chiseled faces were marked with small patches of fish-scale tattoos, the only visible sign of their Siren heritage.\nArix swallowed nervously, quickly looking away, afraid to keep staring at these rugged, incredibly attractive men.\nIf she kept looking, she might start having inappropriate thoughts.\n’It’s not that I have weak willpower,’\nshe reasoned to herself,\n’it’s just that their muscles are too tempting!’\nThe leaders of both mecha teams nodded to each other, a silent acknowledgment, before preparing to enter the hall.\nThe waiting attendants immediately bowed at a 90-degree angle and led the groups to their assigned seats.\nAs they entered, the two mecha teams exchanged curious glances.\nThe girls on Arix’s team, in particular, noticed that the Siren mermen were staring at them with a certain intensity.\nThe boys from the Alliance quickly stepped in, positioning themselves to shield Arix and the other girls, as if ready to defend them.\nSeeing the girls being covered up, the Siren mermen let out a proud, disdainful snort before following the attendant to another corner of the hall.\nOnce the Siren mermen were out of sight, Arix turned to Drexel, her curiosity getting the best of her. \"What just happened? Why did their looks seem so... strange?\"\nCirilla and the other girls nodded in agreement. While the mermen were undeniably handsome, their blatant stares felt almost like harassment.\nDrexel hesitated, unsure how to explain.\nHe couldn’t exactly tell them that the Siren mermen, known for being somewhat notorious, were probably trying to flirt with them and might even be thinking about hybrid babies. Saying that might make him seem like the one being inappropriate.\nAfter a long pause, Drexel finally managed to say, \"Just keep your distance from them unless you’re interested in having mermen hybrid babies.\"\nThe girls froze for a moment, then the realization hit.\nThey finally understood the true meaning behind the Siren mermen’s gazes.\nInstantly, their reactions varied—some blushed in embarrassment, some cursed under their breath, and others glared in anger.\nOut of all of them, Cirilla looked the most upset. She had assumed those looks were a challenge, like they wanted to pick a fight.\nBut now, understanding their real intentions, she fumed, \"I thought they were seeing me as a rival, but they were actually trying to hit on me?!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 251: The Pureblood Merman\n\"Maybe having a hybrid merman baby wouldn’t be such a bad idea,\" Deanna mused aloud, her eyes distant and dreamy as she glanced toward the corner where the merman mecha squad was stationed.\nArix, caught off guard by Deanna’s comment, looked at her curiously. Following her line of sight, Arix spotted a small, blond-haired, blue-eyed merman, barely noticeable behind the much larger Siren mermen.\n’Wait... is that a pureblood merman?’ Arix furrowed her brow, studying the little merman who had somehow escaped everyone’s attention until now.\nBeyond his striking features, he looked less than thirteen.\n’But what’s a kid like that doing in a national mecha squad?’\nArix wondered.\nThe whole situation didn’t add up. No country would risk putting a child in such a dangerous position, especially not in the highly competitive Empire of Merman.\nArix continued to think,\n’So, why has the Siren mermen included him in their elite squad? Is it... that this kid is some kind of prodigy?’\nBut then, something else caught her eye—faint scars crisscrossing the little merman’s neck. They didn’t look like the kind you get from accidents; these looked more like the result of years of abuse.\nEverything about this kid screamed hardship, reinforcing the rumors that life for a pureblood merman was anything but easy.\nArix observed him a bit longer, but she quickly dismissed any thoughts of stepping in. This wasn’t her problem. They were rivals here, and helping him would only strengthen an enemy. She wasn’t about to give them any advantages.\nBesides, she didn’t really know this little merman even needed help.\nRemembering the cold, hard look in his dark eyes—eyes that showed no sign of weakness—Arix smirked. If the Siren mermen crossed this pureblood merman unknowingly, they might regret it in the future.\nWith a sense of quiet amusement, Arix took a sip of her drink.\nThere was still some time before the banquet officially began, so Arix glanced around, her boredom growing. The room was filled with nobles and big-time businessmen from the Empire of Eden, the kind of people most could only dream of meeting.\nBut Arix wasn’t all that interested in them. After a quick look, her attention shifted back to the mecha teams gathered for the tournament.\nThe team from the Empire of Eden, as the hosts, had arrived first and were mingling with practiced grace. Meanwhile, the Empire of Merman’s team was busy flirting with every woman they could find—nothing noteworthy there.\nThe most norma group had to be the squad from the Empire of Kraiton. They were preoccupied with doting on their Psychic Incarnations, whether furry or scaly.\nArix watched them closely, noting that the Sentinels’ Psychic Incarnations seemed to reflect their owners’ personalities. A lively owner had a lively Incarnation; a cold owner had an aloof one.\nIn contrast, the Psychic Incarnations from the Alliance were more like separate beings with their own memories and consciousness.\nNeither type was inherently better or worse; each had its own set of strengths and challenges.\nSatisfied with her observations, Arix turned her gaze toward the entrance, wondering what would happen next.\nAs the banquet’s start time approached, Arix noticed that the Empire of Sacred Moonlight’s delegation was still nowhere to be seen.\n\"Cassian’s taking his sweet time, huh?\" Arix murmured, setting down her glass and propping her chin up in mild boredom.\nBut just as Cassian crossed her mind, a stir of excitement swept through the room near the entrance.\nArix instantly perked up, her attention snapping to the door. And there they were—the mecha team from the Empire of Sacred Moonlight.\n’Wait, what?’\nArix blinked, taken aback for a moment when she recognized the leader of their team. She hadn’t expected to see Scion leading them!\nHer initial surprise quickly turned into joy as she caught sight of him. Arix gave a friendly wave.\nScion, usually so stoic, seemed to soften when he saw her. He even managed a small smile and nodded in acknowledgment.\nAfter exchanging greetings with Scion, Arix’s eyes shifted to the group following behind him. When she spotted Cassian, her smile widened, and she waved eagerly.\n\"Cassian, over here!\"\nCassian, who had been sulking just a moment ago, immediately brightened up.\nWith a quick word to his team, he broke away and headed straight for Arix, paying no mind to the stunned looks on his teammates’ faces. They seemed utterly shocked that someone would address their esteemed prince so casually.\nCassian, wearing a warm smile, took the seat beside Arix. He gave a polite nod to Drexel and the others before turning his full attention to Arix, concern etched on his face.\n\"Arix, are you feeling better?\" he asked, his voice gentle.\nArix had left the Empire under the weather, and Cassian had been worried about her ever since.\n\"Yep, I’m all good now,\" Arix assured him with a sweet smile, shaking her head to ease his concern.\n\"Glad to hear it.\" Cassian didn’t scold her, though, as he might have in the past. Instead, he affectionately patted her long hair.\nArix didn’t pull away, letting Cassian’s hand glide gently over her hair.\nDrexel, seated nearby, could barely stand their affectionate display. Pretending not to notice, he eventually rolled his eyes and quipped, \"Could you two at least try to be considerate of us single folks?\"\nCassian and Arix exchanged amused glances before settling back into their seats, content and in sync.\nThe sight of Cassian and Arix together left the rest of the Alliance mecha squad completely floored. Their mouths hung open in shock.\n’Isn’t this young man the leader of the Sacred Moonlight mecha team?’\nBoth the Alliance and Empire squads were filled with disbelief, but a sense of dread quickly followed.\nEach side worried that the other might steal away their leader or a crucial member.\nThe Empire mecha team was in an even tougher spot since it was their own leader who had voluntarily crossed over. All they could do was glare with furious eyes, too fearful to make a real move.\nOn the other hand, the Alliance squad secretly reveled in seeing the top-ranked Sacred Moonlight team at such a rare disadvantage.\nElio, feeling particularly smug, cast a taunting glance at the Sacred Moonlight team. Then, with exaggerated politeness, he turned to Cassian and asked, \"So, you’re Crown Prince Cassian of the Empire, right?\"\nCassian gave a polite nod and, with a smile, introduced himself. \"Nice to meet you all. I’m Arix’s fiance. Just call me Cassian.\"\nThe room was full of polite smiles until Cassian mentioned that he was Arix’s fiance.\nSuddenly, those smiles vanished, replaced by looks of utter shock.\nElio’s face, in particular, darkened like an impending storm.\n\"Drexel! If your family can’t afford to keep a daughter, just let me know! How could you hand over our Alliance’s precious gem to the Empire?!\" Elio hissed furiously at Drexel, leaning in so close that the venom in his voice was almost palpable. He looked like he was ready to shake the Kering family to see if they’d completely lost their minds.\nAfter all, Arix was always seen as the future hope of the Alliance! And now that hope had been sent off to the Empire? It felt like a punch to the gut.\nAt first, Elio had thought they had successfully lured a key figure from the enemy. But now it turned out that their own precious person had been snatched away.\nElio looked like he was about to keel over.",

      "content": "Chapter 252: Getting Arix Back\nSeeing Elio’s nearly fainting expression, Drexel remembered his own reaction when he first found out. He had nearly grabbed a weapon and stormed the Empire of Sacred Moonlight himself. So, he fully understood what Elio was going through right now.\nBut this was a deeply personal matter involving his sister, and Drexel couldn’t reveal too much. He awkwardly rubbed his nose and muttered, \"They’re in love. What could we do about it?\"\n\"Love my foot! Drexel, I’m realizing just how utterly useless you are! Couldn’t you have done something to sabotage this?\" Elio snapped, clearly frustrated.\n\"Sabotage?\" Drexel looked at Elio in horror. \"I’m not some kind of villain or a meddling side character—why would I want to wreck my sister’s future?\"\n\"If you don’t do something soon, it’ll be too late! Or do you actually plan to let your sister marry into the Empire?\" Elio’s face twisted in anguish, like this was more his problem than anyone else’s.\nThis wasn’t something that could wait. If they were already this open about their relationship today, Elio thought, then Arix would probably be pregnant the next time they met!\nDrexel was speechless. His family had accepted this long ago, so it was too late to change anything anyway...\nOf course, Drexel kept that to himself; the last thing he wanted was to push Elio completely over the edge!\nDrexel hesitated for what felt like forever before finally blurting out, \"Elio, just hear me out. Stop stressing over this—it’s already a done deal. The only way to stop it now is if you overthrow your father’s government and become the president of the Alliance.\"\nHe meant it as a joke, a way to tell Elio to just let it go. But instead of calming down, Elio’s eyes suddenly lit up like he’d just had the most brilliant idea.\n\"Yeah! Why don’t I just overthrow Dad and become president? Then I can stop our precious Arix from being married off to the Empire! Hold on, let me think... Does my dad have any skeletons in his closet?\" Elio said, quickly pulling out his opticomputer and scrolling through his father’s records.\n’Oh great, the dutiful son is about to \"kill\" his own father with his intense filial piety!’ Drexel facepalmed, utterly speechless at how things had escalated.\nAs Elio’s mad plan began to take shape, Drexel sighed and hesitated for a moment before deciding to type out the real reason behind Arix’s engagement. He sent the message over to Elio, hoping it would stop him from making things worse.\nElio received the message and shot Drexel a confused look before opening it. As he read through it, his face gradually turned from determined to completely stunned. Finally, he looked up at Drexel, his voice full of disbelief. \"Is this for real?\"\nDrexel rolled his eyes in exasperation. \"Why would I lie to you? If it wasn’t for this, do you think the Kering family would’ve agreed to something like this?\"\nElio was so shocked by the truth that he slumped onto the nearest couch, utterly defeated. All he could think was one thing:\n’Arix is gone, Arix is gone, Arix is gone...’\nThe other members of the Alliance mecha squad, noticing Elio’s reaction, started exchanging curious glances.\nSlowly, their eyes turned toward Drexel, clearly itching to know what was going on.\nDrexel was at a loss for words. \"Why is everyone looking at me? If you’re curious, maybe you should be asking the folks across the room!\"\nDrexel, though at a loss for words, knew he had no choice but to accept the situation. So, he spent some time fine-tuning a message on the opticomputer.\nAfter a bit of editing, he sent a heavily censored version of the explanation to his teammates.\nWhen the guys read through the filtered message, they got the gist of it. But their faces still wore that sour look. It wasn’t surprising—they were frustrated that something precious from their homeland had been taken away.\nMeanwhile, as the guys were stewing in their disappointment, the girls had their attention focused on Cassian.\nCirilla, especially, was thrilled, exclaiming, \"So, it’s true, you two are really together!\"\nShe and her somewhat silly brother had already picked up on the connection between Cassian and Arix, so this news wasn’t exactly a shock.\nUnlike Cirilla, who had that smug \"I knew it\" expression, Cassian took a second to place her.\nThough her brother could be a bit of a handful, Cassian remembered that Cirilla had always been kind to Arix. So, with a polite smile, he said, \"Yes, Arix and I have been together for a while now. Your name’s Cirilla, right? Thanks for looking after Arix.\"\nCirilla waved off the thanks, saying, \"No need! Arix is like a sister to me, so it’s just natural. Honestly, it’s hard to say who was taking care of whom.\"\nHer straightforwardness got a laugh out of everyone, and thanks to Cirilla breaking the ice, the rest of the Alliance loosened up and started peppering Cassian with questions, which he answered politely.\nThe friendly vibe caught the attention of other teams. Some started to pay close attention, while others watched quietly from the sidelines.\n\"Captain, looks like the Alliance Mecha squad and the Werewolf Mecha squad might join forces in this competition. Should we be ready for that?\" a member of Eden’s Mecha team whispered to his captain.\nBlaze, sipping on a glass of grape juice, responded with a laid-back smile, \"Sure, the leader of the Werewolf Mecha squad has a good rapport with the Alliance, but that doesn’t mean his whole team is on the same page.\"\nHis smile grew as his gaze settled on one of the Werewolf Mecha squad members, his eyes sharp and calculating.\nOn the other side, within the Empire of Sacred Moonlight, the owner of those sharp eyes spoke in a taunting tone, \"As a leader, he’s off mingling with the Alliance Mecha squad instead of doing his job. Someone like that isn’t fit to be our captain!\"\nKares’s voice dripped with sarcasm, clearly aiming to stir the pot. He expected his comment to get a reaction, but the other members of the Werewolf Mecha squad didn’t even bother to acknowledge him.\nWhen his words were met with silence, Kares’s expression darkened. He shot a glare at the pureblood merman, signaling for backup.\nThe pureblood merman, who was busy enjoying his food, shivered under Kares’s stare. Though he hadn’t caught much of what Kares said, he knew from experience that agreeing was his safest move. So, he quickly nodded and added, \"Oh, yes, exactly.\"\nHis spineless reply earned him a collective eye roll from the rest of the Werewolf Mecha squad, who silently decided to pretend both Kares and the merman didn’t exist.\nThe mermen couldn’t care less about the drama brewing between the Alliance and Werewolf squads.\nTo them, all this plotting and scheming was just a waste of energy. They figured their time was better spent charming beautiful women and thinking about future generations.\nConfident in their strength, they didn’t see the point in getting tangled up in complicated tactics.\nOn the flip side, the Kraiton Empire’s team wasn’t nearly as relaxed. Instead of focusing on the upcoming competition, they were secretly fretting over Arix.\n\"Captain, we’ve got a situation! There’s some pretty boy sitting next to Arix, and it looks like they’re engaged,\" Liron reported, clearly stressed out. Their main goal—besides winning, of course—was to lure Arix into joining the Kraiton Empire.\nAnd what’s the best way to win someone over? Romance, naturally!\nIf they could pull it off, it would mean a major promotion for whoever succeeded and a huge win for their nation. But with Arix already having a fiance, their grand plan seemed to be falling apart before it even started.\n\"Oh, I see. And then?\" The man who responded had a face more beautiful than most women, his laid-back demeanor making him seem entirely unthreatening.\n\"What do you mean, ’and then’! Captain, come on, get your head in the game! They’re not married yet, so there’s still a shot. With a bit of effort, you can break up any couple!\" Liron was fully convinced that once his captain made a move, Arix wouldn’t stand a chance.\n\"Okay, fine. Maybe next time,\" Branson replied casually. He yawned, cradling his equally lazy Psychic Incarnation, and settled in for a nap on the couch.\nLiron just stared, speechless.\n’How did I end up with such a useless captain?’\nAs Branson drifted off, Liron couldn’t help but feel like this whole squad was hopeless without him.",

      "content": "Chapter 253: Cassian Won\nWithout anyone really noticing, the party was winding down.\nCassian stuck around with Arix for a bit longer, not quite ready to say goodbye. Eventually, he said his farewells to the Alliance mecha team and headed back to his own group.\nAfter seeing him off, the Alliance team started making their own exit. They thanked the Empire of Eden, who had hosted the event, and prepared to return to the hotel.\nArix was the last to leave. Just as she crossed the threshold, her opticomputer chimed.\nCurious, she opened the message and read it, feeling a bit surprised. After a moment, she quickly ran over to Drexel and said, \"I need to step out for a bit. Don’t wait up; I’ll come back on my own.\"\nDrexel frowned, obviously concerned. \"What could you possibly have to do at this hour? You hardly know anyone here.\"\n\"It’s fine. It’s just a friend who wants to chat for a bit. I won’t be long,\" Arix reassured him.\nBut Drexel didn’t trust anyone wanting to meet his sister so late. Just as he was about to protest, Arix had already taken off.\n\"Don’t worry, Drexel! It’s someone I know well. I’ll be back in half an hour,\" she called out, waving as she disappeared down the hallway.\nDrexel puffed up his cheeks in frustration but kept quiet. After giving some instructions to his teammates, he leaned against the wall, checking the time every few minutes as he waited for Arix.\nMeanwhile, Arix arrived at the spot mentioned in the message. She scanned the area and spotted someone leaning against the railing.\n\"Scion,\" she called out with a smile as she approached.\n\"You made it,\" Scion replied, his rare smile softening his usually serious expression.\n\"Yeah, I’m here. So, what’s up?\" Arix leaned against the railing too, turning to look at him with curiosity. She couldn’t help but notice, once again, how good-looking Scion was.\nScion nodded, his voice tinged with concern. \"Are you taking part in the match the day after tomorrow?\"\n\"Of course! I’m one of the main players,\" Arix responded with pride.\nBut Scion’s frown deepened. \"Arix, in previous mecha tournaments, at least one-fifth of the participants didn’t make it out alive. Are you sure you want to go through with this?\" he asked, clearly worried.\nHe didn’t want her facing such danger.\n\"We’ve been warned about the risks, Scion. But I’m ready for it. Don’t you trust my skills?\" Arix said, her smile full of confidence.\nScion sighed, realizing he couldn’t change her mind. \"Do you really have to compete?\"\n\"Yes. Drexel’s in it too. I can’t just back out now,\" Arix explained. While she had her reasons for wanting to participate, a big part of it was keeping an eye on Drexel. He was so reckless that she couldn’t relax unless she was there with him.\n\"Alright, but if things get too dangerous out there, promise me you’ll pull out. Don’t worry about the rankings,\" Scion urged, his concern still evident.\n\"Got it, I’m not reckless,\" Arix assured him with a firm nod.\nSeeing her determination, Scion fell silent. After a pause, he looked up at the night sky and asked, almost casually, \"Arix, I heard you’re getting engaged to Cassian?\"\nArix blinked in surprise, not expecting that. But after a moment of thought, she replied seriously, \"Yes, we’re planning the engagement after the tournament.\"\n\"Do you love him?\" Scion’s voice was calm, but his eyes held a complicated mix of emotions.\n\"Yes, I do,\" Arix answered without a second thought.\nScion’s fingers tensed for a moment before he relaxed and reached out, gently ruffling Arix’s hair. \"Is that so... But you’re still young. Do you really understand what it means to love someone?\"\nArix blinked, then rested her chin in her hand, gazing up at the moon. \"I think I do. Cassian will be my mate for life. We’ll grow old and wrinkly together, probably lose our teeth, and eventually rest side by side among the stars. I don’t dislike that idea. Maybe that’s what it means to like someone.\"\nScion listened to her words, a pang of bitterness settling in his chest. A wave of unexpected jealousy washed over him as he realized how much he wished he could be in Cassian’s place.\nAfter a long pause, he forced a smile, as if finally accepting something within himself. \"Then I’m glad, Arix. Just make sure you’re happy with him.\"\n\"Thanks, Scion,\" Arix replied, her smile as bright as the moon above them.\nThey talked a bit longer, but eventually, Arix glanced at the time and decided it was time to leave.\nAs she walked away, Scion watched her go, the smile fading from his face, replaced by a melancholy expression. The hope he had silently nurtured had come too late.\nLooking up at the moon, Scion let out a soft sigh, a bitter smile tugging at his lips as he murmured to himself, \"Cassian, looks like I’ve lost.\"\nWith those words, the feelings he had never voiced began to retreat, locking themselves away deep inside his heart.\nAs Arix reached the entrance of the banquet hall, ready to head back on her own, she suddenly heard Drexel’s voice calling out to her.\n\"Arix, over here!\" Drexel waved, a smile on his face.\n\"Drexel!\" Arix exclaimed, her face lighting up as she ran over and jumped onto his back.\n\"Not bad, waiting up for me,\" Arix teased.\n\"If I lost you, Mom and Dad would skin me alive,\" Drexel said warmly as he carried her, heading toward the ship’s docking point.\nArix giggled, feeling content.\nAs the night deepened, the two slowly faded into the distance, their laughter echoing softly in the cool night air.\n...\nThe day of the competition arrived.\nEarly that morning, all the teams gathered in the plaza outside the hotel.\nThe members of the five teams present exchanged quick, assessing glances at one another.\nAfter sizing each other up, they returned to their teams, waiting for the warship that would transport them to the competition site.\nIt wasn’t that they didn’t want to study their opponents more closely, but every move they made was under heavy scrutiny.\nA thick crowd of spectators surrounded the hotel, making it impossible to move freely.\nOn top of that, authorized media swarmed around the teams, broadcasting live to a captivated audience.\n\"Good morning, viewers! I’m your host, Phil,\" announced the journalist, drawing out his words to build suspense. \"Today, we’re covering the annual Newcomers’ Mecha Tournament. But before the competition kicks off, I’m hoping to interview a few participants and get their thoughts. So, who should we start with?\"\nAs expected, the livestream chat immediately lit up with suggestions from eager viewers, each rooting for their favorite contestant.\n[MechaManiac]: \"It’s gotta be Shedd from the Empire of Eden! I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again—Shedd is the best! Shedd all the way!\"\n[MermanFanatic]: \"Forget that! Start with Prince Kaleb from the Empire of Merman! He’s the only pureblood merman we’ve seen in years!\"\n[SnackTime]: \"No way! Prince Branson from Kraiton should be first. If you haven’t seen his looks, you’re seriously missing out!\"\n[IceQueen]: \"Please! If we’re talking about looks, Prince Cassian should definitely be the first one interviewed!\"\n[ArixSuperfan]: \"Looks don’t matter! Let’s focus on talent! The host better pick Arix, or I’m gonna be seriously upset!\"\nAs the chat continued to blow up, Phil’s excitement grew.",

      "content": "Chapter 254: Master Sophia\nThis level of buzz was every journalist’s dream.\nRiding the wave of enthusiasm, Phil grinned and announced, \"Since everyone’s opinions are so divided, let’s settle this with a vote! If you’re rooting for Blaze, press 1! For Prince Kaleb, press 2! For Prince Branson, press 3! For Prince Cassian, press 4! And if you want Arix, press 5! Ready? We’ll start the countdown from three!\"\n[MermanKing]: \"If you’ve got good taste, it’s gotta be 5!\"\n[Cassian4Life]: \"4444! Vote for Prince Cassian! He’s the real deal!\"\n[ThirstyForBranson]: \"I’m all in for 1.\"\n[SpaceTraveler]: \"Arix doesn’t go public often! It’s got to be 5!\"\n[UncleJoe]: \"You know what, I’m voting 5 too. Arix’s psychic power potion saved me last year!\"\n[HakimLover]: \"+1 for Arix!\"\nAs the countdown wrapped up, Phil watched as the screen was flooded with 5s. He raised an eyebrow, impressed by the overwhelming support for Arix. But, ever the professional, he quickly regained his composure, flashing a playful smile. \"Well, it looks like the majority have spoken! Our first interview will be with Arix!\"\nWith that, Phil headed over to get the scoop, ready to kick off the day with an exclusive chat with the fan-favorite.\nThe five mecha teams were already standing close together, so it didn’t take Phil long to reach Arix.\nHe approached her with a polite smile, maintaining a respectful distance as he extended the microphone toward her. \"Arix, congrats on being the first to be interviewed. How confident are you feeling about the upcoming competition?\"\nArix wasn’t expecting to be put on the spot like this and felt a bit shy under the teasing gazes of her teammates. But knowing this was a live broadcast across the galaxy, she reminded herself that she represented the Alliance and had to make a strong impression.\nShe brushed her bangs behind her ear, revealing her strikingly beautiful face, and flashed a confident smile at the camera. \"I’m feeling confident, and that confidence comes from my teammates. They’re my rock.\"\nArix’s natural beauty, combined with her poised response, left many of the livestream viewers completely captivated. The chat exploded with excitement.\n**[MechaLover24]:** \"Oh my gosh, Arix is so adorable! I’m totally in love!\"\n**[StarGazer99]:** \"Arix just gets prettier every day! When’s the wedding, Arix? I’m ready!\"\n**[GoddessFan]:** \"No wonder she’s our queen! Go, Arix! The championship is yours!\"\nEven though the chat was overflowing with positive reactions, Phil wasn’t entirely satisfied with such a straightforward answer. With a twinkle of mischief in his eye, he pressed on, \"Arix, who do you think is the strongest competitor in this tournament?\"\nArix hesitated for a split second, caught off guard by the question. That question just put her in a difficult position.\nIf she complimented someone else, it could be seen as downplaying her own team’s abilities. On the other hand, claiming her own team as the strongest might come off as arrogant. It was a tricky situation.\nBut Arix, having dealt with her brother Drexel’s teasing for years, was quick on her feet. She put on an innocent expression, her wide eyes sparkling with sincerity. \"The strongest? That has to be my brother, Drexel. Without his care and love, I wouldn’t have made it to this place.\"\nHer answer was both clever and endearing, sidestepping the potential trap without offending anyone. It was hard to argue with the sentiment that a big brother is the strongest in his sister’s eyes.\nPhil, caught off guard by her response, raised his eyebrows in mild surprise. He attempted a few more tricky questions, but each time, Arix skillfully deflected them, much to the amusement of the viewers.\nEventually, even the audience began chiming in on the chat, playfully urging Phil to give up. Realizing he wasn’t going to trip her up, Phil finally conceded, albeit with a hint of regret.\nOnce she was done with the interview, Arix breathed a sigh of relief. The journalist, though friendly, had clearly enjoyed testing her.\nJust as she was catching her breath, the warships from the five countries arrived at the hotel, prompting a shift in the atmosphere.\nThe reporters were pushed back, no longer allowed to approach the participants directly.\nHowever, the nano-cameras continued to capture every moment, ensuring the live broadcast kept rolling.\nWith the warships’ arrival, everyone in the plaza began to prepare for departure.\nThe mecha team members exchanged a few final glances, each silently sizing up the competition one last time before boarding their respective ships.\nThe time had come to head to the competition site, and the excitement in the air was palpable.\nOn the Alliance battleship, Sykes stood with a serious expression as he addressed everyone before the competition began. \"The battleground has been chosen—Inferno. This planet is swarming with fallen beasts, and the air is filled with an unknown virus that leads to mental breakdowns. Your primary mission will likely involve dealing with this virus, but remember, your safety is the top priority. If things get too intense, don’t hesitate to quit the competition. I’ll pull you out immediately. Got it?\"\nThe entire Alliance mecha team saluted sharply and replied in unison, \"Yes, sir!\"\nSatisfied, Sykes nodded. \"Good. I won’t keep you any longer. Double-check your gear before the competition. Dismissed.\"\nWith that, he turned and left the room, leaving the space to the students.\n\"Arix, Varden, do you have enough medical supplies?\" Zephyr asked as he approached them.\nArix and Varden exchanged a quick look before nodding confidently at Zephyr. \"Sir, we’re fully stocked.\"\n\"Great,\" Zephyr acknowledged with a nod, then moved on to check in with the others.\nOnce Zephyr was gone, Arix and Varden got to work on their gear.\nArix retrieved her Star Dust mecha and climbed into the cockpit to run diagnostics on various systems. Just to be sure, she also called on Sophia for assistance.\n\"Arix, the mecha’s systems are in good shape, but the energy stone is running low. You should swap it out for a fresh one,\" Sophia advised.\n\"Got it,\" Arix agreed without a second thought, promptly replacing the old energy stone in the mecha’s compartment.\nCirilla, who had been observing Sophia’s inspection, chimed in, \"Arix, do you think Sophia could check my mecha too?\"\nArix paused, glancing at Sophia. After getting a nod of approval, she turned back to Cirilla. \"Sure, no problem.\"\n\"Awesome! Thanks, Sophia,\" Cirilla said with a grateful smile as she quickly brought out her own mecha.\nSophia nodded with a touch of pride and then got down to business, carefully inspecting Cirilla’s mecha.\nWhile mechas used in competitions are typically well-maintained, Cirilla was surprised when Sophia discovered several issues within minutes.\n\"This wire is worn out—better to replace it. And this screw has a small crack. You should also apply some lubricant here,\" Sophia pointed out patiently.\nCirilla had only a small hope for Sophia to find anything, so she was stunned when everything turned out to be exactly as he said. She hurried to make the adjustments, her surprise growing with each fix.\nSwallowing nervously, Cirilla looked at Arix in awe. \"Arix, is your Psychic Incarnation really this skilled? It’s like having a mecha Grandmaster on your team!\"\nArix felt it was a bit of a stretch but still nodded. \"Sophia definitely knows more about mechas than I do.\"\nHearing this, Cirilla gasped in disbelief.\n’If Sophia is even more skilled than Arix, just how incredible is this Psychic Incarnation?’\nWhile Cirilla was still processing this, Arix was already used to it.\nSophia had a passion for everything related to mechas, constantly reading and watching anything she could find on the subject. She’d even pored over Arix’s mecha notes more than anyone else.\nSophia might not officially be a Grandmaster yet, but he was definitely on the brink of it.\nWhen the rest of the Alliance mecha team saw that Sophia had really found issues with Cirilla’s mecha, they eagerly lined up, asking him to check theirs as well.\nKnowing these were Arix’s teammates, Sophia didn’t hesitate and agreed without any fuss.\nOver the next while, Sophia meticulously inspected each person’s mecha. If there was a problem, she spotted it right away. Even when the mecha was in perfect condition, Sophia still offered valuable tips for improvement.\nHer expertise and sharp eye quickly earned the respect of the entire team. By the end, they weren’t just calling him \"Sophia\" anymore—they were respectfully addressing him as \"Master Sophia.\"\nWatching Sophia win over her teammates, Arix stood to the side, a proud and affectionate smile on her face. There was nothing more rewarding than seeing someone you care about shine.\nBut the moment of pride didn’t last long.\nSuddenly, Sophia’s expression shifted to one of deep concern, and he called out, \"Arix, come over here.\"\nArix had never seen Sophia so serious before, and a sense of unease immediately washed over her.\nWith a slight frown, she quickly walked over and glanced at the mecha Sophia was inspecting.\nHer voice tinged with worry, she asked, \"Sophia, what’s wrong? Did you find something?\"\nThe small tiger cub, her face grave, nodded and said, \"Arix, check this mecha yourself. See if you can identify the issue.\"\nWithout a second thought, Arix activated her psychic power and began a thorough inspection of the mecha, scanning it from top to bottom.\nThe others, who had been watching from the sidelines, started to grow uneasy as well.\nThey knew how skilled Sophia was, having witnessed it firsthand. If she was this serious, something had to be very wrong.\nAs the tension grew, everyone’s eyes slowly turned toward their captain, Zephyr—the owner of the mecha in question.",

      "content": "Chapter 255: Drexel’s Other Side\nZephyr felt an unsettling shift in the air. His fists tightened with barely controlled rage, and the look in his eyes was downright chilling. People could almost feel the sharp edge of his anger.\nBut it wasn’t because someone was after him—he could handle that. What really got under his skin was the fact that someone was willing to mess with the Alliance’s success for their own shady reasons.\nDrexel and Elio exchanged a quick, tense glance, both clearly aware of something they weren’t sharing. But no one dared to speak just yet.\nAll eyes were glued to Arix as she carefully inspected the mecha, everyone holding their breath.\nAfter about ten agonizing minutes, Arix finally stopped. She turned to the mecha’s head, her face clouded with uncertainty.\n\"Drexel, is there really an issue?\" Drexel’s voice wavered, his concern for Zephyr evident. If something was wrong, Drexel wasn’t about to let it slide.\nArix struggled to find the right words. Nothing obvious was wrong, yet she had this unshakable feeling that something was seriously off—something that could be deadly.\n’How come that I can’t pinpoint it?’\nShe shook her head at Drexel before turning to the small tiger cub nearby. \"Sophia, is there anything wrong with the head?\"\nSophia gave a solemn nod and then directed her gaze at the mecha’s owner. \"Someone tampered with the head of this mecha. If it triggers during battle, you might not make it out alive. And they’ve set it up so that your death would seem like just another unfortunate accident—no signs of foul play.\"\nA collective shiver ran through the Alliance’s mecha squad.\nSure, accidents in battle were all too common, especially in the high-stakes competitions they were involved in, where the odds of survival weren’t great to begin with. But the idea that someone had sabotaged a mecha to ensure Zephyr’s death—that took malice to a whole new level.\n\"Who would be vile enough to scheme like this during a competition?\" Cirilla’s voice trembled with fury, her eyes practically blazing.\n\"I’ve already contacted Admiral Sykes. This is more than just a simple case of sabotage,\" Varden said, maintaining his composure, though he was deeply concerned. He had immediately reached out to someone who could take control of the situation.\nElio looked like he wanted to say something but held back, instead turning his gaze to Zephyr.\nAfter all, it was Zephyr’s life on the line, so the decision was his to make.\nZephyr, unlike the others who were brimming with righteous anger, remained unnervingly calm. Maybe he’d been through this kind of thing too many times before.\n\"Sophia, can you remove it? And will it mess with the match?\" Zephyr asked, his voice steady, eyes calm.\nSophia shook her head, looking regretful. \"I can do it, but it’ll take at least three hours. You wouldn’t have time to compete.\"\nZephyr’s hands clenched even tighter. His knuckles turned white, standing out like sharp peaks. He finally closed his eyes, drawing in a deep, steadying breath.\nWhen he opened them again, he turned to Drexel. \"You’ll have to take charge in this match. Can you handle it?\"\nDrexel hesitated, his brow furrowed as he glanced at Arix, hoping she might pull a last-minute miracle.\nArix caught his look but could only offer an apologetic shake of her head. \"I’m sorry. I can’t even figure out what it is, let alone fix it.\"\nSeeing no other option, Drexel let out a heavy sigh and turned to Zephyr, nodding firmly. \"Alright, I’ve got this match covered.\"\nWith the competition right around the corner, there was no time for second thoughts.\n\"I know you do,\" Zephyr said, offering a rare, slight smile. Then he turned his attention to the three reserve members standing nearby.\nHe studied them closely, his eyes finally landing on Quinnie. \"Quinnie, I’m counting on you this time.\"\nQuispe was caught off guard. He hadn’t expected to be chosen, especially not like this, but he wasn’t about to let the opportunity slip through his fingers. With a quick nod, he accepted the responsibility.\nWith the team lineup finalized, Zephyr gave Drexel one last nod and then made his way over to Sykes, who had just arrived, looking anxious.\nOnce Zephyr was gone, Elio approached Drexel, his face shadowed with concern. \"Drexel, this has the old man from the Calix family written all over it, doesn’t it?\"\n\"I can’t say for certain,\" Drexel replied, his eyes narrowing in thought. \"But there’s no one else who wants Zephyr out of the picture more than the head of the Calix family.\"\n\"The emergence of the Psychic Ware must have reignited his ambitions. And with his son awakening a Psychic Incarnation too, it’s no wonder he’s so desperate to eliminate Zephyr,\" Elio added, his voice dripping with cold disdain.\n\"Whatever you do, don’t let my sister hear about this. I don’t want her feeling any guilt over the Psychic Ware thing,\" Drexel said, his expression tightening.\nElio paused, taken aback. \"You’re underestimating her, Drexel. She’s stronger than you think.\"\n\"I know,\" Drexel admitted, his tone softening as he thought of his sister. \"But I still don’t want these ugly things tainting her view of the world.\"\nElio rolled his eyes, unable to help himself. Then, with a smirk, he threw an arm around Drexel’s shoulders, his voice turning playful. \"Fine, we’ll keep it from her. But we still need to figure out how to deal with that Calix family head.\"\nDrexel pushed Elio away, his expression turning serious. \"The head of the Calix family will face justice through the military court. It’s not our place to interfere.\"\nElio raised an eyebrow, thinking how easy it was for Drexel to say that. He remembered the last time someone crossed the line—the way Drexel dealt with the imposter pretending to be Arix. The so-called trial was hardly impartial, and the outcome had been brutal.\nThe memory of \"Raya\" being tortured until she was barely recognizable sent a shiver down Elio’s spine.\n’Of all the people to anger, they had to pick this sister-obsessed maniac?’\nElio sighed.\n’God help them. Maybe next time around, they’ll make better choices.’\n...\nDespite a slight hiccup along the way, the warship carrying the Alliance mecha team finally made it to the competition site without any major issues.\nFive warships, each representing a different nation, all docked at the same time on the Empire of Eden’s massive starship carrier. As the doors opened, the mecha teams from each country stepped out in neat formations.\nNano-cameras, which had been waiting for this exact moment, sprang into action, buzzing around the five teams. These cameras captured everything, broadcasting the event live across the interstellar network with perfect clarity.\nAll around the galaxy, people tuned in to watch.\nThe Kering family on Hecaris, the Leonidas couple in the Empire, and even the orphans on Planet Waste were all gathered in front of screens, eagerly following the live broadcast.\nFleur, clearly nervous, leaned into Thaddeus, her eyes fixed on the screen as their two children appeared.\nThaddeus gave her shoulder a reassuring pat before turning his own gaze to the broadcast, his expression calm but watchful.\nAt the orphanage on Planet Waste...\n\"Look! Sister Gwen, I see Arix!\"\n\"I see her too! Go Arix!\"\n\"Arix is the best, no doubt!\"\nSister Gwen smiled warmly as the children’s excited whispers filled the room. She turned her attention to the broadcast, silently cheering, \"Go, Arix.\"\nAt the the Empire of Sacred Moonlight’s royal palace...\nLuna Amethyst watched the live feed, her face etched with displeasure as Cassian appeared on screen. \"What’s that silly boy doing just standing there? He should at least say hi to Arix!\"\nAlpha Leonidas chuckled softly at his wife’s comment before explaining, \"Honey, Cassian’s the team leader. He needs to stay focused and lead the team.\"\n\"It’s just a small competition. Is that really more important than greeting his wife?\" Luna Amethyst’s tone dripped with disdain, as if Cassian wasn’t even her own child.\nAlpha Leonidas, unfazed by his wife’s grumbling, joined in, \"Cassian’s nothing like I was.\"\nLuna Amethyst shot her husband a long look but chose not to say anything more.",

      "content": "Chapter 256: The Competition Kicks Off\nOn Planet Inferno...\nThe minister of the Empire of Eden, who had been waiting on-site, stepped forward to greet everyone as soon as the teams arrived.\nAfter warmly exchanging greetings with the admirals from the five nations, he invited them to take their places on the main platform.\nWith the five admirals and the minister seated, making up a panel of six judges, the head referee of the competition took center stage.\nAddressing the five mecha teams below, he began, \"Welcome to the 96th New Mecha Tournament. I’ll now explain the rules.\"\n\"This competition will take place here on Inferno and last for 15 days. The scoring system is based on points: the higher your points, the better your team’s ranking.\"\n\"Points can be earned by killing beasts, each worth one point. Another key factor is the survival of your teammates. Each surviving member at the end of 15 days earns your team 100 points, meaning ten survivors will add 1,000 points to your total.\"\n\"Lastly, solving the unknown virus will earn you the highest score possible in this competition—10,000 points!\" The referee’s voice rose as he finished, hyping up the mood even more.\n10,000 points meant one thing: no matter how the five mecha teams performed overall, solving the unknown virus could completely flip the standings and secure an unexpected victory.\nThis realization sparked a fire in everyone’s eyes—both the speaker and the listeners.\nArix, standing below, felt a surge of adrenaline, her excitement bubbling over as she imagined racing to Inferno to tackle the virus head-on.\nEven those who weren’t experts in virus research couldn’t help but feel a restless energy.\nIt was like a gambler’s thrill, knowing the odds were slim but still feeling that slight chance gnawing away at their rational thoughts.\nThere was no doubt about it—this referee knew how to ignite a crowd. His words didn’t just motivate; they set hearts ablaze.\nAs the anticipation in the air reached its peak, the head referee didn’t drag it out any longer. He announced, \"The rules are set. The competition begins in three minutes. Get ready!\"\nRight after he spoke, a three-minute countdown appeared midair.\nWithout wasting a second, the competitors swiftly brought out their mechas, each one slipping efficiently into their cockpits.\n\"Everyone, prepare to enter Inferno!\" Drexel’s calm and steady voice came through the wireless earpieces.\n\"Understood!\" The team responded in unison, their voices strong and resolute.\nThe Alliance mecha team powered up their machines and moved to the edge of the starship carrier.\nAs the countdown hit the final second, they leaped off without a moment’s hesitation.\nThey shot through the void of space, breaking through the planet’s atmosphere, and descended into a world shrouded in gray.\nTheir arrival shattered the long-standing silence of Inferno.\nIn an instant, countless pairs of massive, glowing red eyes flickered to life all around them.\n\"Roar!\"\nThe Fallen Beasts, roused by the disturbance, let out bloodthirsty roars of fury.\nWithout a moment’s delay, they lunged at the new arrivals, seeing them as easy prey delivered right to their doorstep.\n...\nThe six referees were all focused on the live broadcast screens in front of them.\nThe screen was divided into 50 frames, each showing a different contestant competing. When a judge noticed a particularly impressive contestant, they would enlarge that frame to observe more closely.\n\"The contestants this year are quite impressive. Each one is a genius,\" the minister of the Empire of Eden said with a satisfied smile after watching for a while.\n\"That’s not entirely a good thing. In the past, we were lucky to find one genius. This year, there are so many it’s almost troublesome,\" Admiral Crude of the Empire of Eden said with a complicated expression.\n\"When something unusual happens, there’s often trouble brewing. I fear things won’t stay peaceful for long,\" Sykes, who had lived most of his life, said, clearly sensing something.\nEven Scion, who was usually emotionless, had a serious look in his eyes. It was uncertain how long this calm could last.\nIn contrast to the four who were worried, the other two admirals seemed unconcerned.\n\"You’re overthinking this. It’s not that mysterious,\" Admiral Roland of the Empire of Kraiton said lazily, leaning back in his chair and rolling his eyes.\n\"I agree. You’ve seen so much as an admiral, yet you still cling to old superstitions,\" Admiral Kaser of the Empire of Merman scoffed.\nSykes glanced at the two of them, too tired to argue. It wasn’t that he was timid, but these two had extreme personalities: one didn’t care about anything, and the other dismissed everything. Arguing with them would only make Sykes himself angry.\n\"Better to believe than not. I trust my own intinctions on battlefields, and it works every time,\" Admiral Crude tried to persuade the two.\nUnfortunately, his good advice falls on deaf ears. Admiral Roland and Admiral Kaiser didn’t take him seriously, even finding him annoying.\nSeeing the tension rise, the minister of the Empire of Eden quickly stepped in to smooth things over. \"Alright, alright, the competition is starting. Let’s see how the kids perform.\"\nThe five admirals agreed, as they were also curious about the strength of these young contestants.\n...\nArix landed on Inferno with her mecha, Star Dust, and she immediately felt uncomfortable. She couldn’t quite describe the feeling. She just shook her head and pushed the feeling aside, focusing on her surroundings.\nInferno had once been a tourist paradise, but after an unknown virus outbreak, the once-thriving cities were now nothing but ruins.\nEven the air, which should have been fresh and sweet, was now filled with a toxic stench.\nArix glanced at the city, now overrun with dead plants and crumbling buildings. Her attention then shifted to the Fallen Beasts slowly surrounding them. These beasts were huge, filthy, and their blood-red eyes stared hungrily at the group, drooling.\nArix’s expression grew serious as her mecha’s fingers tightened around the sword. She took a defensive stance.\n\"Drexel, should we fight?\" Elio asked in the mech channel, holding a massive sword he had bought for 1 billion astrocredits.\nDrexel looked at the Fallen Beasts around them.\nThere weren’t too many, and they wouldn’t be hard to deal with, so he nodded. \"Yes, let’s kill them all.\"\n\"Got it.\" Elio grinned and moved towards the Fallen Beasts, sharpening his blade.\nThe others, seeing this, also raised their weapons and began to attack.\nArix just knocked down a Fallen Beast and ready to deliver the finishing blow. But as she moved in, something strange happened. She accidentally locked eyes with the beast’s pupil, and suddenly, her mind was flooded with chaotic voices.\n\"It hurts... it hurts so much...\"\n\"Dad... Mom...\"\n\"Save me... save... me...\"\nShaking her head, Arix tried to push away the confusion and refocus.\nShe stared at the Fallen Beast, stunned.\n’Is this some kind of illusion? Or are these beasts really crying out for help?’\nThe thought froze her in place.\n’We’re slaughtering them now, but what if these creatures can actually be saved?’\n\"Arix, what’s going on? Are you hurt?\" Drexel’s voice cut through her thoughts.\nHe had noticed her standing still, just staring at the Fallen Beast, not reacting. His concern was clear.\n\"Nothing, I’m okay,\" Arix quickly reassured him, snapping out of her daze. But her mind was still racing. She reached out mentally to Sylvana, asking, \"Sylvana, are you there?\"\n\"I’m here, Arix. I’m guessing you want to ask about these Fallen Beasts?\" Sylvana responded, as if she had already anticipated the question.\n\"Yes, I need to know if they can be saved,\" Arix asked, her voice tinged with nervousness.\nThere was a pause, as if Sylvana was weighing her answer carefully. \"They can be saved, but it’s incredibly difficult.\"\nThe difficulty didn’t matter to Arix at that moment. Just knowing that they could be saved left her shocked. It meant that every Fallen Beast on this planet had the potential to be rescued. Yet here they were, their lives reduced to nothing more than points in a competition.\nThe weight of that realization hit her hard.",

      "content": "Chapter 257: Saving The Beasts\n\"Oh no, what have we done?\" Arix’s eyes widened in sheer panic.\nRegret didn’t even have time to sink in. She quickly spoke into the mecha channel, her voice tight with anxiety, \"Wait, hold on! Don’t kill these Fallen Beasts just yet.\"\nThe rest of the mecha team caught her urgent tone. Although confused, they halted their attacks and switched to defensive positions.\n\"Arix, what’s going on?\" Drexel asked, his voice puzzled over the channel.\nArix didn’t answer immediately. She first listened to Sylvana’s explanation, then, with a heavy heart, finally spoke to the team, \"These Fallen Beasts...they’re actually Celesterrors. They’ve been infected by some virus that turned them into Fallen Beasts. If we can find a cure, we might be able to save them.\"\nA stunned silence fell over the entire team. They stared at their bloodied weapons and the carnage around them, struggling to process the truth. The creatures they’d been slaughtering weren’t just wild beasts—they were Celesterrors, a species they’d considered allies.\nThe Celesterrors were intelligent, on par with humans, and realizing what they’d done hit hard. It felt like a massacre.\n\"Damn it, the Empire of Eden never told us these were Celesterrors!\" Cirilla spat out, her anger barely contained as she considered smashing the competition point.\nThe Celesterrors weren’t just protected by the Alliance; they were friends—especially to Cirilla, who had close ties with the Celesterror Lord. The betrayal cut deep.\n\"The organizers probably didn’t even consider these sick Fallen Beasts to be Celesterror anymore,\" Varden added with a cold sneer.\n\"So what do we do now? Do we just quit? I thought they were just beasts, but knowing they’re Celesterror...I can’t keep fighting,\" Elio said, his voice pained.\n\"Arix, is there a way to save these Fallen—no, Celesterror?\" Drexel asked, cutting straight to the heart of the matter.\nArix nodded, then hesitated, \"I think so, but I can’t promise it’ll work. I can only try my best.\"\n\"How confident are you? What are the odds?\" Drexel pressed.\n\"Maybe forty percent. But if we can get our hands on the original virus strain, I might push that to sixty,\" Arix estimated after thinking it over.\n\"Got it,\" Drexel said, his eyes narrowing with determination. He pressed his headset, his voice firm as he commanded, \"Given the situation, we’re changing our mission. Our new objective is not to rack up points by killing Fallen Beasts. We’re going to solve this virus and save every Celesterror on this planet! Team, are you with me?\"\nThe squad exchanged determined looks before turning back to Drexel. In unison, they answered, \"We’re with you!\"\n\"Excellent! Here’s the plan: Cirilla, Elio, Marceau, Deanna—you’ll contact the other mecha teams. Fill them in on the situation. If they want to join us, great. If not, no pressure; just head back to base immediately,\" Drexel ordered, his tone serious.\n\"Understood!\" the other four responded in unison.\nThey quickly maneuvered their mechas in different directions, nodding to each other in reassurance before splitting off.\nWith his team members dispatched, Drexel continued, \"Lydia, Marco, Quinnie, and I will head to Inferno’s capital to find that virus strain. Protect Arix and Varden with everything you’ve got.\"\n\"Understood!\" the three replied quickly.\nAfter giving everyone their tasks, Drexel turned to Arix and Varden, his expression serious. \"The virus situation is in your hands,\" he said solemnly.\n\"I’ll do my best!\" Arix replied, her voice steady with determination.\n\"Don’t worry,\" Varden added with a firm nod.\n\"Alright, let’s move out!\" Drexel commanded, leading the way.\nThe rest of the team quickly followed, but Quinnie lingered for just a moment, her eyes flickering with thought. She tapped her screen three times, a decision made.\n...\nSince there was no audio, viewers in the livestreaming channel were left baffled as they watched the Alliance mecha squad.\nThey couldn’t understand why a team that had been fighting so fiercely suddenly started splitting up and retreating. It looked as if they couldn’t handle the Fallen Beasts anymore.\nThis sudden shift in behavior sparked a wave of mockery and frustration among viewers in the chat.\nZombieResurrected:\n\"The Alliance mecha squad is so weak! They can’t even handle a few Fallen Beasts. What a disgrace to the entire galaxy!\"\nTruthHurts:\n\"Yeah, what are they doing? If they’re not going to kill Fallen Beasts for points, why even join the competition?!\"\nWowCrazyGoddess:\n\"I think they must have a reason for this. Maybe there’s something we don’t know.\"\nAngry comments flooded the screen. Even when a few viewers tried to defend the team, their messages were quickly buried under a barrage of criticism from trolls, who were more interested in ridiculing than understanding.\nUnlike the silent chatter on the interstellarnet, the live streams for the six referees picked up all the sounds at the competition site. This meant the refs clearly heard what was going down with the Alliance’s mecha team.\nWhen they realized that the Fallen Beasts were actually Celesterrors, all five referees immediately turned their attention to the minister of the Empire of Eden.\nAdmiral Crude managed to keep his cool, showing only a slight hesitation before sighing and shaking his head. He chose to stay quiet. But the admirals from the other four nations weren’t as restrained.\nEven the typically unreliable Admiral Kaser from the Empire of Merman had a mocking look in his eyes. As for the other three countries, where Celesterrors were still a protected species, their reactions were even colder.\nAdmiral Sykes was the first to break the silence, his expression darkening. He said to the minister of Eden, \"Sir, it appears that when you chose this competition site, you neglected to inform us that these Fallen Beasts were actually Celesterrors. I expect a reasonable explanation from you, or I will have to suspect that the Empire of Eden is intentionally provoking the Alliance.\"\nAdmiral Roland, straightening up, spoke in a casual tone, but his eyes were razor-sharp. \"I think everyone in the galaxy is aware of the close ties between the Empire of Kraiton and the Celesterrors. Please don’t try to tell us you didn’t know, minister.\"\nScion stayed silent, but the cold scrutiny in his gaze spoke volumes, making anyone in the room squirm.\nThe minister of Eden wasn’t easily intimidated, but under the intense stares of the admirals, he swallowed nervously before trying to put on a calm face. Awkwardly, he began, \"Gentlemen, there’s been a misunderstanding. Please allow me to explain.\"\nThough the admirals didn’t say a word, the icy tension in the room made it clear they were expecting a solid explanation. If he didn’t deliver, they wouldn’t hesitate to take action.\nThis blatant disregard for his authority made the minister furious, but he knew better than to push back too hard.\nAfter a moment of internal struggle, he put on a sorrowful expression and said, \"It’s really not our fault. The Empire of Eden had no choice but to select Inferno as the competition site.\"\nBefore he could continue his performance, Sykes cut him off. \"Oh really, and then what happened?\" Sykes stared at him with an expressionless face, his eyes practically mocking him, as if daring him to spin more lies.\nSeeing that he wasn’t going to fool these seasoned veterans, the minister gave up and came clean. \"This really isn’t our fault, and the Elden can’t be blamed for what happened. It all started back when Inferno was still a tourist destination.\"\nThis freew(e)bnovel.(c)om",

      "content": "Chapter 258: Different Choices\nIn the beginning, Inferno wasn’t the polluted mess it is now. It was once the most popular tourist planet in the Empire of Eden, boasting a pristine environment that rivaled untouched natural worlds. Such a lush and green planet naturally attracted the Celesterrors, who adored it.\nNearly all the Celesterrors in the Empire of Eden called this planet home. It was a major draw for both domestic and foreign tourists, but it also caught the eye of some unsavory characters.\nAn illegal research lab, known for capturing Celesterrors for experiments, secretly set up shop on Inferno, building their lab deep underground.\nBy the time the Empire of Eden realized what was happening, it was already too late.\nThough they swiftly executed the criminals responsible, the damage was done. Many Celesterrors had been infected by the virus, transforming them into mindless creatures known as Fallen Beasts.\nThe most terrifying aspect of this virus was its extreme contagiousness. While humans could avoid infection with the right precautions, the infection rate among Celesterrors was a grim 100%.\nWith no cure in sight, the Empire of Eden had no choice but to quarantine the entire planet.\nHowever, maintaining such a strict quarantine came with a hefty price tag, draining hundreds of billions of costs every single day.\nDespite the minister’s moral compass telling him to keep the virus contained, the financial strain became unbearable.\nAfter a few months, the treasury was nearly empty, forcing the minister to abandon the quarantine efforts.\nEven then, he couldn’t stomach the thought of the virus spreading across the galaxy. So, he devised a plan: turn the planet into a competition site for the upcoming mecha tournament.\nHis hope? That perhaps the brilliant minds from other nations might find a way to save the Celesterrors on the planet.\nAfter hearing the minister’s explanation, Sykes and the others found it difficult to blame him further.\nYet, Roland’s gaze remained icy as he remarked, \"No matter how you try to spin it, you still turned it into a contest where Fallen Beasts are killed for points. Deep down, you never really believed those students could save the Celesterrors, did you?\"\nThe minister of Eden, seeing his true motives laid bare, didn’t get angry. Instead, he responded with resolve, \"The Empire of Eden tried for five months and couldn’t find a way to save the Celesterrors. How can you expect me to believe a bunch of teenagers could?\"\nThe harsh reality was that the minister had no faith that these students could crack the mystery of the virus plaguing the planet.\nHis decision to use the planet as a competition site wasn’t driven by hope for a cure. It was a calculated move.\nIf, by the end of the tournament, the virus remained unchecked, he could justify wiping out the entire planet.\nAfter all, destroying was easier than saving. Sacrificing the Celesterrors on one planet to protect countless others across the galaxy—that was the safest choice.\nJust as the minister’s determination grew stronger, Admiral Sykes interrupted him with a simple question.\n\"What if I tell you Arix is there?\"\nSykes spoke calmly, but his words hit like a bolt of lightning. The minister froze, the resolve in his eyes crumbling in an instant. His lips trembled as he glanced at Sykes.\nYes, Arix. The same Arix who had beaten a disease that had plagued humanity for centuries. And now, he was among those children.\nThe minister fell into a deep silence. The thought of Arix finding a way to conquer this new virus during the competition was too overwhelming.\n...\nBack at the competition site, Cirilla and Elio returned with disappointing news.\nOf the four major countires aside from the Alliance, only the Empire of Sacred Moonlight had been held back by Cassian.\nThe Kraiton Empire, under Celesterror’s influence, had agreed to stop hunting—for three days.\nIf no cure for the virus was found by then, the hunt would resume.\nThe other two countries? They didn’t even bother with the Alliance mecha team, dismissing them as delusional.\n\"The Empire of Merman doesn’t care if these creatures are Celesterror or not,\" Elio said through gritted teeth. \"Even if they are, it doesn’t matter to them!\"\n\"You’re lucky. The Empire of Eden thought I was lying to them. I almost didn’t make it back,\" Deanna added, shaking her head.\nAfter hearing everyone’s reports, Drexel wasn’t surprised. He had already predicted this outcome.\nThe competitors of these freshman mecha competitions had killed their allies previously, so targeting Celesterrors was a natural thing. If it wasn’t for Cassian and Arix’s engagement, the Empire of Sacred Moonlight might’ve kept hunting as well.\nDrexel sighed, ready to offer some words of encouragement. However, suddenly, an emergency alert popped up on all the participants’ opticomputers.\nNotice: Due to special circumstances, the judges and referees have unanimously decided to suspend the killing of Fallen Beasts for five days. Additionally, if any mecha team can develop a cure for the virus within those five days and submit it to the Inferno competition base, that team will win the competition, regardless of previous points.\nDrexel’s eyes widened, and his planned comfort speech got stuck in his throat. The Alliance mecha team exchanged looks before breaking into cheers.\n\"This is amazing! Someone out there must be looking out for these Celesterrors!\" Arix was practically bouncing with excitement.\n\"What are we waiting for? Let’s head to Inferno’s capital city!\" Cirilla urged, grinning.\nDrexel smiled too. With a quick gesture, the entire Alliance mecha team vanished, ready for action.\nMeanwhile, other mecha teams were busy cursing their luck.\n...\n\"Captain, what now?\" The Alphas of the Elden turned to their leader, frustration in their eyes. They had been leading the competition by a mile, but now, with these sudden rule changes, all their hard work seemed pointless.\nBlaze, however, appeared unfazed. He had seen this coming. An understanding glint flashed in his eyes.\n\"No need to panic. This could actually turn in our favor,\" Blaze said, a mysterious smile playing on his lips.\n...\nAs for the Empire of Sacred Moonlight...\n\"Is Eden’s leadership stupid or what? Why would they suddenly change the competition rules?\" Kares grumbled.\n\"Not that it matters. We weren’t going to win anyway. Prince Cassian already promised the Alliance team he wouldn’t kill those Fallen Beasts,\" Galen replied, chomping on a chicken leg he’d somehow acquired.\nKares just stared at him.\n\"Damn love-struck fool. Go find us some wild veggies or something!\"\nThe members of the Kraiton mecha team were frustrated.\n\"What is the Empire of Eden thinking? This was supposed to be a mecha competition, and now it’s turned into some kind of research contest, and we’re supposed to develop a virus cure? Who are they kidding?\"\nLiron, who usually worried about everything, surprisingly took a laid-back approach this time. \"Well, we already agreed with the Alliance mecha team not to kill any Fallen Beasts for three days, so a couple more days won’t hurt.\"\n\"But why would the Empire of Eden suddenly stop us from killing the Fallen Beasts? Could it be that the Alliance mecha team was telling the truth?\" Branson suddenly said, with a hint of doubt.\nLiron looked at his usually carefree captain in surprise. He didn’t have time to check what was happening before Branson’s words drew him in. Thinking back to what the Alliance mecha team had said earlier, his mood suddenly grew heavy.\n’Could those ugly Fallen Beasts really be the soft and adorable Celesterror?’\nUnlike the other mecha teams, who were just grumbling, the Sirens were absolutely furious. The Empire of Merman already had few doctors, and none had come to participate in the competition. Now, the rules had changed to focus on virus research...\nThe tallest merman among the Sirens, with a cold and sinister look in his eyes, said, \"If we can’t develop a cure for the virus, then no one else should be able to either! Wouldn’t it be better if we all lost together?\"\nThe Sirens exchanged glances, and suddenly, they all started rubbing their hands together mischievously. \"Heh, that sounds good!\"\nWhen it comes to sabotage, Sirens are the experts!",

      "content": "Chapter 259: The Third Variant\nThe sudden twist in the competition rules didn’t just catch the five mecha teams off guard—it sent shockwaves through the audience watching the live stream.\n@StolenHeartOfGold: \"Wait, what? Did the organizers just pull a fast one? Why are mecha pilots suddenly playing virus detectives?\"\n@BunnyGriller: \"This makes zero sense. It’s like asking chefs to put out fires. What’s the connection here?\"\n@MatchstickGirl: \"Is no one thinking about the Fallen Beasts? If they actually find a cure, doesn’t that mean those who died were wrongfully treated?\"\n@SilentSeer: \"Good point. Let’s all take a moment to reflect on the Fallen Beasts that were wiped out.\"\n@LoveBlind: \"Now that you bring it up, could this explain why the Alliance mecha team suddenly stopped killing the Fallen Beasts? If that’s true, then maybe the origins of these creatures need a closer look.\"\nThat last comment sparked a wave of speculation among viewers, with many starting to suspect there was more going on than they realized.\nThe internet’s reach is no joke. Before long, someone dug up the truth: the Fallen Beasts were actually Celesterrors, infected by a virus.\nWhen this revelation hit, the online community exploded. If it had just been about slaughtering ordinary beasts, people might have grudgingly accepted it.\nBut Celesterrors? They were a species almost as intelligent as humans, and the idea of wiping them out just because they were sick was horrifying.\nSoon enough, voices across the interstellar net started speaking out for the Celesterrors. Some enraged users even went as far as reporting the Empire of Eden to the Interstellar Association for the Protection of Intelligent Animals.\nNot long after, representatives from the Association reached out to the president of the Empire of Eden.\n\"Honorable President, you are being accused of deliberately hiding information about the Celesterrors, resulting in the massacre of 2,300 of them. You need to come with us.\"\nThe representative, decked out in a military uniform from the Interstellar Alliance, gave the president a stern look.\n\"Understood,\" the president replied, nodding to everyone before following them out.\nThe Interstellar Alliance, made up of top officials from the major interstellar nations, was tasked with maintaining balance among the various countries.\nThis time, the president’s selfish actions that led to the deaths of so many Celesterrors meant he was headed for a public trial. While his position might shield him from severe punishment, a hefty fine was almost guaranteed.\nBack at the Competition...\nArix had no clue that her actions had caused someone to be arrested. She and her team had just reached the capital of Inferno, completely worn out.\n\"We made it, finally. I’m beat,\" Elio groaned, sinking into his seat.\n\"So, do we rest before heading in, or just push through now?\" Arix asked, wiping the sweat from her forehead, her voice weary.\nThe rest of the team was just as drained, but nobody complained. They waited for their captain’s call.\nDrexel, still catching his breath but otherwise okay, stared intently at Inferno’s only city. After a moment of thought, his resolve solidified.\n\"The rules have changed, which means the other teams are probably making moves too. To stay ahead, we should go in now.\"\n\"Understood!\" Arix and the others echoed, shaking off their exhaustion as they snapped back into their disciplined roles. They were once again a focused, tight-knit mecha team.\nAs soon as they entered the city, a massive Fallen Beast, much larger than any they had encountered before, let out a deafening roar and charged straight at them.\n\"Defensive positions, everyone!\" Drexel commanded without missing a beat. He stepped forward, his spear flashing as he expertly flipped the charging beast onto the ground.\nThe Fallen Beast thrashed wildly, its blood-red eyes blazing with fury as it tried to break free, roaring in a mix of rage and desperation.\nDrexel tightened his grip, holding the beast down with all his strength. Then, with a quick glance at Arix and Varden, he said, \"Arix, Varden, get over here. We need to see if this Celesterror is carrying the original virus strain.\"\nArix and Varden moved swiftly, one drawing blood while the other ran diagnostic scans. Their teamwork was flawless, and they soon had the results.\nArix’s face fell slightly when she saw the data. She looked up at Drexel and shook his head. \"It’s the third-generation strain, not the original virus.\"\nDrexel clicked his tongue in frustration, then knocked the Fallen Beast out cold with a precise strike, dragging its limp body to the side of the road.\n\"It’s progress. We’ve gone from the 18th generation to the 3rd. If we keep pushing forward, we’ll find the original strain soon,\" Drexel said, rallying the team.\nEveryone nodded, ready to continue. But just as they were about to move, one of the Alliance team’s mechas stumbled.\nArix quickly turned and saw that it was Lydia’s mecha. Concern flashed across her face as she called out, \"Lydia! What’s happening?\"\n\"I... I feel dizzy...\" Lydia’s voice was weak, almost a whisper. The mecha’s system, detecting that something was wrong with its pilot, automatically opened the cockpit.\nLydia looked pale and drained. She slumped in her seat, too weak to even climb out of the mecha.\nThe team didn’t waste a second when they saw what went down. They hurried to get Lydia out of her cockpit.\nArix, always calm under pressure, placed two fingers on Lydia’s neck, checking for a pulse.\nAfter a tense moment, Arix’s expression shifted into a frown. \"Lydia, you’ve been pushing your psychic power way too hard. You were this close to letting the virus breach your psychic world.\"\nLydia, looking pale and guilty, shook her head. Her voice was soft as she apologized, \"I’m sorry. I didn’t want to slow everyone down, but I guess I did in the end. I’m really sorry...\"\nDrexel’s voice was gentle, free of any hint of blame. \"It’s okay, Lydia. Go rest. You’ve done more than enough.\"\nWithout waiting for a reply, he hit the button to withdraw her from the competition.\nLydia could only nod slightly before her consciousness faded completely.\nAs their first teammate was taken out, a heavy mood settled over the Alliance mecha team. They’d thought they were careful enough, but losing a member so quickly stung.\nBut Drexel, as their leader, couldn’t afford to dwell on it. \"Alright, we’re close to finding the original strain. Now’s not the time to get discouraged. Everyone, stick with me. Let’s move!\" His voice cut through the tension, and with a determined nod, the team pressed on.\nThe closer they got to the city center, the fiercer the Fallen Beasts became. Despite Drexel’s best efforts to shield Arix, one beast broke through their defenses, landing a brutal hit that sent Arix flying.\n\"Bang!\" The sound of her mecha crashing into the ground was loud.\nDrexel spun around, worry etched across his face. \"Arix, are you alright?\"\nInside her cockpit, Arix wiped blood from the corner of her mouth, forcing down the metallic taste. \"I’m fine. Just lost focus for a second.\"\n\"Stay behind me and watch yourself,\" Drexel instructed quickly before diving back into the battle.\nArix gave a weak response, but everyone was too caught up in the fight to catch the strain in her voice.\n\"Arix, you just lost essential blood a while ago. Your body hasn’t fully bounced back. Don’t push yourself too hard,\" Sylvana’s voice echoed with concern in Arix’s psychic world.\n\"I know,\" Arix replied, trying to sound reassuring, but the situation left little room for rest.\nWhen the battle finally ended, Arix let out a long breath of relief. She slumped back in her seat, her pale face and bloodless lips revealing just how drained she really was.\nThere was no time to waste, though. Arix patted her cheeks to bring some life back into them. Then she quickly exited her cockpit, heading straight for Varden to start collecting blood samples from the Fallen Beasts for analysis.\nThankfully, the results were encouraging. The virus within these beasts was strikingly close to the original strain.",

      "content": "Chapter 260: Captain Vlad\nHolding the sample with a hint of satisfaction, Arix spoke over the mecha channel, \"This sample will do. We can start working on the antidote right here.\"\n\"Got it,\" Drexel replied without missing a beat.\nHe then directed the team, \"Let’s set up camp here. Everyone, follow my lead.\"\n\"Yes, sir!\" The Alliance team members responded, a mix of exhaustion and excitement in their voices.\nAfter pushing so hard, they were finally getting a moment to catch their breath.\nThey worked together to set up their temporary camp, making sure Arix’s research tent was up first before handling their own shelters.\nOnce inside the tent, Arix and Varden wasted no time. They set up their pharmaceutical equipment and immediately began the race against the clock to develop the antidote.\nDrexel had just given the order for everyone to rest when the Empire of Eden’s mecha team appeared on the horizon.\nThe moment the Alliance team spotted them, they snapped into high alert.\nOn the battlefield, there was no room for kindness, and they knew that their rivals would be anything less than dangerous.\nBlaze, the captain of the Eden team, took a moment to observe the Alliance group. His eyes briefly lingered on the Fallen Beast they had restrained, before he turned to Drexel with a smile.\n\"Captain Drexel, mind if we rest our team next to yours for a bit?\" he asked, his tone smooth and courteous.\nDrexel returned the smile, though his guard was up. \"The ground isn’t mine to claim, so go ahead, Captain Blaze,\" he replied politely. It wasn’t the time to spark unnecessary conflict.\n\"Much appreciated.\" Blaze nodded, signaling his team to set up camp nearby, just close enough to keep an eye on the Alliance team.\nAmong Blaze’s team, a blond, blue-eyed young man couldn’t hide his concern. \"Blaze, it looks like the Alliance team is already working on the virus. With Arix on their side, our chances aren’t looking great.\"\nBlaze remained unfazed. \"Don’t worry,\" he said, his voice calm and reassuring. \"If this were any other virus, maybe we’d be at a disadvantage. But remember, Inferno originated in the Empire of Eden. We’ve been on this case since the outbreak. Our antidote might only be halfway done, but it’s still miles ahead of what anyone else has.\"\nBlaze’s confidence was unmistakable, his eyes reflecting the certainty of someone who knew he had the upper hand.\nThe blond young man seemed to realize this, too, and the worry on his face quickly faded, replaced by the same confidence Blaze exuded.\nSome people are born with a head start in life, and others must claw their way forward. From the moment this competition began, the Eden mecha team had already crossed the starting line far ahead of the rest.\n...\nThe merman mecha team quickly pieced together the Eden team’s strategy.\nWhen they arrived at the city center and saw both the Alliance and Eden teams already set up, they didn’t immediately zero in on the Alliance group. Instead, their gazes darkened as they sized up the Eden team from a distance.\n\"Captain, I bet the Eden team already has the virus antidote. And if not, they probably have something close,\" the merman team’s strategist whispered to their captain.\nVlad, the merman captain, let a mischievous smile play on his lips. \"Sounds about right. In that case, they’ll be our first target.\"\nWith their plan set, the merman team boldly ignored the disdainful glances from the Eden team and began setting up camp right next to them, with a casualness that was almost insulting.\n\"Captain Vlad, there’s plenty of space around here. Don’t you think it’d be better to move a bit further away?\" said Basell, the blond member of the Eden team. His polite smile failed to mask his irritation.\nVlad grinned as if he didn’t catch the underlying tension. \"Come on, now. We’re all from allied nations, aren’t we? Being close by gives a sense of security, don’t you think?\"\n\"You!\" Basell’s patience snapped as his eyes flared with anger, and he was ready to make a move when Blaze, the Eden team captain, stopped him with a calm hand.\n\"Basell, hold on.\" Blaze’s voice was smooth as he turned to Vlad, his demeanor still polite. \"You’re right, Captain Vlad. We’re allies, after all. Feel free to get comfortable.\"\nVlad nodded in mock satisfaction, but when his eyes lingered on Blaze’s face, something flickered in his expression.\nBlaze was not just skilled; he was also strikingly handsome.\n’Isn’t he an Omega? Omegas could have children...’\nVlad’s thoughts got noticed by the towering Alphas on the Eden team, who immediately bristled with hostility.\n’This damned merman! How dare he eye our captain like that?’\nFeeling the lethal stares from the Eden team, Vlad sighed. Blaze was good-looking and capable of bearing children—if only he wasn’t male.\nVlad had always preferred curvy ladies over flat-chested young men.\nThe only female Alpha present had a figure that perfectly matched his tastes. But alas, female Alphas couldn’t bear children—they were the ones who made others do it.\nVlad sighed again.\n’Life’s never easy.’\nAs the tension between the merman and Eden teams grew thick, the Alliance team watched the whole spectacle from the sidelines, clearly entertained.\n\"Hey, Drexel, what’s going on over there? Looks like things are heating up,\" Elio said, casually munching on a pear as he observed the brewing conflict between the other two teams.\nDrexel, taking a bite of his own apple, glanced over and shrugged. \"Looks like that fish has a thing for one of the Alphas on the Eden team. Must’ve caught a crush.\"\nElio nearly choked on his food, laughing at the absurdity of the situation. The drama among their competitors was turning out to be more interesting than they’d anticipated.\n\"Oh, come on, seriously? Crossing gender lines is one thing, but species too? The Empire of Merman must not be very picky. I’m starting to feel sorry for the lizards back in their country,\" Elio muttered, shuddering at the mental image that popped into his head.\nDrexel, still chewing on his apple, shot Elio a sidelong glance. \"Actually, you might want to worry about yourself. With that sweet face of yours, you’re pretty popular in certain circles.\"\nElio’s face darkened instantly. Without missing a beat, he chucked his half-eaten pear at Drexel, practically roaring, \"Drexel! Are you trying to get yourself killed?!\"\nDrexel dodged the pear with ease, his expression shifting to mock hurt. \"Hey, no need to get so worked up. I’m just looking out for you, man. You know your old man Lasair would flip out if you decided to swing that way.\"\n\"Get lost! Even if you did, there’s no chance I would,\" Elio shot back, glaring at Drexel like he was the most annoying thing he’d ever seen. Fuming, he turned on his heel and stomped off, clearly done with the conversation.\nDrexel raised an eyebrow in amusement, resisting the urge to push further.\n’Dramatical Denial is a form of admission,’\nhe thought, but kept the comment to himself. He wasn’t about to tempt fate, especially knowing Elio had that monstrous two-million-astrocredit blade at his disposal.\nWith a satisfied click of his tongue, Drexel finished off the last bite of his apple.\nThen, pulling out another one, he leaned back, ready to watch the drama continue to unfold across from them.\nThe show was just getting started.",

      "content": "Chapter 261: The Cure\nInside the tent, the atmosphere was tense, a stark contrast to the lighthearted, even silly mood outside.\nArix and Varden were both busy, working at an incredible pace, as if every minute needed to be stretched into ten.\nFortunately, both of them were nearly at Grandmaster level in potion-making, allowing them to conduct their research quickly and accurately.\nVarden relied heavily on research instruments. At that moment, he was typing commands rapidly while keeping a close eye on the screen, where lines of complex code were appearing at lightning speed.\n\"The Inferno virus has been traced back to its origin—gliomia, one of the deadly diseases in the galaxy,\" Varden explained to Arix as he analyzed the code in his mind. \"Gliomia is a brain disease. The virus can spread through the brain, leading to a high recurrence rate and a high mortality rate. However, for some reason, the death rate is currently low. Instead, the virus causes hallucinations, visual disturbances, and severe mental chaos in those infected. It spreads through saliva, air, and blood, with a nearly 100% infection rate among Celesterrors.\"\nArix nodded seriously, appreciating Varden’s explanation. \"Thanks. I’ll take it from here.\" She then resumed her own frantic work on the experiments.\nNow that they had identified the cause of the illness, the process of finding a cure became much simpler. Arix’s mind was already overflowing with potential treatment plans, but with time running short, she had to move even faster to test them.\nTime flew by.\nOn the other side, the Eden’s mecha team was hard at work.\n\"Captain, we did it!\" The chemist from the Eden’s mecha team ran out of the tent in excitement, waving the potion in his hand. The commotion immediately caught everyone’s attention.\nAlthough the Alliance’s mecha team members felt a pang of envy, they remained rooted to their spots, openly expressing their admiration.\nMeanwhile, the expressions of the mermen turned more complex. A few of the Sirens exchanged subtle glances before turning their eyes to their captain.\nVlad’s face still bore a harmless smile, but his fingers secretly made a gesture.\n\"Are you sure?\" Blaze, overwhelmed with joy, hadn’t noticed the unusual behavior of the merman mecha team.\n\"Absolutely. We’ve already tested it on a Fallen Beast, and this potion is definitely the cure!\" The chemist from the Loran squad was about to hand the potion to his captain when suddenly, someone rushed toward him.\nBlaze’s eyes narrowed as he instantly recognized the intent of the approaching figure. His hand, which had been reaching for the potion, suddenly changed direction to strike at the person trying to steal it.\nVlad dodged the attack. Instead of feeling embarrassed at being caught, he only became more brazen. \"Oh, come on, Captain Blaze, don’t be so stingy. I just wanted to take a look.\"\nOnce Blaze was sure his teammates were protecting the chemist, his formerly kind and harmless demeanor vanished, replaced by a cold, piercing gaze aimed at Vlad.\n\"I think you’d rather be a dead fish,\" Blaze said with a chilling smile. In that moment, a terrifying psychic power burst from his body like a raging beast.\n\"You... you actually have Supergiant+ psychic power!\" Vlad’s shock was impossible to hide, his eyes wide with disbelief.\n’How can this seemingly innocent, almost delicate-looking guy possess such terrifying strength?’\nBlaze, the \"sheep,\" was anything but weak.\nDespite his surprise, Vlad quickly regained his composure. His own psychic power was nothing to scoff at—it was also at Supergiant+ level. Without missing a beat, he ordered his team to keep pushing forward, determined to get their hands on that potion.\nWhat followed was explosive. The merman mecha team, already itching for a fight, clashed head-on with the Eden mecha team, whose anger had been simmering just beneath the surface.\nIt was like throwing a match into a pile of dry wood. The battle escalated in seconds, spiraling completely out of control.\nThe Alliance’s mecha team, who had been watching from the sidelines, was initially caught off guard by the sudden outbreak of violence.\nThey tried stepping in to break things up, but soon realized that this was not their fight. In fact, if either team took a hit or lost a member, it only meant fewer enemies for them to deal with down the line. They decided to let it play out.\nAt that moment, Arix emerged from the tent, holding a vial of the cure in her hand. She stopped short, staring at the chaos before her with a confused expression.\n\"What’s going on?\" Arix asked, clearly puzzled by the scene.\n\"Oh, nothing much, just a little fight,\" Drexel replied, trying to sound nonchalant. But as soon as he realized what he’d said, his eyes went wide with panic. He whipped around to see Arix standing there, and his heart nearly stopped.\nA cold shiver ran down Drexel’s spine when he noticed the potion she was holding. \"Arix! Get back inside, now!\" he shouted, his voice laced with fear.\nHe knew exactly why the two teams were brawling like this. If they found out that the Alliance had also developed a cure, they’d become the next target, and the fallout could be even worse.\nBut Drexel’s warning came too late. One of the merman mecha members had already caught sight of the vial in Arix’s hand.\nThe Siren’s eyes gleamed with a dangerous excitement as they pivoted and lunged toward her. Grabbing that potion would make them a hero in the eyes of their team.\nWith that thought driving them, the Siren’s expression turned vicious, and they launched a deadly, merciless attack at Arix.\nWhen the Sirens attacked, Arix didn’t have a second to think—her body just acted on instinct.\nHer hand shot up, and before she knew it, a powerful surge of psychic energy blasted out, sending one of the Sirens flying.\nIt wasn’t until she saw the guy crumpled on the ground, coughing up blood, that it hit Arix what she’d done.\nArix quickly pulled back, a wave of guilt washing over her. She glanced at her brother, her voice shaky, \"He’s coughing up blood... is he going to be okay?\"\nEven though she had a gut feeling this person had bad intentions, the sight of someone hurt like that made her uneasy.\nDrexel gave the barely conscious merman a quick, sympathetic look before turning back to Arix. \"He’s fine. Not exactly a good guy, though—he was here to steal the potion.\"\nRelief flooded Arix, and she let out a breath she didn’t realize she was holding. \"Oh, that’s a relief,\" she muttered, thankful she hadn’t just hurt a passerby. That would’ve been hard to live down.\nDrexel’s reassuring smile didn’t last long. Suddenly, his eyes widened with panic, and he yelled, \"Arix, move!\"\nEven though she didn’t fully understand, Arix trusted her brother. She quickly threw up a psychic barrier around herself.\nA split second later, sharp limbs slammed against her shield with a loud crack.\n\"Insectoid?!\" Arix gasped as she stared at the jagged limb pressing against her barrier.\nShe then looked up in shock at the creature standing before her.\nAn insectoid showing up in the middle of the competition was the last thing she expected. And judging by the stunned expressions on everyone else’s faces, they were just as blindsided.",

      "content": "Chapter 262: Quispe Exposed\n\"You’ve teamed up with insectoids?!\" Someone from Eden’s mecha team yelled, his anger directed at the merman squad.\nBlaze knew this wasn’t the mermen’s doing, but he wasn’t about to let facts get in the way.\n\"I never thought the Sirens would stoop so low,\" Elio added with a sneer.\nThe mecha teams from the Alliance knew the truth, too, but after the mermen’s earlier attack on Arix, they were more than happy to fan the flames.\n\"Are you seriously starting rumors right now? Insectoids never come alone!\" Vlad snapped, rolling his eyes at the petty accusations.\nHis words cut through the noise, making everyone tense up. As much as they all hated to admit it, Vlad was right. Insectoids never showed up alone.\nSure enough, more insectoids began emerging from the shadows, surrounding the group from every direction.\n\"Ah, we meet again, little bugs,\" the insectoid prince, Hardy, sneered, his gaze locking onto Arix with unsettling intensity.\nDrexel’s face darkened the moment he saw Hardy. He hadn’t forgotten how close this creature had come to taking Arix’s life.\n\"Go to hell!\" Drexel roared, psychic energy crackling around him as it formed into a spear. He aimed it at Hardy, his entire being radiating deadly intent.\nPerched confidently atop the other insectoids, Hardy smirked, clearly unfazed by Drexel’s threat.\n\"No need to pretend anymore. They’re trapped on this planet now anyway,\" Hardy muttered, more to himself than anyone else.\nDrexel’s brow furrowed, trying to decipher Hardy’s cryptic words. But before he could make sense of it, a sharp pain pierced through his chest.\nBlood sprayed from Drexel’s mouth as he staggered, clutching his chest in shock. He turned, disbelief etched on his face, trying to comprehend what had just happened.\n\"Drexel!\" Arix’s scream tore through the chaos, her eyes blazing with fury as she rushed to her brother’s side.\n\"Quinnie, why?\" Drexel choked out, blood slowly dripping from the corner of his mouth. His eyes were wide with shock as he stared at Quinnie, someone he never thought he’d need to guard against.\nArix’s gaze locked onto Quinnie too, a mix of confusion and burning hatred swirling inside her. She couldn’t believe that, someone who had always fought by their side, someone they trusted so much, turned on them like this and hurt Drexel.\nThe rest of the Alliance’s mecha team snapped into action, closing ranks around Drexel while casting suspicious and hostile glances at Quinnie. They couldn’t believe what they were seeing.\nBut Quinnie, now the focus of everyone’s anger, stayed silent. She just stared down at her bloodstained hands, the weight of her earlier hesitation hanging in the air.\nHowever, that hesitation was gone now.\nWithout a word, Quinnie gave the Arix siblings one last, lingering look before she moved, leaping effortlessly to Hardy’s side.\n\"How could you all be so blind?!\" Hardy’s laughter cut through the tension, dripping with mockery. \"You never even suspected that your so-called ’trusted teammate’ was actually our crown prince all along!\"\nHe sneered, his eyes full of contempt as he surveyed the Alliance’s mecha team, relishing in their shock.\nIn that moment, Quinnie’s appearance shifted. Her blond hair and red eyes were still there, but now they exuded an unmistakable arrogance. Her eyes, now fully insectoid, looked down coldly at the group.\nThe realization hit like a ton of bricks. The teammate they had fought beside, the one they had trusted implicitly, was none other than Quispe—the crown prince of the insectoids.\nThe situation had spiraled out of control. The country’s admiral finally grasped the severity of the insectoid invasion—it was worse than anyone had thought.\n...\n\"President of the Empire of Eden, I expect a full explanation after this match!\" Sykes demanded before swiftly turning on his heel and leaving.\nAdmirals from other nations weren’t far behind. They each fired off sharp, threatening words before storming out, making it clear that they weren’t sticking around for formalities.\nThat left only the president of the Empire of Eden, sitting there with a strained smile and muttering, \"Gosh, what on earth is wrong?\"\n...\nThe moment he got back on the ship, Sykes rushed straight to the command room.\n\"Rear Admiral Kering, what’s the current situation?\" Sykes asked, his expression so intense it looked like his eyebrows might fuse together.\nWhat should’ve been a straightforward event had been thrown into chaos by the insectoid attack, and it was eating at him.\nKellan’s face mirrored the tension in the air as he worked furiously at the opticomputer. He paused when Sykes spoke, looking up with a grave expression.\n\"Sir, the Inferno is completely surrounded by insectoids. If we’re going to break through, it’ll take at least three days.\"\n\"Three days?! Those kids could be in serious danger by then!\" Sykes shouted, unable to keep his frustration in check.\nKellan was feeling just as grim. He knew every second counted, and the risk to the students, including his own siblings, was rising fast. The insectoids had planned their attack well, and with someone on the inside helping them, their options were running thin.\n\"Is there really no other way?\" Sykes asked, his voice heavy with defeat.\nKellan hesitated, clearly torn about something.\n\"Out with it! Don’t hold back!\" Sykes snapped, sensing something was up.\nKellan clenched his fists and finally forced out, \"There is...one option. But it involves piloting the level-eight mecha...\"\n\"That’s enough. I get it. You don’t need to say more,\" Sykes interrupted, already knowing where this was headed. He quickly grabbed the Space Button from his chest and turned to leave without hesitation.\n\"Sir! You can’t go alone! It’s too dangerous!\" Kellan tried to stop him.\nSykes pushed him aside, determined to keep moving towards the deck.\n\"Admiral, there are countless insectoids out there. Even with the level-eight mecha, there’s no guarantee you’ll make it back...\"\nKellan started, but Sykes cut him off again.\n\"Rear Admiral Kering, all the countries are under attack. The other four level-eight mechas of the Alliance are stuck on the front lines. I’m the only one left who can do this.\"\nSykes paused at the door to the command room, turning to look at Kellan with a serious expression.\n\"While I’m gone, everything else falls to you. And Kellan, make sure those kids get out safely.\"\nWith that, Sykes vanished from the command room.\nKellan stood there, the weight of the moment sinking in. Finally, he closed his eyes, raised his hand in a solemn salute, and whispered, \"Admiral Sykes, may you fight bravely and return safely.\"\nMeanwhile, on Inferno...\nThe moment the Alliance’s mecha team realized they had traitors in their midst, their anger was palpable.\nTeeth clenched and fists tightened, they fought the urge to tear Quispe and Hardy apart right then and there.\nDespite the hostile stares, Hardy had the audacity to smirk at Quispe. \"Why’d you just injure him earlier? With your skills, you could’ve taken him out with ease.\"\nQuispe shot him a cold glare. \"What I do is none of your business.\"\n\"Sure, sure,\" Hardy replied, waving off the tension. \"But remember, our target was never him. Just don’t screw up the next part. The Empress won’t forgive you if you do.\"\nQuispe stayed silent for a moment before asking, \"Hardy, do you really think what we’re doing is right?\"\n\"Have you lost it, Quispe?\" Hardy’s eyes widened in disbelief. \"Are you actually questioning the Empress?\"\n\"Hardy, don’t forget—our people were once humanoid too. But since the Empress rose to power, they’ve been devolving into insects.\" Quispe’s gaze drifted over the surrounding insectoids, his eyes clouded with a sorrowful nostalgia.\nIn the past, the insectoid Empire was different. It wasn’t just the royal family that could take human form.\nBack then, though their numbers were small, they were simply divided into male and female.\nOnce hatched, as long as they spent time in the ancestral lands, they could transform into humans.\nBut everything changed when the Empress came to power; now only the royal family retained that ability.\nFor once, Hardy was silent, but after a beat, he let out a bitter laugh. \"Quispe, whether what we’re doing is right or wrong, what does it matter to us? We may have royal blood, but to the Empress, we’re nothing more than tools—easily crushed whenever she feels like it.\"\nSome truths are hard to accept, and Hardy knew this all too well.\nA bitter smile played on his lips as he recalled a truth he’d once overheard. All the insectoids, himself and Quispe included, were just tools in the Empress’s grand scheme. But if they succeeded in their mission, there might still be hope for the insectoids to return to what they once were.\nHardy’s gaze sharpened as he watched Quispe. \"You’re not getting soft on the humans, are you?\"\nQuispe didn’t answer, but his shoulders slumped slightly.\nLiving among humans had changed him. He had made friends, found comrades, and even... someone he cared about.\nMemories of a passionate kiss flashed through his mind, making his resolve waver.\nSeeing the distant look in Quispe’s eyes, Hardy’s concern grew. Before it could consume him, he shouted, \"Quispe, don’t forget why you’re here! Killing Arix is our only shot at reclaiming what we’ve lost. It’s the only way we have a chance at survival. Even if you don’t care about yourself, think about our people! They don’t deserve to live like this, trapped and bred like maggots, stripped of their dignity!\"\nHardy’s words seemed to cut through Quispe’s internal struggle, a wave of sorrow sweeping over him. But that sorrow brought clarity, sharpening his focus.\nYes, he was more than just an insectoid. He carried the weight of his people’s hopes. If it meant sacrificing himself, so be it.\nAs for Arix...\nHe’d have to apologize later.\nQuispe closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and when he opened them, his gaze was cold and resolute. \"Hardy, let’s begin.\"\nA satisfied grin spread across Hardy’s face. He pulled out a crystal and tossed it into the air.\nThe crystal shattered, and a terrifying black hole appeared in the sky, slowly expanding.\nHardy and Quispe dropped to one knee, their heads bowed in reverence. In unison, they declared, \"Welcome, Your Majesty the Queen!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 263: Escape\nAs the massive, ominous hole ripped open in the sky, the three mecha teams froze.\nTheir hearts raced, anxiety settling in their bones. None of them knew what it was, but the black void radiated danger.\nIt felt like some lurking monster might emerge at any second, ready to snatch their lives away.\nArix tore her gaze from the sky, focusing on Drexel in her arms.\nHis injuries were severe.\nArix’s expression hardened with concern. She had no idea if they’d make it out alive, but at least Cassian wasn’t there. A small relief—one less life at risk.\n\"Arix!\"\nThe voice jolted her, and she turned, disbelief flooding her face.\nCassian was sprinting toward her!\n\"Cassian?\" Her voice barely masked her shock. Seeing him standing there felt unreal. There was no relief on her face—just pure astonishment.\nCassian’s grin lit up when she said his name. \"Don’t worry, Arix. I’m here!\"\nArix stared at him, eyes narrowing.\n’Great, that’s exactly why I’m more worried now.’\nWith a deep sigh, she rubbed her forehead, trying to hold it together. The timing was almost too much.\nCassian’s grin faded as he noticed Drexel slumped against her. \"What happened to him? He looks terrible.\"\n\"Ambushed by an insectoid,\" Arix explained, glancing down at Drexel. He was in bad shape, even after chugging a healing potion. His condition was barely a fraction of what it should be.\n\"I’m... fine. I’ll manage,\" Drexel muttered, trying to lift his head, his breath ragged.\nArix shoved him back down, frowning. \"Stop acting tough, Drex.\" Her stern look made him immediately shut up, offering Cassian a weak, awkward smile that seemed to say,\n’See what I have to deal with?’\nCassian let out a small laugh and gently took Drexel from her. \"He’s heavy, Arix. Let me carry him.\" His tone was light, though the situation was anything but.\nArix rolled her sore shoulder and nodded. \"You’re not wrong. Thanks.\"\nDrexel, feeling somewhat offended, thought,\n’Seriously? Do injured people not get any sympathy here?’\nWith Drexel safely in his arms, Cassian scanned the scene. The squads were boxed in, completely surrounded by hordes of insectoids. Breaking through had been tough enough for him, even with his Supergiant+ abilities. Getting everyone out would be brutal.\nAnd that black hole overhead? It wasn’t waiting for them.\nCassian’s eyes darkened as he looked at Arix. \"We have to move. Now.\"\nArix got the message immediately. She spun to face her team. \"Cirilla, Elio, it’s up to us. We’ve got the strongest fighting power left. Everyone else is depending on us!\"\nDeanna and Marceau were capable, sure, but right now, they could only manage defense. Arix didn’t expect them to do more.\nCirilla and Elio gave her a firm nod. Without wasting any more time, the group climbed into their mechas. Arix’s voice rang through the comms channel: \"Go!\"\nWith that, the Alliance mecha team unleashed everything they had, smashing into the swarm of insectoids. The other teams exchanged quick looks and, seeing their shot, surged forward, joining the Alliance’s desperate breakout.\nThe battle had only just begun.\nHigh above the battlefield, Hardy and Quispe knelt in silence, their sharp eyes tracking the chaos below.\nHardy shifted slightly, glancing at the scene unfolding beneath them.\n\"Should we intervene?\" Hardy asked, his brow furrowed in thought.\nQuispe didn’t even flinch, his expression calm. \"No need. The one we’re waiting for won’t run. That’s not her style.\"\nHardy shot him a questioning look but stayed quiet.\nThen, faintly in the distance, came a soft but eerie sound.\nQuispe’s face hardened. \"The Queen has arrived,\" he muttered, looking up to the sky. From the dark, swirling void above, a figure slowly emerged.\nWhat appeared next wasn’t what anyone would expect.\nA girl, no older than twenty, stepped forward from the shadows.\nHer deep brown skin glistened under the dim light, and her dark eyes sparkled with an unsettling intensity, like polished obsidian.\nShe wore a pristine white linen robe, delicately stitched with golden beetles, and her hair was woven into intricate braids, each one crafted with care and precision.\nIf Arix had been there, she would’ve instantly recognized the look—Ancient Egyptian attire, almost textbook-perfect. She’d seen it enough times to know.\nThe girl’s gaze landed coldly on Quispe and Hardy, who remained kneeling before her. \"Where is the one I seek?\" she asked, her voice cutting through the air like a blade.\nQuispe kept his head bowed, his voice steady and respectful. \"Your Majesty, she is on her way,\" he replied.\nThe girl’s eyes narrowed, her annoyance clear. Without warning, an invisible force slammed into Quispe, sending him crashing to the ground. He coughed up blood, his body convulsing under the weight of her psychic assault.\n\"If you fail me,\" she said, her voice dripping with icy menace, \"I will personally see to it that your entire insectoid race is wiped from existence.\"\nDespite the pain wracking his body, Quispe shakily rose to one knee, wiping the blood from his lips. \"I won’t fail you, Your Majesty. Arix is coming,\" he managed, his voice still reverent.\nThe Queen’s piercing gaze lingered on him for a moment before she closed her eyes. She then retreated into her thoughts, her posture relaxed.\nShe was ready. Ready to meet her guest—or more accurately, her prey.\nAfter a brutal fight, three mecha teams finally smashed their way through the chaos and cleared a path to freedom.\nEveryone was running, filled with excitement, but no one noticed a small figure leaping off Arix’s mecha.\nThat figure crouched alone on the broken ground, silently watching as the mechas and her team drifted farther into the distance. Only when they vanished from sight did the figure—Arix—look away.\nShe had already put the pieces together. The insectoids had stopped chasing them for a reason. It was her they were after, and she knew it all along.\nWith a bitter smile, Arix shot one last glance in the direction her teammates had gone. Then, without hesitation, she turned and sprinted the other way.\n\"Here we go.\"\nThe Egyptian woman snapped her eyes open, locking onto the figure not too far away.\nStanding behind the young woman was Quispe, who also saw her. He should’ve been relieved, but instead, a sad, bitter smile crossed his lips.\n\"Arix, you’re such a fool.\"\nBut Arix wasn’t concerned with their reactions. Her focus was on the situation at hand. She’d hoped to flee in the opposite direction, but it was clear the insectoids had forced her into a trap, steering her like a lost sheep.\nWith a sigh, she stared up at the three figures standing atop the insectoids.\n’Wait. Three?’\nFor a moment, Arix was confused.\n’There was only two before, right?’\nBefore she could make sense of it, the three figures leapt down and started walking toward her. Her attention zeroed in on the young woman in the middle.\nArix didn’t recognize her face, but the clothes? They were unmistakably familiar.\n\"Are you from Earth?\" Arix asked gently.\nThe Egyptian woman’s face went rigid for a second, and her eyes filled with a mixture of emotions. But instead of answering, she raised her hand and conjured a massive psychic barrier, sealing both of them inside.\nQuispe and Hardy, shoved back by the barrier, exchanged puzzled looks but stayed silent, waiting just outside.\nInside the bubble of psychic energy, the Egyptian woman finally spoke. \"Yes. I am the Queen of the insectoids, and I’m also from Earth. You can call me Sekhmet.\"\n\"Then why are you with the insectoids? And also...\" Arix trailed off, unsure how to phrase what she was thinking.\nThe idea of someone from Earth being the villain in all this was both awkward and disheartening.\nSekhmet didn’t seem bothered by Arix’s hesitation. She met Arix’s eyes and answered bluntly. \"Because I want to go home.\"\n\"Go home?\" Arix echoed, surprised. Then it hit her—what Sekhmet was really saying.\nOf course, not everyone was lucky enough to be sent back to their own world like she had been. Some got stuck, stranded in places they didn’t belong.\n\"Yes, home. Earth is where I truly belong. That’s where my family is—my father, my mother, my brother. I’ll do whatever it takes to get back there, even if it means destroying this entire galaxy.\" Sekhmet’s voice turned cold, like an icy breeze blowing over a frozen lake, sending a shiver down Arix’s spine.\nFor a moment, Arix didn’t know what to say. Sekhmet wasn’t bluffing, and she wasn’t crazy either. As the Queen of the insectoids, she probably had the power to pull it off.\nArix couldn’t fully grasp the idea of tearing down a whole world just to go home, but at the same time, she couldn’t judge Sekhmet for wanting it either.",

      "content": "Chapter 264: Another Transmigrator\nArix’s mind raced, but then a lightbulb went off, and her eyes lit up. \"Sekhmet, have you thought about talking to the Pontifex of the Empire of Sacred Moonlight? He might know a way to send you back to Earth.\"\nShe suggested it with confidence—after all, Arix was living proof that returning home was possible.\nBut Sekhmet just gave her a bitter smile, shaking her head. \"It’s no use. I’ve tried every method this world has to offer.\"\nArix was left speechless.\n’So, because you can’t find a way back, your plan is to destroy this world?’\n\"But,\" Sekhmet continued, her voice a little softer, \"days ago, I finally found a way.\"\n\"A way?\" Arix echoed, feeling a pit form in her stomach. She already had a sinking feeling this wasn’t going to be good news. Curiosity still got the best of her, though.\nSekhmet’s eyes flickered with a mix of emotions before her expression hardened. \"A powerful person told me that if I kill you, he can send me home.\"\nArix felt like the ground had just dropped out from under her. She almost stumbled, her breath catching in her throat as she nervously swallowed, trying to keep herself steady.\nWith a forced smile, she tried to talk her way out. \"Sekhmet, maybe he’s lying to you?\"\nSekhmet shook her head. \"I can’t tell you who he is, but I will say this: if he can’t send me back, no one can.\"\nHer eyes were filled with an apologetic sadness as she looked straight at Arix. \"So, I’m sorry, Arix. If I want to go home, I have no choice but to kill you.\"\n’What the HECK?’\nArix was so stunned she nearly blurted out the curse.\nSure, she got that Sekhmet wanted to go home, but did that really mean she had to kill HER to do it?\n\"Gosh, what kind of cosmic joke is this? Why do I have to be the target of this insane plan?\"\nArix opened her mouth to argue, to reason with Sekhmet, but before she could say a word, Sekhmet launched a sudden attack.\nArix barely managed to dodge, and the blow smashed into the ground with a deafening \"Boom!\"\nThe impact sent dust flying everywhere, and as it cleared, Arix’s eyes widened in shock. The ground where the attack landed had split wide open, forming a massive canyon right before her eyes.\n’Is this even human power?’\nArix’s heart pounded.\nThe sheer danger of the moment stirred something within the psychic world she shared with her four small companions. They flew to her side, their eyes locked on Sekhmet, looking deadly serious.\n\"How does she have the power of a god?\" Cupid asked, confusion flickering in his usually innocent eyes.\n\"Right? In smaller worlds, the strongest beings are barely demigods. Even your grandfather is a barely demigod,\" Vita added, shaking her head, equally bewildered.\n\"This isn’t right,\" Sylvana said, her voice sharp and serious as her gaze narrowed at Sekhmet.\nThe others turned to Sylvana, waiting for her to explain.\n\"A god must’ve lent her this power,\" Sylvana concluded grimly.\nEveryone went silent, their faces reflecting the same growing sense of dread.\n’Which god is after Arix this time? What did she do to keep getting tangled in their games?’\n\"What do we do? Even if we combine our powers, we’re barely at the level of a fake demigod. We can’t take her on!\" Cupid’s voice trembled with anxiety.\nBefore anyone could respond, Sekhmet began to advance toward them, her expression cold and emotionless.\n\"Arix, stop. You can’t win this fight,\" Sekhmet said flatly, like she was stating a fact. Her voice lacked any hint of malice.\nShe didn’t want to kill Arix, not really. But after a thousand years of being trapped, she was done waiting. This was her only shot at getting home.\n’Why can’t Arix see that?’\nAs Sekhmet wrestled with her thoughts, the clear reasoning in her eyes was quickly consumed by an almost fanatical determination. She unleashed her full power, rushing at Arix with everything she had.\nArix tried to dodge, but Sekhmet was too fast. A blinding blow struck her before she could even react, and she was sent hurtling through the air, crashing hard into the ground.\n\"Ugh!\" Arix coughed up blood as the pendant shattered around her neck.\n\"Arix!\" The four little ones cried out in panic, rushing to her side.\n\"She survived that?\" Sekhmet stared at her hand in surprise. That hit should’ve killed even a demigod.\nShe didn’t dwell on it for long. In a flash, she summoned a blade of light in her hand, aimed straight for Arix’s heart.\nThe four little beings didn’t waste a second. Without hesitation, they flung themselves in front of Arix, shielding her from the devastating attack.\n\"No!\" Arix gasped, trying to stop them, struggling to get to her feet.\nBut how could they, as small as they were, stand up to the power of a god?\nIn the blink of an eye, Sekhmet’s light blade shattered the psychic barrier they created and pierced through their tiny bodies.\nThe force of the blade dissolved, its power weakened before it could reach Arix. But it was too late for her companions.\nTheir small, furry forms began to fall from the sky, transparent and fading.\nArix scrambled to catch them, her heart in her throat.\nWhen she saw their fragile bodies slowly turning into light, tears welled up in her eyes, blurring her vision.\n\"Cupid! Vita! Sophia! Sylvana!\" Arix’s voice shook with fear like it had never before. She’d never been this scared. \"Are you okay? Please be okay!\"\nBut as her fingers passed through their disappearing forms, the reality sank in.\nHer fear turned into something darker, something raw and heart-wrenching.\nUncontrollable tears poured down her face, blurring the edges of the fading creatures she had fought so hard to protect.\nVita and Sophia lay motionless, their small bodies no longer stirring.\nThey hadn’t been built for battle, and now they had fallen unconscious from the sheer force of Sekhmet’s attack.\nCupid, barely hanging on, took shallow, fading breaths. His voice, weak and faint, reached Arix.\n\"Arix... run... run...\" he murmured, still trying to protect her even as the last of his strength ebbed away. But before he could say more, Cupid’s eyes closed, and he too slipped into unconsciousness.\nJust as Arix’s heart shattered, Sylvana’s voice broke through her pain.\n\"Arix.\"\nHer head snapped up, tears still streaking her face. \"Sylvana,\" she whispered, her voice raw with emotion.\nDespite the heavy wounds she had taken, Sylvana’s expression remained soft, filled with the same protective warmth Arix had always known. She glanced once more at their fallen companions before turning back to Arix.\n\"Arix, there’s one way to awaken my full power early,\" Sylvana began, her voice gentle but firm. \"But you need to be strong. Don’t grieve for me. Maybe one day, we’ll meet again.\"\n\"No!\" Arix’s voice trembled, her heart filling with panic. She already had an idea of what Sylvana was about to do. \"I don’t want this. I can’t lose you!\"\n\"Arix, be good,\" Sylvana whispered softly, her final words carrying a tender warmth. Then, in a brilliant flash of golden light, she poured her essence into Arix’s heart.\nThe moment the light surged into Arix’s body, an overwhelming force exploded from her chest. The sheer energy was so intense it sent ripples through the air around her, distorting the very space.\nFeeling the loss deep in her soul, Arix let out a scream, raw and filled with agony.\n\"No! Sylvana!\" she cried, collapsing to her knees. Her face twisted in pure despair, her heart breaking into a million pieces as the reality of what just happened hit her.\nA heart-wrenching scream tore from her throat, echoing across the battlefield, her pain too great to hold back.",

      "content": "Chapter 265: God’s Play\nNot too far away, Sekhmet stood quietly, watching Sylvana sacrifice herself. Yet, her heart—cold and hardened over centuries—felt nothing.\nFor thousands of years, Sekhmet’s hands had been stained with the blood of countless innocents, all in the name of returning home. If the person standing before her now hadn’t shared her origins, she wouldn’t have even spared a word.\nBut now, it didn’t matter. The time had come to fight on equal ground.\n\"Why? Why are you doing this to me?\" Arix’s voice, thick with grief, cut through the silence. Her eyes burned with hatred, staring at Sekhmet as if her rage alone could tear her apart.\nFor a brief moment, Sekhmet remained silent under his gaze. But then, with a steady voice, she said, \"Because I want to go home.\"\nArix’s bitter laugh filled the air, sharp and full of disbelief. \"Home? I was an idiot. You let the insectoids wreak havoc, destroy lives, and still—still I pitied you. I must be a fool.\"\nHer laughter faded into a cold sneer as she looked at her, her body tense with anger. \"If you want to go home, I’ll send you there myself—just not in the way you think. How about reincarnation?\"\nAs Arix spoke, he rose to his feet, her resolve clear.\nSekhmet didn’t flinch at her threat. Her voice was calm as she replied, \"Fine. If you can beat me, reincarnation it is.\"\nWithout hesitation, Arix charged. Her fists flew through the air, striking Sekhmet hard across the face.\nShe grunted, spitting blood, but quickly wiped her mouth and retaliated. In an instant, golden and purple lights filled the space, clashing violently.\nThe space inside the mental barrier became a battlefield where even a stray breeze could be deadly.\nBut borrowed power is never as strong as true strength. It wasn’t long before Sekhmet found herself barely hanging on.\nArix stood over her, her body trembling with fury as she raised her fist for the final blow. But just as he was about to strike, she paused, her voice cutting through the tension. \"Do you regret it?\"\nSekhmet’s face was unrecognizable, swollen and bruised. But through cracked lips, she managed a faint smile. \"No... never regretted it.\"\nArix said nothing more. She closed his eyes, then drove her fist into her chest.\nSekhmet’s body hit the snow, her brow furrowed as blood spilled from her mouth. Yet, there was no pain in her eyes—only a distant longing as she stared up at the sky, as if waiting for someone.\n\"Dad... Mom...\" she whispered softly. \"You’ve finally come for me.\"\nWith that, Sekhmet smiled, and the first snow of the season began to fall around her as she passed.\nArix, standing over her lifeless body, didn’t feel the satisfaction she expected from his revenge. Instead, she felt nothing.\nExhausted, she collapsed beside her, her eyes wandering to the snow-filled sky before they slowly closed.\nBy the time Cassian arrived, this was the scene that greeted him.\nThe girl he loved, lying in the snow, her body covered in a thin layer of white, looking as if all life had left her.\nFor a moment, Cassian—now in his grown man look—felt his composure slip. He rushed forward, pulling Arix into his arms with a sense of desperation.\nWhen he realized she was still alive, he allowed himself to breathe again.\nCassian lifted his gaze, scanning the scene around him.\nWith just a moment of closed eyes, he saw everything that had unfolded.\nThe sight of the divine power Sekhmet had used made his eyes turn icy cold, cold enough to freeze anyone who dared meet his stare.\nHe spared Arix one final glance, then let his true essence slip from the body he had reincarnated into.\nAs his physical form reverted to its true age, Cassian’s expression was briefly clouded with confusion. But the instant he noticed Arix, injured and barely conscious in his arms, panic set in.\nHis confusion melted away. With quick but careful hands, he pulled out a healing potion, gently tending to her wounds, wiping away the blood.\n...\nIn the Divine Realm\nCassian, now fully in his adult form, strode through the gates of the Divine Realm, his face set in grim determination. The guards stationed at the entrance immediately bowed in deep respect.\n\"Welcome, Your Devine Highness.\"\nCassian ignored them, his pace unbroken, eyes locked on a specific destination.\nThe guards exchanged puzzled glances, unsure of what was happening. But it wasn’t long before they heard the familiar sounds of battle ringing out from a distant part of the realm.\nThe newer guards were taken aback by the noise, but the older immortals remained unfazed, their faces showing no surprise at all.\n\"Sir,\" one of the young guards ventured cautiously, \"what’s going on? Why is there fighting in the Divine Realm?\"\nThe elder stroked his chin, a knowing smile spreading across his face. He was clearly pleased to be the one sharing the story. \"Ah, this goes back nearly ten thousand years. Back then, the Sylvana sacrificed half of her soul to save the world. Her other half was reborn—nothing too unusual there. But things got interesting when the Greater Will took pity on Sylvana and merged her sacrificed half-soul with its own essence. It chose her as the next Greater Will, overseer of the universe.\"\nThe young guard nodded, though confusion still lingered in his eyes. \"So... why is there fighting?\"\nThe elder chuckled. \"Well, that’s where it gets complicated. You see, the future Greater Will—our dear Sylvana—is painfully strict and impartial. But she hasn’t reclaimed her full place yet, and the worlds she oversees? They’ve been left without a protector. With no one keeping the people’s faith alive, the very foundation of the Divine Realm is at risk. So, the Greater Will is desperate to get Sylvana back to her rightful role.\"\nThe young guard frowned, trying to piece it together, still not seeing the connection to the fight.\nSighing, the old guard gave up on the long explanation. \"In short, the Greater Will wants Sylvana to return, but His Divine Highness, Cassian, refuses to let her be forced into it. They’ve been clashing ever since. Judging by the noise today, it seems the little Greater Will might be gaining the upper hand.\"\nThe elder’s eyes glinted with amusement as he glanced toward the source of the commotion, stroking his beard in satisfaction.\nFinally understanding, the young guard shook his head in disbelief. \"The gods really do know how to make things complicated...\"\n...\nBy the time the year wrapped up, things had taken a wild turn.\nRight after the insectoid forces crashed the new mecha tournament, they began pushing into the borders of several countries.\nNations scrambled, readying themselves for an all-out battle against this alien threat. But then, something totally unexpected happened.\nThe insectoid crown prince, Quispe, called for a ceasefire. Not only that, but he went ahead and formed the Insectoid Empire, kicking off diplomatic talks with the countries they’d just been invading.\nEveryone was on edge, suspecting some kind of trick.\nThen Quispe dropped another bombshell: a marriage alliance with the Alliance. And not just any alliance. The bride? A soldier from the Alliance’s special forces—nothing fancy there. But the wedding gifts? A star system and 66 planets.\nThat jaw-dropping gift flipped the script. Other nations, green with envy, quickly dropped their guard, eager to buddy up with the insectoids in hopes of sharing in the wealth.\nOvernight, the insectoids went from terrifying invaders to symbols of incredible fortune.\nMeanwhile, at the heart of Hecaris Hospital, Arix lay in a coma, completely unaware of the massive shift in the world around her.\nWhen she finally came to, a familiar voice was there, pulling her out of the fog.\n\"Arix, Arix...\"\nHer eyelids fluttered, and after a few moments, she opened her eyes, greeted by her mother’s relieved face.\n\"Arix, thank goodness! I was so scared,\" her mother, Fleur, sobbed, gripping her hand tightly.\n\"Mom...\" Arix’s voice came out raspy, barely above a whisper.\n\"Shh, it’s okay, you’re awake now. That’s all that matters.\" Fleur smiled through her tears, her joy clear.\nArix blinked, disoriented. \"What time is it? How did the tournament go?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 266: The End\nAt that, Fleur gave a small, exasperated laugh. \"You’re still thinking about the tournament? Don’t worry about that now. The final round’s coming up soon, but Drexel has already won three matches. We’re set to win.\"\nArix blinked again, trying to make sense of things. \"Wait... the last match? We’ve already won three?\"\n\"Yeah,\" Fleur confirmed. \"Only one more to go.\"\nArix was speechless. It felt like she’d been asleep for just a moment, but now it seemed like everything had moved on without her.\n\"Forget about the tournament for now,\" Fleur said softly, her expression growing serious. \"We really need to thank Cassian. If he hadn’t found you so quickly, we might’ve lost you.\" Her voice broke as she recalled the sight of her daughter, battered and broken.\nA wave of guilt washed over Fleur. She shouldn’t have let Arix enter the competition. If she hadn’t been so stubborn, her daughter wouldn’t be lying in a hospital bed right now.\nHer tears started again, and Arix couldn’t stand to see her mother like this. Despite her exhaustion, she pulled herself up and hugged Fleur, murmuring reassurances until the tears finally stopped.\nOnce Fleur calmed down, she flushed with embarrassment. \"Alright, alright. I’ll leave you to rest now. Tonight, I’ll bring you your favorite abalone and chicken soup.\"\n\"Thanks, Mom. See you later.\" Arix smiled as she waved goodbye, but as soon as her mother left, her smile faded. She shut her eyes and retreated into her psychic world.\nNormally, her psychic space was alive with Cupid’s playful energy, but today, it was disturbingly quiet—just a dark, cold expanse. Lonely. Empty. Like a universe stripped of its stars.\nThe three little tigers were still curled up, fast asleep, but one was missing—Sylvana, the one who had always felt like the older sister.\n\"Sylvana...\" Arix whispered, placing her hand over her chest as tears began to fall. It was her fault. If only she had been stronger, none of this would’ve happened.\nSuddenly, a voice broke through the quiet. It was both unfamiliar and strangely comforting. \"Arix, don’t be sad.\"\nStartled, Arix quickly wiped away her tears and looked toward the source of the voice. She was on guard, unsure who—or what—might be speaking to her in her psychic world. But when she saw the figure, her eyes widened in shock.\nThis person looked... unique, to say the least.\nDespite her instinct to stay cautious, it was hard to feel threatened by someone whose face was so swollen and bruised it resembled a pig’s head.\nCassian clearly knew how ridiculous he looked. Shy, he quickly turned his head to avoid meeting her eyes.\n\"Pfft!\" Arix couldn’t hold it in. She burst out laughing, the tension breaking in an instant.\nCassian froze, then sheepishly scratched the back of his head. If his goofy appearance could make her smile, then he didn’t mind looking silly at all.\nFeeling more at ease now, Arix’s curiosity only grew. \"Who are you? How are you here?\" She knew there was something familiar about him, but his face was so puffed up that she couldn’t quite place him.\nCassian shook his head, choosing not to reveal his name just yet. Instead, he gently said, \"Arix, don’t be sad. Sylvana isn’t gone. You’ll see her again when you return to the Divine Realm.\"\n\"The Divine Realm?\" Arix’s eyes narrowed with suspicion. The last time she crossed paths with gods, one had tried to kill her.\nNoticing the anger brewing in her gaze, Cassian panicked and waved his hands frantically. \"Wait, Arix! I’m not the one who tried to kill you! I’ve been protecting you this whole time, I swear!\" To prove it, he sent a beam of light toward her, restoring the Moon Goddess’s protective mark on her chest.\nArix looked down, watching as the mark returned to its full strength. Slowly, she blinked, realizing she had misunderstood him.\n\"Thank you. I... I really did get it wrong,\" she said, a bit embarrassed, scratching her nose in an attempt to brush off the awkwardness.\nCassian just smiled, not holding it against her for a second. \"It’s nothing. Really. But I can’t stay much longer. I have to go soon. Don’t worry, though—Cupid and the others will wake up soon.\"\n\"Okay. Thanks again,\" Arix replied, her voice sincere.\nCassian smiled softly. \"It’s what I should do. But yeah, I really have to go now,\" he said, stealing one last glance at her before turning to leave.\nArix smiled, waving as he walked away, but just as he was about to disappear, she called out, \"Cassian?\"\nHe paused for a moment but then hurriedly kept walking, his steps a little awkward, as if he didn’t quite know how to react.\nWatching him leave, Arix’s smile deepened. It seemed like something had just clicked for her.\nEven all grown up, Cassian was still as adorable as ever.\nAfter learning that Sylvana was safe, Arix finally felt the weight lift off her chest. She remembered the ongoing tournament and wondered how things were going on that front.\nWith that thought, Arix checked on the three little tigers, making sure they were fine before leaving her psychic world.\nAs soon as she was back, she eagerly opened the live stream and clicked into the new mecha tournament’s channel. She tuned in just in time—the fifth match was about to begin.\nSix mecha teams stood outside the hotel, waiting to board the ship that would take them to the battleground.\n’Wait, what? Six teams?’\nArix’s brain nearly fried. She looked carefully at the video feed and, to her shock, saw that the extra team was being led by none other than Hardy!\n’Are the insectoids really this bold now? Do they think everyone was blind?’\nArix frowned and quickly typed a message in the chat.\n[MechaMonster]: Report! There’s an insectoid in the third team!\nArix knew that there were officials watching the live stream, so she hoped her message would catch the admin’s attention. But after waiting a while, her message seemed to sink like a stone—no reaction at all.\nArix’s eyes darkened, and she started to wonder if there were insectoid spies among the admins. In the past, whenever an insectoid was spotted, the chat would explode like water hitting hot oil.\nThinking for a moment, she sent another message.\n[MechaMonster]: There’s really an insectoid in the third team! Seriously!\nBut as soon as she sent it, the chat’s viewers started to get annoyed and fired back one by one.\n[NotHereForDrama]: Ugh, give it a rest! We all know there’s an insectoid. You think we’re blind?\n[DudeBro420]: Yeah, no kidding. Does this idiot still think insectoids are like they used to be?\n[MissInternetStar]: Bet this person’s fresh out of the village. Probably doesn’t know insectoids and humans have been chill for a while now.\n...\nArix stared at the comments, recognizing every word but failing to understand what they meant when put together.\n’What do they mean, insectoids and humans had been living in peace? And what do they mean by insectoids aren’t like they used to be anymore? Have they evolved into some royal insectoids or something?’\nBefore Arix could wrap her head around it, she got kicked out of the live stream by the admin.\nFurious, she clicked to see the reason and was greeted with a message that shattered her worldview.\n[Admin]: You are disrupting the peaceful relationship between humans and insectoids. You’ve been removed from the stream. Further violations will result in a report to the authorities.\nArix: ...\n’Seriously? I just took a nap, and now it felt like I’ve woken up in an alternate universe. Is this some parallel world where humans and insectoids live in harmony? Or what else?’\nWith her lips twitching in disbelief, Arix opened up Interstellarnet Headlines and started searching for recent news about insectoids.\nWhen she saw the results, her face quickly shifted to a extremely shocked one.\nBreaking! Shocking Secrets Between the Insectoid Crown Prince and His Mother!\nAfter the Crown Prince’s Lavish Dowry, Second Prince Hardy Becomes the Nation’s Sweetheart!\nInsectoid Birth Rate Plummets: Royal Family Offers Rewards to Encourage Growth!\nHeartless! Corrupt Merchants Caught Selling Rare Materials Harvested from Insectoid Corpses—Made Over 8 Billion!\nInsectoids Are Worth a Fortune: Beware of Traffickers! Insectoid Tourists, Please Stay Safe!\n...\nArix read through all the headlines patiently. Afterward, she sighed, feeling a mix of emotions.\nIt turned out the world had already achieved peace.\nMaybe it was time for her story to come to an end too.\nThe End\nThe Novel will be updated first on this website.
