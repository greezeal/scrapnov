      "content": "Chapter 1 - 1: Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, Heart of Woods Pet Beast Breeding Base!\nLinzhou City.\nThe bus traveled down the road, with Su Ping sitting by the window, gazing out at the familiar yet magical world unfolding before him.\nHaving been in this world for so many years, Su Ping had adapted to it.\nIt was a world where humans and Pet Beasts coexisted, with a structure somewhat similar to the one before he crossed over.\nHowever, in addition to the realms of humans, there were also wildernesses and domains occupied by Ferocious Beasts, serving as forbidden zones for humans.\nAnd humans, upon reaching the age of 18, could undergo the awakening of a Beast Tamer.\nThey could awaken their Beast Taming Space as well as their innate Talent.\nThen contract Pet Beasts and become Beast Tamers.\nA month had passed since he had graduated from high school and completed the awakening.\nAnd now, he was already considered a prospective Beast Tamer, with his own Beast Taming Space and Talent.\nThinking of this, Su Ping's view seemed to double, and his Talent along with that cramped, claustrophobic Beast Taming Space entered his perception.\n[Pet Beast Home: The Beast Taming Space can take in uncontracted wild Pet Beasts, but their Level must not exceed one's own.]\nA very ordinary Talent, though uncommon, its effect was also average.\nBut something else quickly appeared before Su Ping's eyes.\nCompared to the seemingly lackluster Talent of Pet Beast Home, this other thing that emerged from his consciousness was what Su Ping had always been curious about.\nThis had also appeared in his mind after completing his awakening a month ago:\n[Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas: Transformed from the world's Origin, a Catalog that can accommodate all Pet Beast forms. Illuminating, replenishing, and perfecting the Catalog will grant rewards from the world's Origin feedback!]\n(Note: Only Pet Beasts that meet the conditions can be included in the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas.)\n(Note: Pet Beasts have corresponding Evolutionary Bodies. The higher the quality of the pet and the more Pet Beasts there are, the faster the Catalog can be replenished and perfected.)\nWith a thought, Su Ping directly opened the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas.\nWithin this Catalog, all kinds of Pet Beasts were listed, but the Catalog was gray and white, obviously unlit. However, he had waited for a month already, and now he was in no hurry.\nWith that thought, Su Ping looked expectantly out the bus window.\nAs one of the few first-tier cities in the country, although it couldn't compare with the Magic Capital and the Imperial Capital, Linzhou City was bustling with activity.\nMost importantly, it had a huge natural forest park, the Lingxi River, West Dragon Lake, and other places with abundant resources of wild Pet Beasts.\nEven some Pet Beasts were unique to Linzhou.\nAnd here in the suburbs, relatively secluded and quiet, a sign soon came into Su Ping's view:\n'Heart of Woods Pet Beast Breeding Base'\n\"Passengers, please note that the Lingxi River station is approaching. Passengers getting off here, please prepare to disembark.\"\nListening to the bus stop announcement, Su Ping quickly stood up, walked down from the bus, and came before the grand estate.\nSu Ping shook his head and sighed.\nWhat a pity!\nWhat a pity it was a world dominated by Controlling Beasts. Otherwise, with such a large piece of land on the outskirts of his city, if it were priced as in his previous life, such a big Pet Beast Breeding Base in Linzhou City could have allowed him to live comfortably for a lifetime.\nIn this world, all industries related to Controlling Beasts were the most important and expensive.\nOf course, even now it wasn't bad. As long as one didn't touch those Advanced Level Controlling Beasts and resources, one could still live without worry about food and clothing.\nBut having come to this world, if he didn't experience its wonders, how could Su Ping be content?\nWith that thought, Su Ping took out his phone again and opened up the message left by his father, Su Anyong:\n\"Son, you've come of age now, and you've awakened your Talent to become a qualified prospective Beast Tamer. Since that's true, I can safely pass on the mantle to you!\nCome back, come back to Heart of Woods, and together let's make it the best Forest Wolf breeding base in Jianghai Province, or even the whole country!\"\nSo, Su Ping returned.\nIt's not that he fully believed his father's words. Mainly, he was interested in exploring his own Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas.\nOver the month, he had encountered many Pet Beasts in Linzhou City, yet none met the requirements to be recorded in the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas to light up, complete, or perfect the Catalog.\nIn this world, becoming a Beast Tamer wasn't just about awakening your Talent or forming a contract with your first Pet Beast.\nA true, qualified Beast Tamer had to be acknowledged by the Beast Master Association after participating in the triennial Beast Tamer assessment competition.\nAfter graduation, talented Beast Tamer prospects could choose to continue their studies at higher education institutions or be invested in by some factions.\nOf course, both of those paths were challenging.\nAnd clearly, their family's breeding base was not among that list.\nIn fact, it was just a small-scale breeding base specializing in Forest Wolves.\nIt was somewhat noteworthy that, because of its location in the suburbs of Linzhou City, and because Su Ping's grandfather had indeed been prosperous—a Monarch Level Beast Tamer who had sacrificed himself to defend against Beast Tides—they had managed to hold on to this large breeding base and a sizeable rented plot nearby.\nShaking his head, Su Ping took out the key and unlocked the gate.\nThe breeding base was vast.\nBeyond the several square kilometers of forest that provided a playground and rest area for the Forest Wolves, there were their living quarters, the constant temperature and humidity birthing rooms, testing labs, control rooms, Magic Potion workshops, medical rooms, and many other facilities that made up the estate.\nFurthermore, at the back, the Lingxi River flowed by, originating from West Dragon Lake.\nHis father had always been clamoring to use such great resources to develop some Water Element Pet Beasts, but he'd forget all about it the next day.\nWalking straight into the house, Su Ping gazed at the empty living room, and a vague, unpleasant premonition rose in his heart.\n\"Dad!\"\n\"Su Anyong!\"\n\"Where are you?!\"\nThe empty living room echoed back Su Ping's voice.\nThen, he approached the sofa and saw a piece of paper on the coffee table. Su Ping's mouth twitched rapidly as he quickly picked it up. Sure enough, the familiar handwriting of Su Anyong was clear:\n\"Son, your Second Granduncle mentioned introducing a stepmother to you. He wants me to go to Beihai City to check it out. You're an adult now, a real man!\nSo, it's time for you to take on the responsibilities at home. The future of Heart of Woods is in your hands! You grew up here; you should know how to operate things.\nDon't worry about the rest. The feeder has enough food for the little ones for two months, and Old Sha is here to help you get settled during this time.\nOh, and you probably haven't formed a contract with your first Pet Beast, have you? I've been picky and have chosen one for you. It's in the hatching room.\nCall me if there's anything, and as long as it's not about money, your dad will figure out a way for you. That's it.The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\n—Loving father, Su Anyong.\"\nLooking at the familiar handwriting, Su Ping was speechless.\nLuckily, he had long since grown accustomed to his unreliable father's behavior.\nSuch a large breeding base, if he'd paid a bit more attention to it, wouldn't have ended up like this.\nNevertheless, Su Ping was quite intrigued. His unreliable father had actually remembered that he hadn't contracted his first Pet Beast! He wondered what kind of creature Su Anyong could have possibly picked out for him after such careful selection.\nMoving quickly, Su Ping took only a couple of steps to reach the nearby constant temperature and humidity birthing and hatching room.\nHe looked at the little creature inside the box.",

      "content": "Chapter 2 - 2: The Mutant Poison Attribute Forest Wolf, Eye of Truth!\nThis is a little wolf cub.\nSu Ping wasn't surprised.\nThe Heart of Woods is mainly used for cultivating Forest Wolves.\nHowever, Su Ping's brows quickly furrowed, as he could tell at a glance that this little wolf cub seemed to be no ordinary Forest Wolf.\nForest Wolves have the Racial Potential to reach the Elite Level.\nOn Blue Star, Pet Beasts, Beast Tamers, and resources are categorized as Ordinary, Elite, Commander, Monarch, Emperor, Saint, Legend, and Myth.\nMoreover, each Pet Beast has corresponding Evolution methods and pathways that have been discovered by Beast Tamers.\nGenerally speaking, the Racial Potential detected in a Pet Beast before it evolves is its highest potential for natural growth.\nIn other words, without the means and resources to evolve a Pet Beast, the natural growth limit for a Forest Wolf would normally be the Elite Level.\nBut as the world is full of wonders, there are also some relatively rare occurrences, such as bloodline Mutation.\nGenerally, the fur of Forest Wolf cubs is mostly gray-yellow, only turning into a bluish-green color during the Growth Period or upon reaching adulthood.\nBut this little cub lying in the automatic feeder was completely different.\nIts body was a lush green, and at first glance, it didn't even seem like a living creature, but more like a carving made of jade.\nThe round, pitch-black eyes looked at Su Ping, who was observing from outside the box, and made a WHINING sound.\nSu Ping immediately felt amused and called his father right away.\n\"Hello, Su Ping? Are you back home?\" came the hearty voice of his father, Su Anyong.\n\"Yeah, what's with this little wolf?\"\nSu Ping didn't bother to ask what his father was thinking, to just hand over the cultivation base to him like that. Nor did he care that his father had left without a word to find him a stepmother.\nHe was used to his father's ways all these years.Google seaʀᴄh NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\n\"HEH HEH, could I possibly cheat my own son? This little wolf has a mutated bloodline; its Wood Attribute bloodline has purified and gained a Poison Attribute. If it's trained this way, it might possess both Wood and Poison Attributes in the future. Someone offered twelve million, and I didn't sell. How could I? My good son has awakened as a Beast Tamer and needs his first Contracted Beast. How could a mere twelve million compare to a father's doting affection...\"\nSu Ping promptly hung up the phone, but his eyes had already lit up.\nA Poison Attribute mutated Forest Wolf? This is indeed interesting.\nWhile the Poison Attribute was not as rare and precious as those with Spirit, space, or time Attributes, it was still quite uncommon.\nHis father had actually been reliable for once!\nThinking this, Su Ping didn't hesitate. Most of his classmates from the same graduating class had already completed contracts with their first Contracted Beast; only he had still been indecisive.\nThe Forest Wolf was a creature he had been familiar with since he was young. A mutated Poison Attribute Forest Wolf was undoubtedly an excellent choice.\nThe Soul Contract slowly connected with the little wolf cub in front of him.\nThe cub, which was obviously just born not long ago, did not resist at all.\nIn less than ten minutes, Su Ping opened his eyes and looked at the little one in front of him.\nAt the same time, inside the incubator, through the glass cover, the little one also opened its eyes and looked at Su Ping.\nThe moment their gazes met, an indescribable sense of closeness seemed to emanate from deep within their souls.\nA connection through a Soul Contract is the closest relationship possible.\nAnd the moment Su Ping established the contract with the little wolf, its body visibly became a bit stronger.\nThis is the bond and connection between a Beast Tamer and their Pet Beast.\nA Beast Tamer's spiritual power can feedback into the Pet Beast's improvement and growth; likewise, a Pet Beast's breakthrough and enhancement in Realm will also raise the Beast Tamer's Realm through the soul link.\nThe two are truly complementary to one another.\nSu Ping reached out and took the little wolf from the constant temperature box. Its emerald green body was incredibly soft, yet it lacked the warmth of living creatures, feeling somewhat cool instead.\n\"Seeing as you're like this all over, let's call you Xiao Qing.\"\nSu Ping was never good at naming. His Pet Beasts were unique to him, so whatever name they were given was just an identifier. Clearly, the little wolf in his arms was indifferent to its name, opening its milky-scented mouth as if to respond to Su Ping:\n\"AWOOO... WHIMPER WHIMPER WHIMPER...\"\nThis call of the bloodline was slightly strange due to its undeveloped vocalization.\nSu Ping smiled faintly.\nHowever, at that moment, he suddenly paused.\nIn his mind, the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, which had not changed since his previous awakening, slowly opened without his control.\nWith the rustling sound of flipping pages, it quickly locked onto a particular image!\nThe creature in this picture was none other than an adult, a perfectly standard Forest Wolf.\nAt the same time, on the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, a line of text appeared before Su Ping's eyes.\n[Catalog 'Forest Wolf' illuminated, current Catalog Level: 1, Origin Reward acquired: Eye of Truth]\n[Eye of Truth (Beast Tamer Ability): Allows the user to see the specific Level, Skills, and Race of Pet Beasts and Ferocious Beasts through spiritual power.]\nHuh?!\nSu Ping hadn't even had time to react when he felt a surge of information being directly poured into his mind from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas.\nThe next moment, Su Ping saw a line of text appear on Xiao Qing in his arms:\n[Variant Forest Wolf (Contracted)]\n[Attribute: Wood, Poison]\n[Current Level: Ordinary First Rank]\n[Racial Potential: Elite Tenth Stage]\n[Skills: Sunlight Absorption (Beginner)]\nEye of Truth?\nIsn't this one of the Talents that can be awakened after a Beast Tamer's awakening?\nBut the problem is, each Beast Tamer only has this one opportunity to awaken their inherent Talented Ability, right?\nIsn't my Talent 'Pet Beast Home'?\nSu Ping was not surprised by the illumination of the Forest Wolf in the Catalog due to the contract, but the reward for this illumination left him completely stunned.\nAlthough it was true that the Eye of Truth wasn't considered an earth-shattering Beast Tamer Talent, in fact, Eye of Truth, alongside Telepathic Communication and Rapid Recovery, was one of the three most common Beast Tamer Talents, accounting for nearly fifty percent of all Talents.\nBut no matter how common, this was still given for free!\nBeast Tamer Talents—these were genuine Abilities with no other means of acquisition.\nSu Ping originally imagined that the rewards from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas would at most be some special resources, possibly some special Pet Beast Evolution schemes, or other things.\nBut he truly did not expect that this first illuminated reward would bring him such a big surprise.\nWith that thought, Su Ping, while stroking Xiao Qing in his arms, couldn't wait to look at the illuminated 'Forest Wolf' entry in the Catalog.",

      "content": "Chapter 3 - 3 Forest Wolf Catalog, Magic Potion: 'Heart of Woods\nAs Su Ping's gaze focused, the only illuminated pattern on the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas slowly enlarged, appearing before his eyes.\n[Catalog: Forest Wolf]\n[A wolf tribe proficient in using Wood Attributes, with extremely strong Life Force. An average adult Forest Wolf is of Elite Level, with Skills such as Sunlight Absorption, Vine Strangling, Self-Healing, and Accelerated Growth.]\n[Current Catalog Level: 1 (300/500)]\nKnown Evolutionary Atlas, special cultivation:\n[Not discovered yet]\nPreferences, habits:\n[Enjoys basking in the sun, playing in the woods, moving in groups, and has stronger combat ability in daylight or within forests.]\nRecord log:\n[Encountered and made contact with a Forest Wolf of a Poison Attribute mutation lineage; intimacy met the requirements. Catalog Experience +300!]\n[This Forest Wolf is a special mutant. For every day spent with it, Catalog Experience +5! Each day of companionship offers a certain chance of discovering the reasons for the bloodline mutation. Alternatively, a large amount of this Catalog's Experience can be consumed to analyze the mutation reason.]\n[Daily, Catalog Experience can be gained based on the number of interactions with such creatures and their level. It can also be gained by enhancing the biological abilities of creatures that meet the intimacy standard, thereby perfecting the Catalog and upgrading its level.]\nLooking at the Catalog of the Forest Wolf, which had analyzed it quite thoroughly, Su Ping blinked once more.\nThis Catalog can actually be upgraded.\nAnd there are rewards for each upgrade?\nThinking of the Eye of Truth he had just discovered, Su Ping's eyes lit up.\nIt was clear in the Catalog's records that the more you interact with the creatures in the Catalog, and the higher their quality, the more Catalog Experience you obtain.\nIt's just unknown whether this interaction will count if they are not one's Contracted Beasts.\nMoreover, the unlocking of the Forest Wolf Catalog happened after he established a Soul Contract with Xiao Qing.\nCould it be that to illuminate the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas with its numerous Pet Beast Catalogs, one must contract each one individually?\nThat's obviously impossible.\nAfter all, a Beast Tamer's Contracted Beast slots are limited.\nEach Beast Tamer only gained one Pet Beast slot per Great Realm breakthrough.\nIn other words, Su Ping could only contract a second Pet Beast once he broke through to the Elite Level himself.\nHowever, upon scrutinizing the Catalog again carefully, especially the text in the last line of the record, Su Ping's gaze locked on.\nIntimacy!\nIndeed, in the half-month since my graduation from Linzhou City, I've come into contact with quite a few Pet Beasts.\nNone could light up the Catalog, and the reason must be this so-called intimacy!\nThis means that as long as I frequently accompany these Pet Beasts—even if they aren't my Contracted Beasts—they can be included in the Catalog and count towards its upgrade requirements, provided their intimacy is high enough.\nWith this realization, he finally recognized that the Pet Beast Breeding Base his unreliable father left him might actually have some value and use!\nImmediately, the idea of going on an adventure was cast to the winds from Su Ping's mind.\nAdventure? What joy could it hold compared to the delight of cultivation here?\nRecalling his understanding of the Forest Wolf and the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base over the years, Su Ping was invigorated.\nCradling Xiao Qing, he returned to the living quarters and rummaged through Su Anyong's room. After a long search, he finally found what he wanted to see.\nIt was an ancient book with yellowed pages.\nIn this era, such ancient books were obviously rare. However, according to his father, it was the Su Family heirloom and the key reason why the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base had persisted until today.\nPreviously, his father had put on a show, refusing to let Su Ping see it until he had turned eighteen, awakened his Talent, and become a prospective Beast Tamer.\nNow, this thing was tossed under a cabinet, evidently not treasured or carefully preserved.\nThe book title was quite lengthy:\n\"Forest Wolf Breeding and Training Manual with the 'Heart of Woods' Magic Potion Recipe\"\nThe origin of their family's Pet Beast Breeding Base lay within this.\nAccording to his dad, this was also his grandfather's lifelong research.\nMagic Potions were concoctions made from various resources combined according to a recipe, and the vast majority were for Pet Beasts to consume.\n'Heart of Woods' was clearly the same.\nThe effects of Magic Potions varied: some accelerated Pet Beasts' growth, some enhanced their Realm, others restored their energy, some caused them to evolve, and some enabled them to learn a certain Skill.\nAmong these types of Magic Potions, those that could induce Evolution in Pet Beasts were undoubtedly the most precious—no need to elaborate on that.\nBeyond that were Magic Potions that enabled Pet Beasts to learn Skills.\nAnd the 'Heart of Woods' Magic Potion recipe from this ancient book was just that.\n'Heart of Woods' was a Skill. Although not a 'Super-Rank' Skill with mighty effects comparable to forbidden spells from games in his previous world, it was still quite remarkable.\nOn Blue Star, Pet Beast Skills were generally divided into ordinary Skills and Super-Rank Skills.\nAlthough 'Heart of Woods' was an ordinary Skill, it was an extremely rare ability, sometimes even more useful than certain offensive Super-Rank Skills!\nIts effect was actually quite simple: all Wood Attribute Skills of the Pet Beast were passively enhanced. When injured or its energy was depleted, it could actively absorb nutrients from trees and plants for Rapid Recovery.\nThis ability, combined with a Forest Wolf's Skills, was an unmatched treasure if used in battle in a forest or on the plains!\nAcross the entire Blue Star, not many Wood Element Pet Beasts naturally possessed the 'Heart of Woods' Skill.\nWere it not for the fact that his family's 'Heart of Woods' Magic Potion recipe had an exceedingly low chance of successful awakening—with only a few successes over decades—and was exclusively for Forest Wolf use, this recipe alone, regardless of its monetary value, might have contended for the top prize at the Breeder Association's annual Breeder Research Competition, achieving nationwide fame!\nHowever, since it was the family heirloom, Su Ping, having already decided to run his family's Pet Beast Breeding Base well, naturally had to master it.\nHe quickly skipped over the information about Forest Wolf breeding, which he was already familiar with, and carefully read the 'Heart of Woods' recipe.ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\n'Raw materials: three sections of hollow willow branches, one Wood Spirit herb, three drops of hundred-herb juice, one nectar-absorbing bee stinger.'\n'Production method: The hollow willow branches must be pounded by hand for 30 minutes over fire until they become crushed. Then, 100ml of clear water and one drop of the hundred-herb juice are added. Continue to pound by hand for another 30 minutes until it becomes paste-like. After that, add another drop of the hundred-herb juice and one Wood Spirit herb. Continue to pound by hand for another 30 minutes until it becomes a pulp. Then, add the nectar-absorbing bee stinger. Finally, pound it into a concentrated liquid before cooling for over six hours to form a jelly-like state. Only then is it considered successfully made.'\n'Effect: After consumption by a Forest Wolf, there is approximately a one percent chance of learning the rare Skill: Heart of Woods, and a chance to raise the Pet Beast's Level.'\n'The better the innate Talents of the Forest Wolf, the higher the success rate.'\nAfter reviewing the 'Heart of Woods' recipe from beginning to end, Su Ping let out a sigh.\nDamn, no wonder such a rare and precious Skill Magic Potion recipe has been well preserved by our family, yet nobody knows or seems to care about it.\nIt's bad enough that it's only for Forest Wolves, but this success rate is just too low, isn't it?\nInstead of spending time researching and trying this, wouldn't it be much better to directly contract a Pet Beast with Commander-level or Monarch-level Racial Potential?\nBut it's still better than nothing, I suppose.\nShaking his head, Su Ping was just about to stand up when he was suddenly taken aback.\nAt this moment, the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas in his mind started flipping pages on its own, and the Forest Wolf Catalog appeared before his eyes.\nFeedback from a Catalog entry then emerged in Su Ping's mind:\n[Discovery of a 'Forest Wolf' special cultivation method: 'Heart of Woods' Magic Potion.]\n[Detected that the 'Heart of Woods' Magic Potion recipe is in an incomplete state. Do you wish to spend 285 Forest Wolf Catalog Experience to perfect the 'Heart of Woods' Magic Potion recipe?]\nSu Ping couldn't help but open his mouth wide, his eyes revealing an incredulous surge of elation.",

      "content": "Chapter 4 - 4: The Perfect Recipe! Forest Wolf Breaks Through Racial Limits\nThe Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas actually has this effect?!\nSu Ping could hardly believe it! But even with a disposition tempered by two lifetimes, his palm, gripping the ancient tome, couldn't help but tremble slightly from the intensity of his excitement.\nPerfect the Magic Potion recipe!\nSu Ping didn't even need to think before he immediately confirmed his choice in the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas's prompt!\nIt was clear that the Experience Points for the Forest Wolf Catalog were also very important. And each time it leveled up, it would give Su Ping, the owner of the Catalog, rewards beyond his imagination. For instance, after activating it, the Beast Tamer Talented Ability: Eye of Truth, was granted. However, Catalog Experience could be earned by spending time with the Forest Wolf, nurturing it, evolving it, and even discovering mutant species like Xiao Qing.\nHowever, the Heart of Woods, as the primary legacy of their family's cultivation base, had an impact on the Forest Wolf that was nothing short of revolutionary.\nIn an instant, Su Ping saw that the Forest Wolf Catalog, which had been mostly illuminated, dimmed considerably. The next moment, a blank entry below the Forest Wolf Catalog changed. It was the \"Known Evolutionary Atlas, Special Cultivation\" entry. Previously, this entry was blank, but now, an addition appeared:\n[\"Heart of Woods\" Magic Potion production: Upon consumption by a Forest Wolf, it can awaken the treasured Skill \"Heart of Woods.\" The effects of other Level upgrades are unknown. The production method is as follows...]\nSeeing the change appear in the Forest Wolf Catalog, Su Ping let out a long breath, his eyes shining radiantly, filled with anticipation and excitement.\nIndeed! This time, the Forest Wolf Catalog's description of the Heart of Woods Magic Potion made no mention of the *chance* to awaken the Skill \"Heart of Woods.\"\nThe implication was obvious.\nHowever, what gave Su Ping a bit of a headache was the recipe perfected by the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas. A new ingredient had been added to the recipe.\nIt wasn't that this new ingredient was particularly expensive. Even though his old man was unreliable, their family's large cultivation base didn't require rent and had likely amassed some savings over the years. The primary source of these savings, however, wasn't from selling well-cultivated Forest Wolves for a high price. Instead, it was purely from renting out a large vacant lot connected to their cultivation base to their neighbor, the Yun Tian Pet Beast Combat Resort.\nThe reason Su Ping looked troubled was because of this one addition to the perfected recipe. Its name was 'Wolf Tobacco'. At first glance, it seemed related to the Forest Wolf, but in reality, there was no connection. This was purely because when lit, the plant produced a dense smoke, like a beacon fire, and the smell...\nIronically, this Wolf Tobacco was extremely abundant, growing wild all over the place in some areas. Often, Fire-type Pet Beasts or Beast Tamers would ignore the law and engage in Pet Beast battles in forests, igniting wildfires. For the firefighters from the Safety Bureau responsible for extinguishing those fires, the most critical task was to have their own Pet Beasts take precautions against this Wolf Tobacco. In the history of Dragon Nation, there had been many cases where Water-type Pet Beasts, particularly those extinguishing wildfires, were choked to death by the noxious fumes erupting from burning Wolf Tobacco.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ NovᴇlFirenᴇt\nThinking of this, Su Ping silently mourned the brave little Pet Beast heroes who died extinguishing forest fires and protecting wild Pet Beasts. He also condemned the Beast Tamers who carelessly used Fire-type Pet Beasts for battles in forests.\nIt was precisely because this Wolf Tobacco was largely useless, had a terribly pungent smell, and its smoke could easily cause hallucinations when burned that Wolf Tobacco had such a bad reputation. Moreover, no one had discovered any other uses for it—though, perhaps someone had and simply hadn't made it public. Therefore, Su Ping was somewhat skeptical about whether this Wolf Tobacco could truly perfect the Heart of Woods Magic Potion.\nHowever, trusting his Golden Finger and the undeniably real Eye of Truth he now possessed, Su Ping chose to believe.\nFull of anticipation, he arrived at the door of another building in the base.\nThe Magic Potion Workshop.\nThis place, within the entire Heart of Wood Cultivation Base, had the most surveillance. After all, the resources needed for Magic Potions were extremely precious, and the auxiliary equipment for their creation was incredibly valuable. This was also the place his father had strictly forbidden him from approaching before he came of age. But now...\nHowever, just as he was about to step into the workshop, a huge shadow suddenly appeared behind him. Xiao Qing, nestled in his arms, immediately tensed.\nSu Ping whipped his head around. The next moment, a massive dark shadow pounced, knocking him onto the soft grass. A warm, damp sensation immediately spread across his cheek.\nSu Ping didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He looked at the massive, cyan-blue wolf sprawled on top of him, enthusiastically licking his face to show affection, and quickly said, \"Alright, alright...\"\nStruggling to his feet, Su Ping wiped the drool from his face. He then fondly stroked the soft fur under the chin of the giant wolf—who was nearly as tall as he was—and asked, \"Old Sha, have there been any problems these past two days while Dad's been away? Are the little ones alright?\"\n\"AWOOO...\"\nThe giant Forest Wolf named Old Sha shook his head.\nOld Sha was a Forest Wolf raised by Su Ping's grandfather and, strictly speaking, was of the same generation as his father. Although Old Sha hadn't formed a Soul Contract with his grandfather or father, over the years, he had become the Su Family's closest kin.\nAs a Pet Beast's strength increased, so did its intelligence. Old Sha was clearly no exception. He was the only Forest Wolf in the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base that had broken through his race limit and reached the Commander Level. He was also, over many years, the sole Wolf King of the Forest Wolves in the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base. With Old Sha around, the mischievous and lazy Forest Wolves would behave and listen obediently. This was the main reason Su Anyong had been able to save money by not hiring others for help, managing everything himself all these years.\nLooking at Old Sha before him, Su Ping activated his Eye of Truth. Old Sha could sense Su Ping using an ability on him but didn't resist at all. It was precisely this trust that allowed Su Ping to see some of Old Sha's Abilities:\n[Forest Wolf (Wild)]\n[Current Level: Commander First Stage]\n[Racial Potential: Elite Tenth Stage]\n[Skills: Sunlight Absorption (Perfection), Vine Strangling (Proficient), Self-Healing (Proficiency), Accelerated Growth (Proficient), Wolf King Majesty (Beginner)]\nOld Sha's panel was relatively normal. His Skill training levels were standard, except for Sunlight Absorption, which had astonishingly reached the Perfection Level. Clearly, Old Sha's ability to break through his race limit was related to this Perfection-Level Sunlight Absorption and his status as Wolf King. He must have had his own fortuitous encounters in his early years.\nHowever, before Su Ping could dwell on it further, a new message appeared in the log of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas's Forest Wolf Catalog:\n[Discovered and interacted with a Forest Wolf that has surpassed its Racial Potential limit. Affinity requirements met. Catalog Level Experience +100!]\n[This Forest Wolf is a powerful individual. For each subsequent day spent with it, Forest Wolf Catalog Experience +2!]\nSu Ping was startled, then a smile touched his lips.\nIndeed, returning to Heart of Woods to inherit the family business was an absolutely correct decision.",

      "content": "Chapter 5 - 5: Making Magic Potion, Yun Tian Pet Beast Resort\nOld Sha did not stop Su Ping from entering the Magic Potion Workshop.\nWhen Su Anyong left, he had told him that from now on, this Heart of Woods Pet Beast Breeding Base would be under the command of this little master.\nOld Sha, having watched Su Ping grow up, was the elder who doted on him the most.\nThe Magic Potion Workshop could be said to be the cleanest place in the entire estate, with spotless white walls, floors, and ceilings.\nHowever, the smell of disinfectant in the air made him frown. Xiao Qing, perched on his shoulder and clinging to his collar, also sneezed several times due to the irritating smell.\nAfter gently rubbing the somewhat uncomfortable Xiao Qing, Su Ping finally placed Xiao Qing into his own Beast Taming Space.\nInside the Beast Taming Space, a Beast Tamer's spiritual power provided comfort. This allowed a Pet Beast to remain in a comfortable state at all times and also accelerated its energy and injury recovery.\nAfter all, Xiao Qing was still rather young.\nHandling some equipment he had seen and learned about at school but never actually operated, Su Ping expertly opened the cold storage room.\nAs expected, given that these were ingredients for the Heart of Woods Magic Potion, even though his father was unreliable, he had definitely tried making it many times over the years. Consequently, there were still some ingredients left in the cold storage room, which made things much easier.\nSu Ping's eyes lit up. Then, under Old Sha's astonished gaze, he quickly ran out of the Magic Potion Workshop and patted Old Sha, saying, \"Old Sha, is there Wolf Tobacco growing near the Lingxi River behind our base?\"\nOld Sha nodded. Then, he watched as his young master sprinted towards the Lingxi River area behind the base.\nOld Sha didn't dare to overthink it and quickly chased after him.\nThis little rascal had just returned; how could he already be such a handful?\nWolf Tobacco? Wasn't that stuff even smellier than the dung produced by those little creatures in the forest?\nOld Sha's speed was much faster than Su Ping's.\nWhile Su Ping was studying in Linzhou City—perhaps because he was a person with memories of two lives—he had been an undeniable top student in the meditation course among his peers.\nAfter awakening his Beast Taming Space and Talent, he had now reached the Ordinary Fourth Stage Beast Tamer. However, his speed was still far behind Old Sha, who had reached the Commanding Rank.\nSeeing Old Sha catch up, Su Ping deftly grabbed Old Sha's mane and flipped onto his back.\nTheir breeding base wasn't small, and it was still some distance to the banks of the Lingxi River across the entire grounds.\n\"AWOO...\"\nRidden by the young master he had watched grow up, Old Sha felt a surge of excitement and let out a resounding howl.\nIn the suburbs, the sudden wolf howl was indeed extremely loud and piercing.\nIt seemed the Wolf King's howl had been sensed.\nInstantly, from the vast woodlands of the base, a chorus of howls rose in response.\nObviously, even though it was on the outskirts of the city, the 'Heart of Woods Pet Beast Breeding Base' occupied a vast area, and there were people nearby.\nNot far from the base was another enormous estate.\nAbove the main entrance of the estate, a huge signboard likewise stood: 'Yun Tian Pet Beast Combat Resort'.\nHowever, compared to the Heart of Woods Pet Beast Breeding Base, this resort estate boasted a much finer environment.\nNot only was it noticeably adorned with a rather beautiful garden and exquisitely maintained, but the estate also featured a row of small villas and an eight-story building towering among them.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ\nAt the topmost level of the central building, within the enormous living room that spanned two floors, a graceful figure stood before the window.\nThis was a woman appearing to be in her thirties. She was dressed in ordinary home attire, yet it could not conceal the potent allure and attractiveness women of that age possessed.\nAt that moment, however, the woman—whose poise and figure were outstanding—furrowed her brows slightly, her gaze fixed on something distant with displeasure.\nThe piercing wolf howls drew her attention, her gaze penetrating the distance, looking down upon the babbling Lingxi River miles away, as well as the Heart of Woods Pet Beast Breeding Base hidden by the forest.\nAnd there was that figure, riding a wolf, rushing towards the riverbank.\nThe woman finally spoke, \"Is this the young owner of the breeding base? Our little landlord?\"\nNot far behind the woman stood a man, his demeanor cautious and subservient.\nIf Su Ping were here, he would immediately recognize the man. This was the rich fool who had rented the large empty land from his family, the very same person who built what Su Ping and his father considered a somewhat foolish Pet Beast training ground and resort.\nNow, facing the woman who stood commandingly before the window, he dared not even glance at her well-defined silhouette, let alone venture any closer.\nIn response to the woman's question, he wiped the sweat from his forehead before replying, \"Yes, Chairwoman.\"\nThe woman turned her head to give him a look, \"It's been two years, and you haven't made any progress with the task I gave you. How can you still face me?\"\nFacing the reprimand, the man dared not defend himself in the slightest, only bowing his head even lower.\nSeeing her subordinate's dejected state, the woman didn't press the issue, merely pausing before saying, \"Forget it. You said that Su Anyong has temporarily left Linzhou City, and now this Heart of Wood Cultivation Base, along with this large tract of land of ours, is under this youngster's control, right?\"\n\"It should be. Old Su... Su Anyong said he was heading to Beihai City up north for a while and definitely won't be returning soon. Su Ping is making all the family decisions.\"\nThe woman nodded in satisfaction, her striking red lips revealing a faint smile, \"If that's the case, our battle arena has been running low on Elite and Ordinary Level wolf-type training beasts recently, hasn't it?\n\"Moreover, in a few days, graduates from Linzhou City's schools will be looking for actual combat practice after training their Pet Beasts for a while. We'll likely be short on Low-level training beasts by then.\n\"In the next few days, find some time to invite this young man over. Discuss a collaboration for renting those Forest Wolves from their base.\"\n\"Yes, I understand, Chairwoman.\"\n\"Get to it, then.\"\nAfter giving the order with a casual air, the woman paid no further attention to her subordinate's departure.\nShe, too, was aware that her subordinate was likely curious why Tianyun Group, a leading corporation in the entire Jianghai Province, would care about such an inconspicuous piece of land in the suburbs of Linzhou City. Although the land was indeed sizable and, after the urban planning changes in Linzhou City, not too far from the city center, it wasn't so critical as to warrant such attention from her, the chairwoman.\nThe door closed, leaving the woman alone in the vast living room, staring at the distant Lingxi River, lost in thought.\nIn the silent room, only the woman's solitary murmur could be heard,\n\"I wonder if the Qintian Monitor has received news and sent anyone yet. I need to find a way to speed things up.\n\"It's truly exciting. I wonder which predecessor's Secret Realm will appear here in the future...\"",

      "content": "Chapter 6 - 6: Old Sha's Grief and Rage, the Magic Potion is Complete!\nHeart of Woods Pet Beast Breeding Base, inside the manor.\nThe door to the Magic Potion Workshop swung open.\nOld Sha's expression was fierce as he looked at the smoke-filled workshop.\nOld Sha didn't know what his young master was up to.\nBut this process, as abhorrent as stewing shit, made Old Sha doubt for the first time whether it had been the right decision for Su Anyong to leave and entrust the family's Pet Beast Breeding Base to his young master.\nNow was the most struggling and conflicted moment in his wolf life.\nHe feared that his young master would suffer from the fumes.\nIf he were to pass out or even be suffocated by the stench inside, Old Sha wouldn't be able to explain it to Su Anyong.\nHowever, with the Magic Potion Workshop's door standing open, the overpowering stench was no longer just an assault on the nose. It also stung the eyes!\nFor canine-type Pet Beasts, their sense of smell is already the sharpest.\nOne can imagine, for Old Sha, a Commander Level being, standing in front of the door to the Magic Potion Workshop and enduring the pungent smell to check on Su Ping inside required an enormous amount of courage and deep loyalty.Google seaʀᴄh\nSu Ping stood atop a footstand, holding a medicine pestle half a meter tall in his hand.\nThe cauldron below heated the entire interior to a constant high temperature of eighty degrees.\nFully equipped, he wore a gas mask and oxygen tank, peering into the billowing smoke of the medicine cauldron.\nAt this moment, Su Ping extolled Blue Star's technology.\nIf this were ancient times, the concoction of Magic Potions could only be done by oneself, and without this equipment, I would have reason to doubt that I could produce much of the perfect 'Heart of Woods' Magic Potion, even if I knew the formula.\nThe tremendous technological advancements of the new era are just wonderful.\nIt has not only yielded high-value mechanical-type Pet Beasts but also made life much easier for Beast Tamers and Breeders.\nThe various medicinal ingredients had already been thrown in.\nThe Wolf Tobacco had also been completely added.\nNext came the final phase of the process.\nThe next moment, within the thick smoke, Su Ping twisted the temperature control of the cauldron, immediately raising the temperature to one hundred and twenty degrees.\nThe rapid stirring of the pestle made Su Ping's arms ache.\nFortunately, after officially becoming a Beast Tamer and advancing in rank, a Beast Tamer's physical body also receives a certain enhancement.\nIf it had been before, Su Ping definitely couldn't have sustained such high-intensity concoction.\nWith the sudden increase in temperature and rapid stirring, the previously pulp-like dark green slime below started to bubble. GURGLE. GURGLE.\nAn even more indescribable foul stench arose from it. The gas mask filtered out this smell, but the smoke had gradually dissipated. Through his gas mask, Su Ping observed the liquid at the bottom of the cauldron.\nFinally, when Su Ping's arms had gone numb, the thick liquid fully formed. Su Ping then leaped down from the footstand and reached the outlet beneath the cauldron, taking out the Vessels he'd prepared beforehand.\nImmediately, from the outlet valve, a dark green liquid resembling slightly diluted loquat syrup slowly flowed out.\nSu Ping finally breathed a sigh of relief.\nAfter closing the cauldron and activating the self-filtering function, Su Ping, holding the now sealed potion, stepped out of the workshop.\nThrough the gas mask, Su Ping saw Old Sha, who was wearing a look of silent complaint.\nIs it really that exaggerated?\nSu Ping belatedly took off his gas mask.\nThen he instinctively sniffed. Within less than a tenth of a second, Su Ping quickly directed the nearby oxygen mask toward himself.\nHe rubbed the even more resentful Old Sha.\n\"Old Sha, I've wronged you, but don't worry. After eating this stuff tomorrow, you'll know the benefits!\"\nLooking at his young master's face, brimming with determination, Old Sha glanced again at the dark green 'essence' in the small bottle that Su Ping had painstakingly concocted over several hours.\nHis eyes were filled with complexity; he never imagined that one day, his young master, whom he had watched grow up, would attempt to poison him.\nTo feed him shit!?\nAnd to do it right in front of him, no less.\nOld Sha swallowed hard, and his massive wolf body emitted a crisp GULP.\nThen, before Su Ping could react, Old Sha dashed off toward the forest of the base as if he were a puff of smoke, so fast that not even his shadow was visible.\nSu Ping scratched his head and looked again at the modified 'Heart of Woods' Magic Potion in his hand.\nIs it really that exaggerated?\nA bit belatedly, he turned his head back to the still foul-smelling Magic Potion Workshop, and recalling the odor from earlier, he involuntarily shuddered.\nHuh... Refreshing and mind-clearing!\nAlthough this stuff is indeed a bit hard on the eyes, I still need to consume it.\nBut not now.\nThe Magic Potion formula required the concoction to cool and set into a gel after the final simmering to be considered fully complete.\nAfter a busy day, Su Ping wasn't in the mood to ponder further. Once the bottle of Heart of Woods had returned to room temperature, he put it into a refrigeration box and then headed back to his own room.\nXiao Qing was still sleeping in the Beast Taming Space.\nSince becoming his Contracted Beast, Su Ping's own Realm could greatly reflect on the Pet Beast itself, accelerating its growth.\nAnd Xiao Qing was in a phase of rapid growth.\nHe opened his phone, and the first thing that appeared was a message alert from his class group.\nSu Ping had just clicked in when a message appeared:\n\"Heard the class leader contracted a Crimson Fang Tiger with Racial Potential for Commander Level. Impressive! Looks like we'll be under the class leader's protection from now on! @Zhou Shuchen\"\nNo sooner had this message been sent than a few seconds later, another message appeared:\n\"Not bad. I just got lucky. Director Zhang helped me find a connection, and the down payment was 2,000,000. Sigh, time to start paying off the loan. But it's worth it. The Crimson Fang Tiger has already mastered Flaming Pounce after just half a month since the contract—a talent that not any ordinary Pet Beast can match.\"\nDespite a tone of self-deprecation, the underlying message was clearly one of pride.\nIt was none other than the class leader, Zhou Shuchen, who had even changed his profile picture to a crimson-hued young tiger.\nClearly, even though the world had changed, the same behavior endured within the class group.\nOnly now, the topic was about Contracted Beasts.\nBut frankly speaking, a Crimson Fang Tiger with Commander Level Racial Potential was indeed impressive.\nA down payment of 2,000,000 wasn't expensive.\nHowever, Zhou Shuchen's family was just an average household. Given the connection with Director Zhang, the figure for the loan was still unimaginably high.\nThis guy really had some guts.\nSpeaking of which, the class leader's talent was said to be the relatively rare 'Fire Element Affinity.' This talent was capable of providing a certain boost in combat power to fire Attribute Pet Beasts and was quite suitable for becoming a Combat Beast Tamer.\nIt's no wonder he and his family probably emptied their savings to secure him his first Contracted Beast, the Crimson Fang Tiger.\n\"In our class now, is Su Ping the only one left without a Contracted Beast?\"\nSomeone suddenly asked.\n\"Su the Rich Kid has high standards. Previously, Director Zhang kindly recommended him a species with Commander Level Racial Potential, the Scythe Giant Centipede, yet he refused it.\"\nZhou Shuchen's Crimson Fang Tiger avatar flickered again.\nSu Ping arched an eyebrow. During school, this 'fine' class leader had always been courteous with him—not overly friendly, but he had never offended him either.\nAfter all, even though the Su family wasn't part of the so-called 'Beast Taming Elite,' they did have a minor heritage.\nThis class leader was the type who knew how to play his cards right.\nYet here he was, acting so passive-aggressively in the group chat after graduation. Was this his true nature revealing itself?",

      "content": "Chapter 7 - 7: Classmate Group, Xiao Qing's First Promotion!\nSu Ping's brow furrowed slightly as he looked at the chat group of his classmates.\nBut he didn't mind it much.\nFollow current novᴇls on ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nUpon graduation, in the special Beastmaster Society of Blue Star, those high-level Beast Taming Academies weren't places just anyone could aspire to. Either one had a uniquely unparalleled awakening of Beast Taming Talent, incredibly strong, and was specially recruited immediately upon becoming a Beast Tamer and contracting a Pet Beast. Besides that, the main requirement was to pass a professional Beast Tamer assessment. Only by passing and registering as a genuine professional Beast Tamer with the Beast Master Association could one have the opportunity. Therefore, for the vast majority, graduation at this stage was tantamount to stepping into society.\nThat Director Zhang was Zhang Guowei, the Dean of Studies at Linzhou City's Sixth Advanced Middle School, where Su Ping had studied. Teachers in such schools usually had some connections in society. For students with good Talent who had the chance to become combat Beast Tamers, he would act as a broker, selecting a good path for them. He would also receive a handsome compensation for himself.\nTake Zhou Shuchen, for example. With his natural affinity for the Fire Element, Zhou Shuchen possessed an outstanding elemental combat Talent. Consequently, Zhang Guowei found him a connection with the Fire King Company. This secured him a Crimson Fang Tiger Pet Beast with Commander Level Racial Potential—something uncommon for ordinary people. Beyond the huge down payment and future loans, he would also have to work as an employee at the Fire King Company.\nIndeed, after graduation, Director Zhang had also approached Su Ping, but Su Ping had refused.\nSu Ping's Talent seemed rather ordinary.\nWhat good is being able to carry a few more Pet Beasts?\nWild Pet Beasts are very difficult to align with their master's intent! And the environment in the Beast Taming Space can easily incite rebellion among wild Pet Beasts.\nEven if you did carry dozens of wild Pet Beasts, what then? Aren't you afraid of being devoured upon their release?\nAs such, this Talent is often used for logistical purposes. And precisely because it's for logistical use, this Talent becomes particularly applicable, necessary for transportation, storage, and many similar tasks. After all, transporting Pet Beasts is extremely dangerous, especially wild ones.\nNonetheless, although the Su family was by no means wealthy—especially since their Pet Beast Breeding Base's livelihood depended on rental income, a rather tenuous existence in the Beastmaster Society—Su Anyong would certainly not stoop to selling his son in exchange for a Commander Level first Pet Beast. Xiao Qing, a rare bloodline mutant who had gained the Poison Type Attribute, was proof of this. Bloodline Mutations are more valuable than Racial Potential at the Elite or Commander Level. Racial Potential can be enhanced through Evolution and breakthroughs with advanced resources. However, changing a Pet Beast's Attribute, though possible by consuming certain resources or Magic Potions, comes with great danger. A single misstep could lead to the Pet Beast becoming crippled or even dying. Most importantly, Pet Beasts with rare Attribute Mutations generally have an upper limit in Racial Talent that is simply incomparable.\nIt wasn't hard to guess why Zhou Shuchen was currently so sarcastic towards him. Director Zhang had likely told Zhou Shuchen—who was young, idolized Zhang Guowei as a mentor and guiding light, and was also the class president—about Su Ping's rejection and perceived ingratitude. Clearly, this guy was probably sharing a common resentment. He's still just so young.\nSu Ping shook his head, not angry but feeling somewhat sad for Zhou Shuchen. A Commander Level initial Pet Beast with such Racial Potential was indeed precious to them. However, with his Talent, Zhou Shuchen could have easily applied for an official loan at Linzhou's Beast Master Association branch. There was no need to pay a hefty sum of Money and also sign a contract to work for someone. However, the constraints of his vision, mindset, and understanding meant that Zhou, having been metaphorically 'sold' by Director Zhang, was probably still happily counting the money for his 'benefactor.' And usually, such people, once they gain a bit of power, can't help but get carried away.\n\"Wow, a Scythe Giant Centipede? That's a rather advanced Pet Beast with Commander Level Racial Potential! If I had this opportunity, I would never refuse it.\"\n\"But maybe Su Ping's family isn't lacking in Commander Level Pet Beasts with Racial Potential, right? It's normal if he doesn't want to owe Zhang Guowei anything.\"\n\"Owe favors? What could Director Zhang expect from you?\"\n\"That's true...\"\n\"@Su Ping, Bro Ping, have you contracted a Pet Beast yet?\"\nThe messages in the group flashed quickly, and soon, someone directly tagged him.\nSu Ping thought for a moment and decided not to lurk any longer. He replied, \"Contracted one. A Forest Wolf from our family's Pet Beast Breeding Base!\"\nBefore Li Shu, who was on good terms with Su Ping and had asked the initial question, could reply, the Crimson Fang Tiger avatar—which Su Ping had found somewhat annoying from its first appearance—flashed again: \"Forest Wolf? Isn't that species' Racial Potential capped at Elite Level!? Su Ping, so you're taking over the family business too, HAHA! Congratulations, congratulations!\"\nThe three exclamation marks conveyed this person's mockery and dismissal of the previous commenter.\nLook at that, Young Master Su's family has such a substantial foundation, yet he only contracted a Forest Wolf.\nAlthough, for ordinary students like them, a Forest Wolf with Racial Potential reaching Elite Peak was indeed a good choice. But in front of this Crimson Fang Tiger Beast Tamer, it was clearly a notch lower. During their school years, for reasons related to both family and personal Ability, Zhou, the class president, often couldn't compare to Su Ping. Even once, when romantic feelings first blossomed, the girl he pursued had rejected him because of Su Ping.\nBut Su Ping had no interest in wasting words on someone who got carried away with a little success; engaging in online arguments wasn't his style either.\nHowever, suddenly, an avatar and name that had never appeared before sent a message: \"@Su Ping, Su Ping, near your place, is there a Yuntian Pet Beast Battle Resort?\"\n\"Yin Yin, the school beauty!!!\"\n\"@Yin Yin, Yin's school belle, have you contracted a Pet Beast?\"\n\"...\"\nAs soon as this avatar, a cartoon fish, and the name appeared in the group, a flurry of replies instantly followed.\nYin Yin was the so-called school beauty of Sixth Middle School.\nSu Ping had always found it rather amusing and pointless that a group of physically immature young girls would be judged as school beauties. Besides, aesthetic judgment is subjective; 'school beauty' is just a title.\nHowever, this Yin Yin was indeed quite famous.\n\"@Yin Yin, that's right. It's right next door to my house.\"\n\"@Su Ping, I'm going to train in Pet Beast battling at the resort in a few days. When I do, I'd like to visit your place. I've never seen a Pet Beast Breeding Base before. Is that okay?\"\nSu Ping frowned slightly. However, before he could respond, the group had already erupted.\n\"Yin Yin, you're going to train in Pet Beast battling? Can we join you, please?\"\n\"Yeah, our Xiao Hong recently advanced to Normal Second Rank and learned a Racial Skill! She's itching to try it out, HEE HEE!\"\n\"Great idea, let's all go together!\"\n\"Perfect! It's been over a month since graduation, and we haven't had a proper get-together yet...\"\n\"...\"\nAt this age, the allure of hormones was clearly boundless. And evidently, Su Ping's opinion didn't seem very important at that moment. After all, they were planning to visit the Yuntian Resort next door; his family's Pet Beast Breeding Base was just an incidental stop.\nShaking his head, Su Ping didn't bother to read or reply further. He even left the class group, tossed his phone aside, and checked on Xiao Qing, who was fast asleep. He could feel Xiao Qing's aura consolidating. Under his nourishment as a Beast Tamer, it seemed Xiao Qing would soon advance from Normal First Rank to Normal Second Rank.\nSu Ping smiled with satisfaction and slowly closed his eyes. The earlier excitement subsided, and he drifted into a deep sleep.\n「The next morning,」 Su Ping's eyes snapped open. He quickly dealt with breakfast and washing up, then glanced at the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas.\nSure enough, under the Forest Wolf Catalog, an additional log entry had appeared: \"[After spending a day in close contact with two Forest Wolves, your Forest Wolf Catalog experience has increased by +7 points.]\"\nBut that wasn't the most important thing. The most important thing was that overnight, the cooled Heart of Woods Magic Potion had been completed.",

      "content": "Chapter 8 - 8: Old Sha, Resigned to Death! Taking the Magic Potion!\nThe morning sun rose in the east, adding a few degrees of intense heat to the already high temperatures. A gentle breeze rustled through the forest, bringing a rare coolness to the summer morning.\nSitting in the wicker rocking chair where Su Anyong often lay, Xiao Qing, having grown larger, was still held in Su Ping's arms, excitedly watching everything in front of her.\nIn front of Su Ping was an extremely spectacular sight. Outside the forest, within the shadows cast by the canopy, before the manor's path, Forest Wolves of various sizes appeared before him. They behaved like well-trained domestic dogs, sitting on the ground, their green eyes intently fixed on Su Ping. At a rough count, there were over twenty of them.\nAmong them, seven adult Forest Wolves had reached Elite Level or above. One had reached Elite Ninth Order, making it the highest-level Forest Wolf in the base besides Old Sha. Fewer than twenty were still at Ordinary Level, most of them growing pups.\nHowever, in today's Heart of Woods Pet Beast Breeding Base, the most valuable assets were actually these pups. Normally, those who came to purchase Pet Beasts would buy young ones to nurture as their first. Newly awakened Beast Tamers at the Ordinary Level could not contract with an Elite Level Forest Wolf. Furthermore, Beast Tamers who had advanced to Elite Level wouldn't usually buy an adult Forest Wolf, as its potential was limited and its development predictable. Therefore, these seven Elite Level Forest Wolves were largely kept as breeding stock.\nIn front of this wolf pack stood Old Sha, eyeing Su Ping with a wary and cautious look.\nClearly, from his apprehensive gaze, he was still thinking about Su Ping's threat yesterday to poison him and feed him feces.\nSure enough, after Old Sha had gathered all the Forest Wolves, Su Ping took out a bottle of dark green liquid. Su Ping slowly turned and looked at Old Sha.\n\"Old Sha!\"\nOld Sha shuddered, then, with a look full of deep resentment, turned his gaze to Su Ping. However, in the end, Old Sha didn't run away as he did yesterday.\nThere were rules within the Wolf Tribe. Old Sha possessed the authority of a Wolf King. He commanded the members of the Wolf Tribe, and his attitude reflected the pack's attitude towards Su Ping. Su Anyong had entrusted the Heart of Woods base to Su Ping, so Old Sha had to take the lead and let Su Ping become the 'king' these little ones would now obey. Therefore, at this time, even if his young master intended to harm him, Old Sha would not back down.\nBut when Su Ping actually took the vessel filled with dark green liquid from his pouch, Old Sha's body still trembled slightly. Then, under the curious gaze of all the Forest Wolves, he walked forward with somewhat trembling limbs.\nSeeing Old Sha's pleading gaze, Su Ping was somewhat speechless.\nIs all this fuss necessary? If Xiao Qing weren't so young, and if I didn't need to test the potion's effects on the other Forest Wolves first, would this be so troublesome?\nSu Ping stroked the stiff fur on the temples of Old Sha, who had lowered his head, and then softly said, \"Old Sha, you have to trust me! I'm doing this for your own good.\"\nOld Sha glanced at Su Ping, then at the concoction. Although it had cooled, it still retained some of yesterday's smell after being unsealed. Old Sha looked back at Su Ping again.\nThose green eyes clearly said:\nI don't believe you one bit!\nBut in the end, he nodded.\nAfter all, Old Sha was nearly two cycles older than this young master. Possessing wisdom not inferior to humans, he naturally knew what his young master was actually doing. He's making a Magic Potion. Su Anyong, when he was young, also tried a few times. I even ingested it, but the final effects... And the young master, having just graduated and suddenly taking over Heart of Woods, naturally has the ambition to try out his own ideas. So, after a night of deep thought, I know that even if I'm poisoned to death, I must protect the young master's pride. I can't let him be like that unreliable Su Anyong, just abandoning efforts and completely wasting the old man's life's work!\n\"AWOO...\"\nThus, Old Sha closed his eyes and let out an extremely desolate howl. It lacked only tears welling up in the corners of his eyes.\nWith an air of heroic self-sacrifice, as if a loyal pet resigned to death at its master's command, this display made Su Ping utterly exasperated as he poured out the Magic Potion.\nHe decided not to waste any more words. He looked at Old Sha, who had his eyes closed and mouth wide open, as if bracing himself to be fed feces by his young master, and directly poured this dark green, jelly-like Magic Potion, which resembled herbal jelly, into Old Sha's mouth.\nThen, Old Sha's long, steaming tongue lapped it up, swallowing it down his throat without even properly savoring the taste, gobbling it down as if it were a priceless treasure eaten in haste.\nOld Sha opened his eyes and looked at the now-empty Magic Potion bottle, then at the young master eagerly watching him. His gaze suddenly lost its brightness, as if the world had turned gray in an instant. Afterward, he came to Su Ping's side and began to whimper softly.\nAlthough it was wolf language, Su Ping could still roughly understand some of the meaning:\nYou must carry on the legacy of the Heart of Woods Pet Beast Breeding Base, and definitely grow and strengthen the breeding of the Forest Wolf! Do not let down the hard work and trust of your grandfather, and develop even more powerful evolutionary paths for the Forest Wolf! And, you must strive to become an even more incredible Beast Tamer, you stinky kid!!!!!\nThese sentiments, and more, were conveyed, as if he was delivering his last will and testament. It was also as if an elder on his deathbed faced his kin with his final, earnest teachings.\nFor a moment, under the sunlight that enveloped the area outside the woods, the atmosphere became incredibly solemn and poignant. Even the rest of the wolf pack lurking nearby, clueless about what was happening, let out mournful howls in response, as if they were bidding farewell to their Wolf King, their elder.\nIf Su Ping himself didn't know what was really going on, he might have been moved by the atmosphere.\nBut what the hell is going on here? I'm feeding him a Magic Potion, not poison!\nFortunately, Su Ping didn't have to wait long. Suddenly, the utterly serene expression on Old Sha's face, which seemed prepared for death, changed. The low whimpering stopped abruptly.\nSu Ping's expression turned very serious as he observed Old Sha's reaction. In that instant, sparkling emerald specks of light appeared on Old Sha's originally bluish-gray fur, as if he were enveloped by a faint, verdant green glow.\nThroughout the area outside the forest, the air seemed to become incredibly clear. Simultaneously, in the nearby woods and beneath Old Sha's feet, branches burst through the soil, growing at a visible pace. At the same time, a faint aura emanated, making Su Ping's eyes widen in shock.\nThe Forest Wolf pack behind him reacted even more intensely, trembling with fear and prostrating on the ground, not daring to gaze directly at their Wolf King's aura.\nThis process lasted only a minute.\nThe next moment, all the peculiar phenomena disappeared, replaced by a crisp and exceedingly jubilant Wolf Howl filled with indescribable joy!",

      "content": "Chapter 9 - 9: Old Sha's Breakthrough! Poison Vine Strangulation!\nBefore Su Ping could react, he was once again enjoying the sensation of being tackled onto the soft grass.\nThen came the lapping of a moist tongue.\nIn his current state, Old Sha bore no resemblance to his earlier readiness to face death.\nHeh. Pet Beasts.\nDisgustedly wiping the sticky saliva from his cheek where Old Sha had licked him, Su Ping finally used his Eye of Truth once more to look at the uncontrollably excited Old Sha:\n[Forest Wolf (Wild)]\n[Current Level: Commander Second Rank]\n[Racial Potential: Elite Tenth Rank]\n[Skills: Sunlight Absorption (Perfection), Vine Strangling (Proficient), Self-Healing (Proficiency), Rapid Growth (Proficient), Wolf King (Beginner), Heart of Woods (Beginner)]\n[Heart of Woods (Beginner): Enhances the power, effectiveness, and casting speed of Wood Element abilities to a certain degree and allows for the absorption of Wood Element power for rapid self-recovery.]\nJust as expected!\nA thrill shot through Su Ping's eyes.\nNot only did it get Heart of Woods, but its level also increased by another rank! Did the addition of Wolf Tobacco cause such a miraculous chemical reaction with the Heart of Woods Magic Potion?\nSu Ping did not understand. The superficial knowledge of cultivation science he had learned at school clearly couldn't explain this.\nBut he knew one thing: the significance of what had just happened.\nTo put it bluntly, an ordinary Forest Wolf cub would, at most, fetch a price between 800,000 to 1,200,000 Gold.\nHowever, a Forest Wolf that had awakened Heart of Woods could command a price at least three to five times higher!\nIf it had good aptitude, practiced its Skills diligently, and improved its Skill proficiency and level growth quickly, it could be worth even more.\nIt might even be comparable to some lower-tier Commander Level talent Pet Beast cubs.\nThe Heart of Woods Skill was incredibly powerful.\nSuch Skills that enhanced corresponding elemental power, though not so-called Super-Rank Skills, were often more practical than some Super-Rank Skills as passive abilities!\nEven at the Beginner level, with the boost from Heart of Woods, Old Sha's strength had increased by thirty to fifty percent compared to before.\nIf they were to fight in places like jungles, mountain forests, or grasslands, it would be even more terrifying!\nHowever, it was precisely because of how formidable it was that Skills like Heart of Woods were exceedingly rare and difficult to obtain.\nBut now, with the help of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, this original Heart of Woods Magic Potion had undergone such a metamorphosis simply by adding one ingredient.\nSu Ping's eyes blazed with excitement. However, at that very moment, a new prompt appeared in the log records at the bottom of the solely illuminated Forest Wolf Catalog entry on the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas:\n[Successfully enabled the associated Pet Beast to acquire the Skill: Heart of Woods, and its rank was improved. Catalog Experience +30 points!]\nSu Ping was startled and took another look at the now-lit Forest Wolf Catalog:\n[Catalog: Forest Wolf]\n[A special Wolf Tribe adept in using Wood Attribute, with extremely strong life force. Typical adult Forest Wolves are Elite Level, and their proficient Skills include: Sunlight Absorption, Vine Strangling, Self-Healing, Rapid Growth, etc.]\n[Current Catalog Level: 1 (152/500)]\nThe experience had reached 152 points.\nIf it weren't for the 285 points spent previously on perfecting the Heart of Woods Magic Potion formula, I'd only be a bit more than a hundred points shy of upgrading the Catalog to Level 2! Looking at it this way, it seems increasing the Catalog Level isn't so difficult!\nHowever...\nSu Ping's gaze quickly moved past Old Sha, looking at the group of Forest Wolves that had become very docile.\nClearly, to quickly increase the Catalog Level, the more Forest Wolves, the better; and the more Forest Wolves with adequate intimacy with him, the better!\nOld Sha had been like family to him for so many years. There was no need to say more.\nXiao Qing had formed a Soul Contract with him, binding them directly together, so naturally, the same applied.\nBut as for these more than twenty Forest Wolves, although he had brought Old Sha to feed them before and they were familiar, their intimacy was clearly still insufficient according to the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas's judgment!\nObviously, if he wanted to raise the Catalog Level quickly, the number of Forest Wolves with adequate intimacy was of paramount importance.\nAnd how could he make their intimacy reach the standard?\nDaily interactions, feeding, training.\nAll of these could work, but they obviously wouldn't meet the standard quickly.\nGlancing at Old Sha, who was extremely excited and wagging its tail in a way Su Ping had never seen before, Su Ping instantly understood.\nIf I can help these little guys increase their strength and enhance their abilities—especially if they can do it effortlessly, as if lying down—then it will undoubtedly increase their intimacy with me by a lot!\nInstantly, Su Ping solidified his decision.\nI'll continue concocting Magic Potions! But before that, I need to see Old Sha's changes!\n\"Old Sha, use Vine Strangling on that tree!\"\nOld Sha's green eyes suddenly lit up with spirit. It had never dreamed that Su Ping could achieve something that even Su Ping's own grandfather hadn't managed, something Su Anyong had completely given up on!\nIt knew that its young master, whom it had watched grow up, would never harm it!\nImmediately, Old Sha's gaze fixed on one of the huge trees in the forest.\nThe next moment, numerous dark green branches and vines either burst from the soil or condensed out of thin air.\nThey instantly entwined the giant tree that was being used as a practice target.\nThe vines were as thick as a bowl and extremely tough, even gleaming with a metallic luster.\nMoreover, as they continued to entwine and constrict, Su Ping soon discovered extremely sharp barbs appearing on the vines, elevating their lethality by another significant measure!ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nAfter only a short entanglement, deep gashes that looked as if they were made by a saw appeared on the trunk of the towering tree in his small forest.\nThe speed of the attack and the power of the vines were incomparable to before!\nHe thought that even a Commander Level opponent of the same rank, if caught in this web of vines, would have its blood drained in an instant. It would suffer wounds all over, as if subjected to death by a thousand cuts.\nEven Su Ping couldn't help but draw a sharp breath.\nHowever, Xiao Qing, who had been quiet in his arms, suddenly became animated as well.\nIt stared intently at the entwining vines, as if it had suddenly understood something.\nXiao Qing formed a Soul Contract with me and advanced to Ordinary Second Rank in just a day. That speed isn't slow. But right now, it only has the basic Forest Wolf Skill, Sunlight Absorption.\nIt could sunbathe to reduce its need for food and conserve energy, allowing it to grow rapidly.\nYet, it has no combat abilities so far. I wasn't in a rush before, but now the situation seems a bit different, doesn't it?\nIndeed, Xiao Qing lightly leaped from his embrace, landed in front of him, and then, opening its mouth slightly, let out an extremely tender cry:\n\"AWOOOOO...\"\nThe next moment, several delicate vines, only as thick as woolen yarn, burst forth from the soil!\nThe difference was, aside from their thinness, these vines had a slightly different color—they were tinged with purple.\nSu Ping blinked, looking incredulously at his Pet Beast.\nIt learned it just like that?\nIt's true that Forest Wolves typically learn their Racial Skills as they grow.\nVine Strangling was one of the Forest Wolf's primary combat techniques, so this was natural.\nHowever, a Pet Beast's talent is judged by the speed at which it learns and masters Skills.\nFor example, just yesterday in the student group chat, the class monitor, Zhou Shuchen, had proudly stated that his newly contracted Crimson Fang Tiger mastered one of its primary combat Skills, Flaming Pounce, in just half a month.\nThis was indeed quite impressive.\nBut how could my Xiao Qing learn Vine Strangling just by watching Old Sha use it once?\nUsing the Eye of Truth, Su Ping looked at his Pet Beast with a touch of disbelief:\n[Mutated Forest Wolf (Contracted)]\n[Attribute: Wood, Poison]\n[Current Level: Ordinary Second Rank]\n[Racial Potential: Elite Tenth Rank]\n[Skills: Sunlight Absorption (Beginner), Poison Vine Strangulation (Beginner)]\nWait a minute?\nSu Ping was taken aback. This wasn't the regular Vine Strangling that common Forest Wolves mastered.\nIt's this so-called Poison Vine Strangulation?\nSu Ping looked at Xiao Qing with a strange expression.\nCould it be that Dad, who supposedly chose this Forest Wolf after meticulous selection—though it was probably just a stroke of luck—actually found a mutated Forest Wolf? Not only does it have the potential to master Poison Type abilities, but it's also exceptionally talented?",

      "content": "Chapter 10 - 10: First Battle, Rapid Promotion Plan!\nSu Ping became interested. Xiao Qing was very young, but the Talent it had already displayed was enough to surprise even Su Ping! Originally, he thought he would have to wait for Xiao Qing to grow a little older and, after its Level increased, purchase some Poison Type resources for it to consume. Xiao Qing would then be able to master this mutated Poison Type Ability, but now it seemed he had greatly underestimated Xiao Qing's Talent!\n\"Well done!\"\nHe rubbed Xiao Qing's proudly raised head, and his gaze shifted to the other Forest Wolves. It quickly fixated on the youngest of them all. This Forest Wolf was also the weakest among these ordinary ones, and its Level was only one rank higher than Xiao Qing's—merely a common Third Rank.\nBefore, Su Ping had not really considered Xiao Qing's combat ability at this time. But now, since Xiao Qing had comprehended a Skill, he wanted to see how effective and powerful Poison Vine Strangulation was.\nHe glanced at Old Sha and said, \"Old Sha, let that little guy battle Xiao Qing!\"\nOnly by growing in battle would one become more adept at using Skills. And Su Ping wanted to see just how potent the Poison Vine Strangulation that Xiao Qing had just learned truly was.\n\"AWOO!\"\nThe tiny Forest Wolf singled out by Old Sha stepped forward cautiously, eyeing both Su Ping and the proud little wolf beside Su Ping's trouser leg. Obviously, this Little Forest Wolf, too, had been born recently, and its Talents were relatively average. Even now, though it was one rank higher than Xiao Qing, it hadn't comprehended the Skill Vine Strangling.\nIn the face of its opponent, Xiao Qing did not show the affection it had for Su Ping but displayed a hint of disdain, and a somewhat childish howl sounded.\nThe eyes of the Little Forest Wolf flashed fiercely, and it pounced straight at Xiao Qing. However, before it could get close, vines that appeared out of nowhere had already tightly wrapped it up. The delicate purple-green vines looked non-threatening, but having entered a tier, their strength far exceeded that of an ordinary human.\n\"WHINE...\"\nThe Little Forest Wolf howled, struggling to break free, but Su Ping keenly noted that the Little Forest Wolf's power at this moment had significantly weakened compared to usual! And the wounds seemed swollen.\nThis poison is strong!\nThrough the soul connection, Su Ping signaled Xiao Qing to stop. The battered Little Forest Wolf was finally rescued from the Poison Vine Strangulation, but it seemed as though all its strength had been drained. It couldn't even stand.\nXiao Qing's Poison Vine Strangulation was mainly based on a toxin that paralyzed through the blood. If it were to face a life-and-death enemy in reality, the enemy might not even feel pain from the poison vines but would lose all Ability to resist and die.\nHappy for Xiao Qing, Su Ping quickly scooped up the powerless Little Forest Wolf. He followed Old Sha to the medical room, administered an antidote, and only relaxed a little when he saw it starting to recover. The Little Forest Wolf's eyes opened. It gazed at Xiao Qing, who was perched triumphantly on Su Ping's shoulder, a hint of loss in its own eyes.\nSu Ping stopped in his tracks, thought for a moment, and slowly squatted down, rubbing the similarly thirty-centimeter-tall Little Forest Wolf's head, smiling and said, \"It's okay, you'll grow stronger too. As long as you're in Heart of Woods, I won't give up on any little guy! Keep it up!\"\n\"AWOO!\"\nBefore the Little Forest Wolf could speak, Xiao Qing, who was on Su Ping's shoulder, let out a jealous cry. It leaped lightly beside Su Ping and nipped at his trouser leg with its nascent sharp teeth.\nThen, Xiao Qing looked at its defeated rival with a somewhat unfriendly gaze.\nThis guy actually thought of such a method to vie for our master's affection! How despicable!\nJust as it bared its teeth, Su Ping gently tapped it on the head. When dealing with wolves and any other Pet Beast, besides fostering closeness, one must also make them aware of who the true master is. Xiao Qing felt a little aggrieved.\n\"Heart of Woods is one big family. From now on, you must not bully your companions; you should help and support each other! Understand?\"\nXiao Qing hugged its head with its two immature paws but still let out an \"AWOO,\" clearly responding.\nSurprisingly, the frail Little Forest Wolf looked at Su Ping with some astonishment, then glanced at the slightly different Little Forest Wolf beside him, and a determined look appeared in its eyes. Afterward, it forced itself to stand up on its still-shaky legs and let out an equally immature howl.\n\"AWOO!\" it howled, as if to prove that it wasn't as bad as it seemed.\n\"Good! Very spirited!\"\nSu Ping smiled with satisfaction, set it down on the ground, and then brought over some ointment to help soothe the wounds that were rapidly healing.\nOld Sha, who was standing outside the medical room, watched Su Ping's silhouette in the morning sunlight as he crouched on the ground. Beside that silhouette were two equally small ones. One weak but resolute, the other proud but discontent, yet they showed no resistance toward Su Ping.\nSeeing this, a smile also flitted across Old Sha's eyes. It didn't understand how the medicine that the young master made could awaken the Skills and power of the Heart of Woods after it was consumed. It also didn't understand how the young master had the courage to make such claims. But at this moment, Su Ping's figure standing in the dawn's light truly made Old Sha believe that this young master, who had just become a Beast Tamer, might indeed make this little Pet Beast Breeding Base fundamentally different. Perhaps in the future, he might even become a greater Beast Tamer than his grandfather.\nAt that moment, Su Ping was also suddenly taken aback.\nA new prompt appeared on the record log of the Forest Wolf Catalog in his mind:\n[Encountered and interacted with a common Forest Wolf, intimacy met the requirement, Catalog Level experience +10!]\n[This Forest Wolf has a common bloodline; subsequent daily interactions will yield Catalog Experience +1!]\nThe experience wasn't much; whether it was the experience gained for meeting the intimacy requirement or the Catalog Experience from daily interactions, both were modest. But this was enough to surprise and delight Su Ping.\nIndeed, dealing with Pet Beasts was actually much simpler than interacting with people. Pet Beasts had sharper senses than humans; they could feel who had good intentions. Therefore, when dealing with Pet Beasts, only two words were needed: 'sincerity'!\nRealizing this, Su Ping stood up and waved his hand, declaring, \"Little guys, don't worry, starting now, our Heart of Woods initiates the Rapid Advancement Plan! Let every Forest Wolf awaken the Heart of Woods Skills! Starting with you and Xiao Qing!\"\n\"AWOO...\"\n\"AWOO...\"\nThe two immature wolf howls sounded almost in celebration of their master's bold ambitions.\nOnly Old Sha, who had been smiling at the doorway, felt its expression slump.\nDoes this mean the young master is going to start making that... thing again?\nit thought. Although Old Sha had now experienced the benefits of that concoction, its odor was just too memorable for a wolf.\nWhat a daunting determination indeed.",

      "content": "Chapter 11 - 11: Renting Pet Beasts? The Path to Making Money!\nDING-DONG.\nDING-DONG.\nDING-DONG.\nThe doorbell at Heart of Woods's gate rang. Half a day passed, but not only did no one open the door, there wasn't even a footstep to be heard from within the compound.\nA middle-aged man stood under the scorching sun before the motionless gate, occasionally catching a foul whiff from the yard, which made him grimace.\nWhat on earth was this young master doing at home?\nThe visitor was none other than Manager Guan from the neighboring Yun Tian Pet Beast Training Center. The day before, his chairman had sent him to invite this young master over to discuss renting their Forest Wolves. Yet, Manager Guan had been standing at the gate all morning, assailed by nothing but strange odors drifting from the base, without a glimpse of anyone.\nBefore the chairwoman's arrival, his life had been comfortable; he could even drop by to chat and shoot the breeze with Su Anyong when he was free. But ever since this \"queen\" had arrived, Manager Guan dared not show a hint of negligence. Even though he'd been standing there all morning, as long as he was sure Su Ping was home, he couldn't return empty-handed. He knew the chairman's temper all too well.\nThus, Manager Guan stood there, ringing the doorbell for three solid hours. He'd had no lunch, not even a sip of water. Finally, as Manager Guan stared with mounting anticipation, hurried footsteps at last approached from the other side of the gate.\nTHUD.\nThe gate, a seeming barrier between two worlds, finally swung open for Manager Guan.\nHowever, before Manager Guan, eyes welling with tears, could look at this young master whom he had seen a few times, a wave of stench so overpowering washed over him that he instinctively recoiled several steps. Braving the eye-watering odor, Manager Guan looked at a somewhat sheepish Su Ping.\nWhy wear a gas mask on such a hot day? What on earth have you been concocting in there, kid? Could it be some kind of biochemical weapon? Well, the smell is certainly potent enough.\n\"Uncle Guan? What brings you here?\"\n\"What have you been up to, lad?\" Manager Guan couldn't help but complain. \"You took so long to open the door; I was about to call your dad.\"\nSu Ping scratched his head.\nWhat else could he be doing?\nOf course, he was continuing his work on the Magic Potion. After seeing Xiao Qing's growth and improvement, as well as Little Ones' efforts, Su Ping, as their master, naturally couldn't slack off, could he?\nThe weakest Little Forest Wolf was named Little Ones.\nNow, after toiling away for a good part of the day, he had just placed three new vials of Heart of Woods Magic Potion into the cooling box. He hadn't even removed his protective gear when he finally noticed the doorbell.\n\"Is there something you need?\"\nGiven the overwhelming stench, Manager Guan had no desire to step inside for a proper chat with Su Ping and got straight to the point, \"Lately, the training field is running short on training beasts. How are your Forest Wolves? The price is negotiable!\"\nAs soon as business was mentioned, Manager Guan's expression turned serious.\n\"Uncle Guan, are you looking to rent or to buy?\"\nSu Ping trusted Manager Guan's words. The Dragon Country Beastmaster Association and official authorities had clear regulations: Beast Tamers were not permitted to engage in Pet Beast battles in public areas except under special circumstances. Damaging public facilities or the natural environment could lead to detention for 7-15 days, depending on the severity. If the circumstances were serious, the penalties could be increased accordingly. Battling at one's own home was an option, but Pet Beast battle Skills were incredibly varied and often destructive, so most ordinary people lacked the proper facilities. Consequently, Pet Beast training and battlegrounds were a fairly lucrative business, naturally requiring a supply of Pet Beasts for paid sparring sessions.\nManager Guan thought for a moment and said, \"We're primarily looking to rent. Of course, if you have some of good quality, we could consider buying a few. Also, I don't know if your father mentioned it, but we at Yun Tian are interested in this piece of land...\"\nBut Su Ping interjected directly, \"Uncle Guan, I'm aware of that. However, such a significant matter can't be settled quickly. Let's discuss it another time. As for the Pet Beasts, renting is fine, but selling them probably isn't an option.\"\n\"Ah...\" Manager Guan looked troubled. \"Little Su, we are truly sincere. In this suburban area, besides Yun Tian, there are absolutely no other buyers who would offer such a large sum for this vacant land.\"\nSu Ping merely smiled.\nLooking at the young man before him, Manager Guan felt a sense of helplessness.\nWhy did this kid seem even harder to deal with than his wily old father?\n\"Alright, when you have some free time, let's sit down and discuss this properly. Yun Tian is genuinely sincere. For now, let's talk about renting the Forest Wolves. Your father has worked with us before. For an Ordinary Level Forest Wolf, the rental fee is 300 yuan per day. For them to participate in a Pet Beast battle, it's 500 yuan per battle, win or lose. As for Elite Level Forest Wolves, the minimum rental is 1,000 yuan a day, and the Pet Beast battle price is the same. Of course, every Forest Wolf will be insured...\"\nHowever, before Manager Guan could finish, Su Ping cut in again, \"Uncle Guan, I'm truly busy today. How about this: in a couple of days, if you haven't sought me out, I'll come find you for such a good deal. I'll visit in person, how does that sound?\"\nLooking at Su Ping's smiling face, then at his fully equipped state, and smelling the persistent stench emanating from Heart of Woods, Manager Guan, who had waited for over three hours, could only nod.\nHaving wasted the entire morning and achieved nothing, Manager Guan could already imagine his chairman's fury upon his return.\nHowever, Su Ping really didn't have the leisure to worry about others. After closing the gate, he returned to the living room, took a shower, and then, while stroking Xiao Qing, sank into thought.\nEarning money!\nThat was indeed the most pressing issue.\nThe reason was simple: Heart of Woods did have some resources. There were a few leftover materials for making Magic Potions, but only enough for four doses. He had used them all up today. To continue producing the Heart of Woods Magic Potion, he needed to find a way to earn money.\nLao Guan had certainly been fair. The offered price was quite good. There was high demand for Ordinary and Elite Level sparring Pet Beasts, so the rates were decent. Su Ping was quite satisfied; after all, he needed to engage his Forest Wolves in Pet Beast battles to properly train them and solidify their foundations. Others paying to use his Pet Beasts meant he could get sparring partners for free and even earn money—no one would refuse such a good deal.\nBut it still wasn't enough!\nThe materials for a single dose of Heart of Woods Magic Potion, even at cost, would add up to at least two hundred thousand. If he relied solely on renting out Pet Beasts, it would take a very long time to gather enough for Magic Potions for the twenty-plus Forest Wolves he now had.\nHowever, thinking of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas in his mind, Su Ping clearly couldn't, and wouldn't, wait that long.\nThe issue was, how could he get his hands on such a large sum of money?\nIndeed, the saying 'poverty for scholars, wealth for warriors' holds true. And in this world, when it comes to Controlling Beasts, every aspect involves spending money!\nTo cultivate outstanding Pet Beasts, countless resources were needed, flowing away like water.\nHow to get the money? Su Ping fell into deep thought.",

On one hand, having invested his feelings, he found it hard to part with them. On the other hand, he naturally wanted to rapidly improve the Level of the Forest Wolf Catalog.\nComparing the money from selling with the rewards from the Forest Wolf Catalog's World Origin, Su Ping knew which was more important.\nAfter all, making money isn't limited to a single method.\nTherefore, there was only one thing to do.

Only this could bring him significant money in a short time.\nOf course, Su Ping wouldn't be foolish enough to directly sell the Magic Potion. Given the public order standards of the Dragon Nation, and the countless absolute decrees by the Beast Master Association and the Breeder Association against such actions, robbery and plunder were unlikely to happen directly. However, the high replicability of Magic Potions indeed made them prone to drawing unwanted attention.\nAfter all, this was a precious Magic Potion guaranteed to awaken the Heart of Woods. If he took it to the Breeder Competition, he could probably place in the top five, making Heart of Woods famous worldwide!\nIt was, however, too early for that; Su Ping preferred to make a fortune quietly.\nSo, instead of selling the Magic Potion, he could provide foster training. Though it seemed similar, with the end result still granting the precious Skill of Heart of Woods to the Pet Beast, easing into it by increasing the threshold could reduce a lot of unnecessary attention.\nA batch of Heart of Woods Magic Potion cost just 200,000 in materials. But if he let wealthy Beast Tamers who had contracted Forest Wolves choose, two million, or even three to four million, wouldn't make them blink. They would even pay up more readily than anyone else!\nThis truly was an extremely profitable business. It was no wonder those recognized by the Breeder Association as Senior Breeders, or even Breeding Masters, were unimaginably wealthy. Large conglomerates and corporations were eager to support them.\nIf they managed to develop new Magic Potions or breeding methods, the profits—multiplying tenfold, or even dozens of times more—were indeed tempting.\nThinking of this, a determined glint flashed in Su Ping's eyes. Money was always paramount for beast taming. With money, he could quickly train all twenty-plus of his Forest Wolves, achieving a standard closeness Level with them, and then elevate the Level of the Forest Wolf Catalog even faster.\nWith money, he could buy Pet Beasts of other basic forms to light up the remaining Catalogs and thus gain rewards. He could even purchase incomplete Magic Potions for corresponding Pet Beasts and perfect them using Catalogue Experience, further training Pet Beasts. He could even achieve the Evolution of Xiao Qing and the rest of the Forest Wolves!\nTo accomplish all of this, money was undoubtedly needed!\nAfter all, in the current situation, this was the only avenue to make money quickly. As for truly selling that large plot of land next door that his family rented out? Su Ping clearly hadn't considered it.\nIt was a legacy left by his grandfather. His unreliable father had never entertained the idea, so naturally, he wouldn't either.\nWith that in mind, Su Ping took out his phone and dialed a number while eating dinner.\n「In the center of Linzhou City.」\nInside an office building, a middle-aged man sat behind a solitary desk. He was the editor-in-chief of the Linzhou City Beast Express. He had the typical build of men his age, and his plump cheeks hinted that he must have been quite a looker in his youth. It was just that time had left its marks, along with a shining bald spot. As the editor-in-chief of the largest beast taming network and print media in Linzhou, Li Senlin had a lot on his plate.\nHowever, the ringing of his personal phone still caught his attention. Unsurprisingly, it was his son, Li Shu, who didn't bring him much peace of mind.\n\"Hello, Dad?\"\n\"What is it? Did your Luozisong (Pine) break another plant pot again?\" Li Senlin asked irritably.\n\"Dad! Piney is very well-behaved now, and it's clearly because your flowerpot is too small.\"\n\"Alright, cut the crap. If you have something important to say, say it quickly.\" Li Senlin's tone was somewhat fiery, which was unavoidable. There was still one advertising slot left for the week, and with the development of machinery and online self-media in recent years, it was normal for some local media to grow more slowly.\n\"Dad, I'm talking serious business! I'm here to introduce a client to you today!\"\nLi Senlin was stunned. He glanced suspiciously at his phone; it was indeed his son's number, and the voice was indeed his son's.\nWhat on earth was his son talking about?\nThis unlucky kid! It's good enough he's not causing trouble, and now he's bringing me business?\n\"Hehe, I have a classmate who wants to place an ad with you. He's already sent me the deposit.\"\nActually introducing business?\nOld Li raised an eyebrow. \"Your classmate? What kind of ad? Listen here, the Linzhou Pet Beast Express caters to the whole of Linzhou City and mainly publicizes positive, uplifting Pet Beast news and advertisements. Those ads seeking high-quality Pet Beasts for breeding can't just be published willy-nilly!\"\n\"It's not those. My buddy, Su Ping, wants to advertise his family's Pet Beast Breeding Base.\"\n\"Su Ping?\" Before Old Li's eyes, an image of a handsome, composed young man, unlike his peers, slowly formed.\n\"Yes! His family has a Forest Wolf breeding base by Lingxi River.\"\nForest Wolf? A gleam couldn't help but appear in Old Li's eyes. Although he was an Elite Level Beast Tamer, he had only barely made the breakthrough. Due to his age, he hadn't passed the Beast Tamer exam back then. He wasn't really a Combat Beast Tamer, but his first Pet Beast was a Forest Wolf. Even now, it was one of his closest family members.\n\"Fine. It's rare for you to have a reliable friend. What's the ad?\"\n\"I sent it to you, take a look yourself. I'll hang up now; I need to chat with Su Ping about a gathering at their place in a few days.\"\nThe call ended. Li Senlin finally saw the text message his son had sent earlier, and he saw his son's classmate's so-called advertisement.\nVery soon, however, Li Senlin's expression became extremely strange.\n[Heart of Woods Forest Wolf Breeding Base undertakes training and breeding services for Forest Wolves, with a chance to quickly cultivate the cherished Skill 'Heart of Woods' in Forest Wolves! Those interested can call: 138********, or visit to inquire. Heart of Woods Forest Wolf Breeding Base address: South side of Lingxi River Station, outskirts of Linzhou City.]\nLooking at this advertisement, Li Senlin was silent for a good while. Not passing the Beast Tamer exam was his lifelong regret.\nBut, having a Forest Wolf as his first Pet Beast, he had a very special affection for them and naturally knew just how powerful and rare the Skill 'Heart of Woods' was for Forest Wolves. Yet, how many breeding bases specialized in this in the entire Jianghai Province? There were quite a few nationally renowned large-scale breeding bases! Even those breeding bases wouldn't dare to make such a claim!\nIndeed, he had thought too highly.\nAppearances are deceiving. With his son's character, could he really know any reliable people?\nThis kind of ad certainly attracted attention, but would anyone actually believe it?\nHowever, after looking at the advertisement fee that was transferred along with the ad, Li Senlin shook his head.\nOh well, it's just an ad, and the kid didn't claim he could definitely help a Forest Wolf comprehend the Skill. Even if it did cause some trouble, it wouldn't have anything to do with them.\nWith that thought, Li Senlin didn't dwell on it further.\nMeanwhile, on the other end, Su Ping finally hung up after an eager chat with Li Shu. The last bit of his money had been sent over as the advertising fee.\nHe just hoped the ad's effect wouldn't disappoint him.\nWith that thought in mind, he glanced at the already slightly darkened sky outside and finally perked up.\nThose three bottles of the final Heart of Woods Magic Potion must have cooled down by now!\nHe would keep one bottle as a backup and for seed capital. The remaining two bottles would be for Little Ones and Xiao Qing to try!",

      "content": "Chapter 13 - 13: Methods of Cultivating Poison Type Mutations?\nIn the medical room, the fully recovered Little Ones excitedly watched the Magic Potion vessel in Su Ping's hand.\nIt recognized it. This was the thing that, after their king had consumed it, had instantly made him much stronger. The master of their king, standing right before it, truly hadn't deceived it!ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nClearly, Little Ones was not as finicky or intelligent as Old Sha. Or rather, Little Ones, stimulated by Xiao Qing's contemptuous gaze earlier that morning, now craved power above all else.\nSu Ping didn't hesitate. He took out the gel-like Heart of Woods Magic Potion and tossed the medicinal-scented, jelly-like substance directly into Little Ones' mouth.\nSu Ping had to admit he did have some ulterior motives; otherwise, he wouldn't have let Little Ones try out the effects first.\nAnd the result did not disappoint him.\nA low growl sounded, and the scene from that morning reoccurred. However, unlike Old Sha's brief transformation, Little Ones' current change lasted for a full ten minutes.\nEmerald starlight scattered, adhering to Little Ones' body.\nEven Xiao Qing, looking at this previously insignificant rival, showed a trace of solemnity in its small eyes. It sensed a dangerous aura from this opponent it had once easily defeated!\nIndeed, that was the case. The Wood Element Energy in the air began to condense. However, instead of Vine Strangling tendrils appearing, the slowly opening eyes of Little Ones revealed that its body had grown slightly larger.\nThis is... another Racial Skill of the Forest Wolf, Accelerated Growth?\nThe next moment, before Su Ping could get a good look at Little Ones' changes, the Forest Wolf Catalog provided feedback and a prompt:\n[Associated Pet Beast successfully acquired Skills: Heart of Woods, Accelerated Growth. Level promoted. Catalogue Experience +10 points!]\nThe experience gained this time was much less. It was unclear if this was because Little Ones' Level was too low, or if the repeated use of the Magic Potion had caused the Forest Wolf data acquired by the Catalog to become repetitive.\nHowever, Su Ping wasn't in the mood to care about that at the moment. His Eye of Truth looked at Little Ones as it was now:\n[Forest Wolf (Wild)]\n[Current Level: Ordinary Sixth Stage]\n[Racial Potential: Elite Tenth Stage]\n[Skills: Sunlight Absorption (Beginner), Accelerated Growth (Beginner), Heart of Woods (Beginner)]\nJust as expected!\nA look of joy appeared in Su Ping's eyes. Little Ones' Level had also advanced, and the degree of promotion was so significant that he hadn't even imagined that a single bottle of this Heart of Woods Magic Potion could directly elevate Little Ones from Ordinary Third Rank to Ordinary Sixth Stage.\nAs expected of a Magic Potion formula perfected by the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, and as expected of a Magic Potion made by me, the future Breeding Master!\nSu Ping was very satisfied and pleased with himself.\nBefore he could properly indulge in his self-satisfaction, his sleeve was tugged.\nAs expected, it was Xiao Qing. Seeing this rival it hadn't taken seriously—whose strength and aura had surpassed its own in such a short time—Xiao Qing became restless.\n\"WHINE... WHINE...\"\nLooking at his own rather unimpressive Pet Beast, Su Ping laughed, \"Don't worry, would you ever be shortchanged?\"\nHe opened the vial of Heart of Woods Magic Potion he had prepared. Xiao Qing, facing the Magic Potion whose pungent odor Old Sha had desperately avoided, swallowed it in one gulp.\nThe same faint green glow lit up, enveloping Xiao Qing in twinkling points of light. However, Su Ping's breathing became somewhat rapid at this moment.\nIt would be a lie to say I wasn't nervous; otherwise, I wouldn't have chosen to let Little Ones have a small taste first.\nBut although Little Ones had succeeded, Xiao Qing was not like the other Forest Wolves. Xiao Qing's Poison Type bloodline mutation already set it distinctly apart from them. The Heart of Woods Magic Potion was primarily Wood Attribute, and whether it would cause any other reactions in Xiao Qing was still unknown.\nSu Ping had long prepared for stomach lavage and had medical treatments ready in the medical room. He watched unblinkingly as Xiao Qing slowly began to change.\nThe same verdant specks of light covered Xiao Qing's body. Waves of power radiated from it.\nTime ticked by. Beads of sweat began to form on Su Ping's forehead. Little Ones had taken ten minutes to consume and digest the Magic Potion. However, fifteen minutes had now passed for Xiao Qing. Yet, the verdant light spots on Xiao Qing not only showed no signs of fading, but their color gradually deepened. The original emerald green transformed into a darker, forest green. It somewhat resembled the original color of the Heart of Woods Magic Potion.\nSu Ping grew restless. He kept his Eye of Truth almost constantly active, his gaze firmly locked on Xiao Qing. However, even the Eye of Truth could not completely analyze Xiao Qing's current condition. Fortunately, the life-monitoring instrument to the side showed Xiao Qing's vital signs remained perfectly stable, allowing Su Ping to breathe a small sigh of relief.\nFinally, just when Su Ping was growing quite impatient, the dark green specks of light seemed to suddenly complete their settling. A howl, neither loud nor retaining the immature, whimpering quality of its previous cries, resounded in the medical room.\nThe light spots disappeared, and Xiao Qing reappeared before Su Ping.\nHowever, this time, before Su Ping could properly use the Eye of Truth to examine Xiao Qing's changes, the Forest Wolf Catalog was a step ahead, providing the most unique feedback!\n[Successfully enabled the associated Pet Beast to acquire the Skill: Mutated Poison Wood Heart. Its Level increased, Racial Limit raised. Catalogue Experience +50 points!]\n[Preliminary analysis of the Poison Type Mutation in the Forest Wolf has been conducted. Consume 50,000 Experience Points from this Catalog to forcibly analyze the cause of the Forest Wolf's poison bloodline mutation and obtain the Cultivation method for this Mutation.]\nFeeling the feedback from the Forest Wolf Catalog within the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, even Su Ping blinked, momentarily unable to process it all.\nIsn't this a bit too much information to take in at once?\nHowever, previous feedback from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas had mentioned it was possible to analyze the cause of Xiao Qing's mutation. There was a certain chance of deciphering the bloodline mutation's cause by spending daily time with Xiao Qing to gain Experience Points. Su Ping hadn't expected this day to arrive so quickly.\nAlthough the glaring cost of 50,000 Catalogue Experience Points is quite steep, it's still something to look forward to, isn't it? If I could master the Cultivation method for the Forest Wolf's Poison Type Mutation, then my future expertise in the Cultivation and research regarding the Heart of Woods might truly make me, as my unreliable old father said, easily number one in Jianghai Province, or even the entire Dragon Nation!\nHowever, 50,000 Experience Points are still a long way off.\nSuppressing his excitement, Su Ping was even more eager to observe Xiao Qing's changes after consuming the Heart of Woods Magic Potion.",

      "content": "Chapter 14 - 14 Mutated Skill: Heart of the Poison Wood!\nMutated Skill.\nThis was something the school had taught as well. Some Pet Beasts, due to resources, growth environment, or even personality reasons, experience mutations in the skills they are supposed to awaken. These Mutated Skills can be strong or weak and cannot be generalized. And now, Xiao Qing was undoubtedly one such example.\nEye of Truth, upon inspecting Xiao Qing at this moment, had already provided Su Ping with feedback.\n[Mutated Forest Wolf (Contracted)]\n[Current Level: Ordinary Fourth Stage]\n[Racial Potential: Commander Third Rank]\n[Skills: Sunlight Absorption (Beginner), Poison Vine Strangulation (Beginner), Mutated Poison Wood Heart (Beginner)]\nEven though he was prepared, Su Ping couldn't help but draw in a sharp breath. The breakthrough to an Ordinary Fourth Stage was not surprising. In fact, this breakthrough was actually one rank lower than Little One's breakthrough. However, that was clearly not the crux of the issue. The real key point lay in the leap in Racial Potential!\nForest Wolves had the Racial Potential for the Elite Tier! Even Old Sha might have had all sorts of opportunities in the past to break through his Racial Potential and become the Commander Level he was today. But when observed through the Eye of Truth, Old Sha's Racial Potential, in fact, had not increased. This meant that Old Sha's breakthrough and advancement were a result of personal fortune, not a transformation of the race. Even if Old Sha had offspring, it wouldn't affect the race.\nBut Xiao Qing at this moment was different. After consuming the Heart of Woods and somehow completing the mutation, its Racial Potential had improved even further! Even without Evolution, even without needing to consume precious resources and Magic Potions, as long as Xiao Qing grew normally and wasn't too lazy, then in the future, it could break through to Commander Level!\nFor a moment, Su Ping fell into deep thought.\nWas the effect of the Heart of Woods so ridiculous?\nLooking at it this way, if someone really did come to him for training, could he set his prices quite a bit higher?\nHowever, Su Ping also understood that the effect of the Heart of Woods Magic Potion was one aspect, but Xiao Qing's incredible talent was another. Although there was no change in the skill level displayed on the panel, through the Soul Contract, he could clearly feel that Xiao Qing's Poison Vine Strangulation had greatly improved.\nThe gap in proficiency between each skill level was considerable. This was also the main reason why Beast Tamers and their Pet Beasts had to constantly practice and cultivate them. And certainly, the improvement in the might of the attack-oriented Poison Vine Strangulation was a primary direction for enhancement.\nIt was a pity that there was no suitable opponent to battle right now. Shaking his head, Su Ping finally turned the Eye of Truth towards Xiao Qing's main mutation: this rare and precious Mutated Skill!\n[Mutated Poison Wood Heart (Beginner): A special Mutated Skill that combines the characteristics of the Poison Type with the Wood Element's Heart of Woods. It enhances the activation effect, power, and casting time of Poison Type and Wood Element skills. Additionally, it can absorb the essence of plant power to restore itself and can also use Poison System Resources to accelerate its own Realm and the Skill Proficiency improvement of this specific skill.]\nSu Ping blinked, and the effect of the Eye of Truth vanished. Yet, he didn't snap back to reality for quite some time. Even though the school had said that Mutated Skills could either become more powerful and strange or weaker, without a doubt, Xiao Qing's \"Mutated Poison Wood Heart\" was clearly one of the mutations that had become more powerful. But Su Ping had never imagined it would be so powerful.\nOther aspects aside, the fact that it could enhance the power of Poison Type skills—an effect analogous to the Heart of Woods' general enhancing properties for its own element—was already remarkable. However, the subsequent ability listed was what Su Ping truly hadn't anticipated.\nCould it really speed up the improvement of one's Realm and Skill Proficiency by consuming Poison System Resources and related materials?\nAlthough Su Ping had previously thought about making money to buy some Poison System Resources for Xiao Qing to consume and fully exploit its Poison Type abilities, there was a certain risk involved. Why are Poison Type Pet Beasts so rare? It's because often, the use of Poison Type Pet Beasts and Poison System Resources can be fatal to the pets if slightly overdosed.\nHowever, now with this Mutated Poison Wood Heart, does it mean that Xiao Qing has gained an additional layer of insurance?\nAt this thought, Su Ping's eyes burst with an excited flame. He picked up Xiao Qing, still intoxicated by its newfound strength, and planted a kiss on the greenish wolf's head.\nAs expected, the price of a Pet Beast with a mutated bloodline far exceeds that of others, and this was precisely why. With Pet Beasts whose bloodlines have mutated, no one knows their limits, and they can sometimes give their owners unexpected and delightful surprises—like now, for instance.\nThinking of this, Su Ping longed even more for the Forest Wolf Catalog's mutation that requires a whopping 50,000 points of Catalog Experience—the reason behind the Forest Wolf's poison bloodline mutation.\nAll of a sudden, Su Ping, feeling somewhat worn out from making three batches of Heart of Woods Magic Potions, seemed to have regained his energy. He directly took Little One, who had returned to its normal size after retracting the 'Accelerated Growth' skill, and headed outside the manor's forest.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ NovᴇlFirenᴇt\nPutting other affairs aside for the moment, he decided to properly train Xiao Qing in combat and practice its skills. And he would ensure the other twenty-plus Forest Wolves bonded with him to the required level; once they did, upgrading the Forest Wolf Catalog would become much faster!\nSpeaking of which, the Forest Wolf Catalog had already reached (222/500) Experience Points after the breakthroughs of Xiao Qing and Little One. It was a big step closer to reaching Forest Wolf Catalog LV: 2!\nWatching the wolf pack lounging lazily under the twilight sun, led by Old Sha, Su Ping's spirits lifted, and he called out to the wolves, \"For Heart of Woods to become the world's number one Pet Beast Breeding Base! For me to become the top Breeding Master in Dragon Nation! Forest Wolves, give me your love tackle!\"\n\"AWOO...\"\n\"AWOO...\"\nThe only ones to respond were Xiao Qing and Little One; the rest, including Old Sha, looked at their young master with a gaze usually reserved for the mentally challenged.\nLaughing, Su Ping didn't mind and pulled out some tree fruit from the Beast Taming Space that he had prepared earlier. The Forest Wolves had their main meals provided automatically by a feeder. However, these little ones liked the dessert after dinner, which was clearly Su Ping's whim.\nUnsurprisingly, the quick-to-adapt Forest Wolves, seeing the several large tubs of snacks and fruits, promptly came running over, shamelessly ready to sit in rows and share the treats.",

      "content": "Chapter 15 - 15: The Beast Tamer Who Scoops Poop, The First Customer!\nThe clear sky stretched endlessly, and the boundless sunlight poured down. The midday sun penetrated the leaves, creating dappled traces on the ground.\nThe Forest Wolves were either chasing and playing with each other or lazing under the trees, basking in the sun without becoming overly hot.\nThere were some exceptions, however, namely Xiao Qing and Little Ones.\nIn the sunlit jungle, the two little ones were truly using Skills to battle and practice.\nAfter all, improving Skill Proficiency Levels was one of the main ways to enhance strength.\nAs for Old Sha, he watched over the two little ones to prevent any accidents.\nThe entire Heart of Woods Pet Beast Breeding Base seemed exceptionally light-hearted.\nThere was only one person, and he was the only human in this Pet Beast Breeding Base.\nAt the moment, Su Ping was not only unrelaxed but also quite speechless.\nUnder the scorching sun, he held a pair of specially made tweezers. The heat caused beads of sweat to form at his temples.\nDespite this, he still wore a mask, crouched to one side with tweezers in hand and a bamboo basket on his back.\nAn indescribable stench wafted from in front of him.\nAlthough it was not as overpowering as when making a Magic Potion, it was definitely enough to make people cover their noses and keep their distance.Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nAfter picking up a pile of wolf feces that looked like wood shavings and tossing it into the bamboo basket, Su Ping sighed behind his mask.\nIt wasn't because of the foul stench of the wolf feces. After all, he had grown accustomed to it after so many days, and the results weren't bad.\nHe didn't know why the Forest Wolves bonded faster with him when he smelled of their feces, but a few days of experimentation had proven it true.\nHe was extremely grateful that his own Pet Beast Breeding Base was a haven for Forest Wolves, which were pack creatures.\nWithin a wolf pack, there is a Wolf King, whose dominance over the pack is unquestionable.\nAnd since Old Sha, as the Wolf King, had a relationship with him akin to family, the other Forest Wolves naturally followed suit under Old Sha's influential and authoritative rule.\nAdded to that was the Su Family's recorded knowledge of Forest Wolf habits.\nOver these past few days, all the Forest Wolves, except for the few at the Elite Level, had reached the standard intimacy level with him, and the Forest Wolf Catalog had included them.\nAlthough these ordinary Forest Wolves, with no particular highlights, contributed very limited experience to his Forest Wolf Catalog, the time spent with them and the experience gained in the past few days had also reached just over four hundred.\nApproximately, in a few more days, or after reaching the standard intimacy level with those few Elite Level wolves, I can probably upgrade the Forest Wolf Catalog to LV2.\nHe sighed purely because he was somewhat distressed about his family's money.\nLi Shu was right. Who even looks at local news these days? The effect of local media advertising is just too poor.\nAfter so many days, only a few people had called to inquire.\nAnd as soon as they heard it was a Pet Beast Breeding Base with no reputation, run by someone who didn't even have a Junior Breeder certificate, the conversations decisively ended.\nSo, Su Ping felt he had been hasty.\nThe advertisement was pointless. If it weren't for that last sliver of hope, I would have used up the last bottle of Magic Potion and called it quits.\nFortunately, however, besides the Forest Wolf Catalog, he hadn't been without other gains these past few days.\nThe most direct improvement, among others, was the advancement in his Realm.\nThe advancement in a Beast Tamer's Realm mainly depended on feedback from improving Contracted Beasts, using special resources, and the most common foundation: meditation.\nThis aspect, besides one's natural Beast Taming Talent, was also a test of a Beast Tamer's Ability.\nAnd Su Ping had much to say in this regard.\nHis meditation progress had always been the best among the six. He didn't know if it was due to his two lifetimes of experience or the hidden effects of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas.\nMoreover, from his knowledge of Controlling Beasts, he knew that after contracting a soul-bound Pet Beast, the effects and progress of meditation would be much faster.\nLooking back now, it indeed seems so.\nIn just a few days of meditation, Su Ping had advanced from an Ordinary Fourth Stage to an Ordinary Fifth Stage.\nXiao Qing had also made some progress. Although it didn't advance a Level, its strength had improved considerably.\nShaking his head, he placed this batch of wolf feces in the forest. Forest Wolf feces promoted plant growth, making them a sort of low-cost special resource.\nIt was precisely because of this that the plants in his forest grew so well.\nWhen I become wealthy in the future, should I consider Cultivating some Plant-based Pet Beasts? After all, the Forest Wolves provide such good conditions right here.\nSu Ping pondered with wry amusement amidst his struggles.\nUnfortunately, as soon as this thought emerged, Su Ping sighed.\nIt's the same problem again—no money!\nEndowed with dragon-slaying skills but unrecognized, the frustrated Su Ping, a great Beast Tamer, finished cleaning up the mess. He had no mood to play with these \"silly dogs\" and headed straight toward the manor.\nHowever, just as he arrived, he heard a DING-DONG, DING-DONG sound from the door.\nIt was urgent yet prolonged, clearly being pressed continuously.\nIs it Manager Guan again? Or perhaps one of my classmates, who, except for Li Shu, hasn't bothered to keep in touch?\nSu Ping didn't bother guessing and went straight to the door.\n\"I'm coming, I'm coming! Stop pressing it!\"\nWhen the door opened, the person who appeared before him made Su Ping pause.\nIt was a woman who looked to be in her twenties, slightly older than him, wearing sunglasses. Even so, Su Ping could still make out her snow-white complexion and the suppressed anger on her cheeks.\nOf course, there was also the way she instinctively covered her delicate nose.\n\"You are...?\"\nBefore Su Ping could finish his question, the woman had already started berating him.\n\"What kind of Pet Beast Breeding Base is this? How do you even do business? I've been pressing this doorbell for nearly an hour! I can't believe I actually found this godforsaken place...\"\nFaced with the woman's anger, undoubtedly built up from pressing the doorbell under the scorching sun for so long, Su Ping quickly interrupted her.\n\"Um, are you here to train your Pet Beast's Skills?\"\n\"Duh! Why else would I come to this godforsaken corner?\"\nWith that, the woman took off her sunglasses, revealing a face that even Su Ping found quite stunning.\nWhat a beautiful young lady.\nToo bad,\nSu Ping thought with regret.\nSuch a pretty young lady, but her brain doesn't seem to work too well.\n\"I'm sorry, I was just taking care of the Pet Beasts. Have you been waiting long? Did no one respond when you rang the doorbell?\"\n\"What do you think? Did you think I was lying?\"\nSu Ping quickly waved his hands. He could understand the frustration of waiting a long time for someone to open the door, but...\nSu Ping looked conflicted, unsure how to put it.\nInstead, it was the young lady before him who, looking suspiciously at this man reeking of wolf feces and his expression, asked, \"What is it?\"\nSu Ping pursed his lips before finally saying, \"If you were really in a hurry, you could have called the number on the signboard or the advertisement.\"\nThe woman opened her mouth, then looked up at the phone number on the signboard and fell into an awkward silence.\nAt that moment, Su Ping felt somewhat certain.\nThis might be my first, and only, walk-in customer... and her brain might not be working too well.",

The Terrifying Profits of Pet Beast Cultivation!\nUnder the sunlight, the entrance of the Heart of Woods was extremely quiet.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nOnly the sound of two or three chirping cicadas could be heard.\nIn the end, Su Ping broke the silence, \"Please come in and take a seat.\"\nThe girl's slightly flushed face finally looked a bit better as she entered the reception room.\nSu Ping took the fastest bath of his life before stepping through the door.\nThis time, the girl's eyes lit up.\nDespite a poor first impression, Su Ping's reappearance surprised her.\nHe had a handsome appearance, infused with a sense of steadiness uncommon for his age.\nCompared to the unbearably arrogant, so-called campus heartthrobs and young elites at the Magic Capital Beast Taming Academy, he was far more pleasant to look at.\nEven on the street, he was the type of person she would glance at several times.\nBut obviously, she wasn't here to admire handsome men.\nAlthough the sight of the handsome young man had somewhat soothed the impatience brought on by her long wait, she still said with a cold expression, \"Enough, can your facility cultivate the Forest Wolf's 'Heart of Woods' skill? Call out your Breeder; I'll talk to him.\"\nSu Ping sat down directly. \"Let me introduce myself. I am Su Ping, the owner and Beast Tamer of the Heart of Woods Pet Beast Breeding Base.\"\nThe girl was stunned for a moment. Then, her eyebrows knitted slightly, her expression turned cold, and she even revealed a hint of mockery, \"Does that also include being a janitor and a poop scooper?\"\nWithout waiting for Su Ping's response, she stood up and said, \"Never mind, I'll take my leave.\"\nHe had anticipated all of this. In a world where people judge by appearance, it was unfair to an excellent Breeder and genius Beast Tamer like himself.\nBut there was no helping it; a penny can stump a hero, as the saying goes.\nHaving finally encountered a customer who didn't seem to have all her wits about her, Su Ping couldn't just let her walk away.\n\"You don't believe me?\"\nIf the young man before her hadn't been so pleasing to the eye, she obviously wouldn't have looked back. After hearing his words, the woman turned around. \"Judging by your age, you must have just graduated, right? Do you even know what the Heart of Woods skill is?\"\nBefore Su Ping could respond, she continued, \"Heart of Woods is a passive, amplifying skill. It's a Sub-Rank Skill of the Super-Rank Skill 'Heart of Elements,' which only Wood Element Elemental Type Pet Beasts have a chance to comprehend on their own.\nOther Wood Element Pet Beasts, let alone Forest Wolves—even Plant-based Pet Beasts with Racial Potential like the Life Ancient Tree that have reached Monarch Level rarely possess it.\nAlthough Linzhou is the birthplace of Forest Wolf breeding, when it comes to cultivating the Heart of Woods, I didn't hold out much hope to begin with. Sorry for the disturbance.\"\nAfter speaking, the woman shook her head, a self-deprecating, almost amused smile on her face.\nHowever, Su Ping looked at the woman, his expression unwavering, still calm and confidently composed. He said calmly, \"Why not give it a try?\"\nThe woman was taken aback. She glanced at this young Beast Tamer who had clearly just graduated.\nMeeting her scrutinizing gaze, Su Ping smiled slightly. \"If you're willing to give it a try, as long as the Heart of Woods isn't cultivated, you won't have to spend a single penny on any preliminary fees or material costs!\"\nAt this statement, the woman was truly shocked.\nTypically, for Pet Beast Breeding Bases, especially those that specialize in skill Cultivation, there are two crucial conditions.\nFirst and foremost, the Pet Beast's safety must be guaranteed.\nGenerally, this isn't a major concern, because when a Pet Beast is in danger, its Beast Tamer can sense it and stop the Cultivation at any time.\nMoreover, contracts usually include a clause stating that if a Pet Beast dies, not only will the breeding base be shut down, but the Breeder might even face prison time.\nTherefore, not just anyone can become a Breeder. Without a certificate from the Breeder Association, it was understandable that people wouldn't trust Su Ping.\nSecondly, before Cultivation, regardless of success or failure, the client Beast Tamer has to bear certain costs.\nAfter all, even those few Breeding Masters cannot guarantee success every time.\nA breeding base isn't a charity; expecting to pay only upon success is unrealistic.\nYet, the young man before her dared to make such a statement.\nIs he planning to use me as a guinea pig?\nYet, at this moment, she hesitated. There was an inexplicably convincing and steady aura about the young man before her.\nAnd she did indeed have a compelling reason for her Pet Beast to comprehend the Heart of Woods.\nOf course, perhaps it was also because her way of thinking wasn't quite the same as an ordinary person's?\nBesides, she didn't believe that someone running such a large breeding base wouldn't understand the consequences of causing trouble.\nThus, her interest was piqued.\n\"Qin Xiaoxue!\"\nSu Ping, surprised by the pale hand extended towards him, reached out and shook it gently.\nQin Xiaoxue, however, remained direct. \"Since you're the one who made the offer, don't say I'm taking advantage of you. If it's not successful, and Woodhead doesn't learn Heart of Woods after the Cultivation, you won't get a single penny!\nIf you succeed, besides the agreed-upon price, I'll grant you one request, whatever it may be. How about that wager?\"\nSu Ping's reply was equally straightforward.\nHe immediately printed out the contract.\nQin Xiaoxue might have seemed scatterbrained, but she was meticulous when it came to reading contracts.\nShe pointed to a section. \"I just said, on top of the price to be paid, I can agree to one of your conditions. But here, the Cultivation fee is only three million five hundred thousand!\"\nSu Ping just smiled. \"You're the first person to trust me. If it fails, the materials are free, and I don't need any other conditions from you.\"\nSu Ping, having lived two lives, was worldly-wise. He could tell that this Miss Qin before him was likely no ordinary person.\nIndeed, not many would bat an eye at such a Cultivation price.\nBut right now, he just needed money and didn't want to deal with unnecessary complications.\nThis price was already making his conscience prickle.\nA cost of two hundred thousand for nearly twenty times the profit.\nWhile for a Beast Tamer who could easily afford this price, it was absolutely a bargain, Su Ping, conducting this kind of business for the first time, still felt somewhat uncomfortable.\nAfter all, becoming a qualified, cold-hearted capitalist also required a certain talent.\nQin Xiaoxue looked at Su Ping with a complicated expression. Her promise, in truth, was of a value that couldn't be measured by a mere three million five hundred thousand, let alone thirty-five million.\nHowever, this very young Beast Tamer had left an extraordinarily unusual impression on her.\nConsequently, Qin Xiaoxue found herself irrationally harboring an unrealistic fantasy.\nCould he really do it?",

      "content": "Chapter 17 - 17: The Top Match Forest Wolf! Linzhou Has Such a Breeder?\nSu Ping's father, his family's unreliable old man, had once told him: \"Women will only hinder your future in Controlling Beasts. But rich women are different; they'll buy you a better Pet Beast.\"\nSu Ping acknowledged the truth in his father's words.\nAs for Qin Xiaoxue before him, Su Ping believed in his judgment. Her background was likely anything but ordinary.\nHowever, after seeing the Forest Wolf she called 'Woodhead,' Su Ping knew he regretted it.\nHe regretted having refused Qin Xiaoxue's offer to name a condition, just to show off.\nForest Wolves differed from one another.\nFor instance, the one following them.\nThis was an adult Forest Wolf as tall as Su Ping's chest—a giant.\nUncommonly majestic, its eyes were filled with disdain and arrogance for everything around it.\nThe Eye of Truth gave Su Ping the most direct understanding.\n[Forest Wolf (Contracted - Others)]\n[Current Level: Elite Tenth Stage]\n[Racial Potential: Elite Tenth Stage]\n[Skills: Sunlight Absorption (Proficient), Vine Strangling (Proficient), Self-Healing (Beginner), Accelerated Growth (Proficient), Armor of Wood (Proficient), Wood Spike (Proficient), Forest Concealment Technique (Beginner)]\nNot only had this Forest Wolf mastered all its Racial Skills, but it also possessed three additional ones.\nEspecially the Forest Concealment Technique. While its rarity didn't match Heart of Woods, it wasn't far off.\nWhat kind of luxury, top-tier Forest Wolf is this?\nThɪs NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nThe cost of raising such a beast could probably buy several Commander Level Pet Beast cubs.\nThat's just too wasteful!\nHowever, Su Ping also understood something. This Miss Qin before him was by no means fixated on just the Forest Wolf; rather, she had already prepared which Evolutionary path the Forest Wolf would take.\nSu Ping shook his head, showed Qin Xiaoxue around his breeding facility, and explained the final details, \"The Cultivation will take about five days. During this time, as the Pet Beast's owner, you may only see it once a day. If you're worried, you can stay next door. If you sense through the Soul Contract that Woodhead is in any danger, you can come over immediately.\"\nListening to Su Ping's detailed arrangements, Qin Xiaoxue nodded. She always believed in trusting those she employed and not using those she distrusted.\nAfter signing the contract and settling all arrangements, she instructed 'Woodhead' to behave and then left directly.\nSeeing the mechanical sports car summoned and then vanishing in a flash, Su Ping felt a tinge of envy.\nBut looking at the proud 'Woodhead' beside him, Su Ping revealed a hint of a smile.\nFor him, simply administering a Magic Potion to the Pet Beast would be considered completing the Cultivation.\nHowever, now that he finally had a test subject, Su Ping naturally wanted to experiment. For example, could he incorporate a Forest Wolf contracted by someone else into his own Forest Wolf Catalog?\nAlthough it didn't mean much; after all, raising Experience Points would mainly depend on nurturing it in the future.\nBut there was no harm in trying.\nSeeing Su Ping's beaming smile, Woodhead lifted its proud head and glanced with disdain at this weak human Beast Tamer trusted by its owner.\nAs Su Ping extended his hand, it instinctively tried to evade. However, without it noticing, a majestic wolf exuding Wolf King Majesty suddenly appeared beside Su Ping. Woodhead shuddered and didn't dare to dodge again.\n\"Good boy! Behave!\" Su Ping said.\n「...」\nQin Xiaoxue, who had left, obviously didn't know that her Pet Beast had become someone's test subject.\nNow, that extremely mobile mechanical sports car, even slightly levitating due to magnetic suspension, had left the suburbs of Linzhou City and arrived at the city center.\nIt stopped in front of a central building.\nThis building was located in the best area of Linzhou, yet no one dared to poke their nose into its affairs.\nThis was because, atop the building, a golden Divine Dragon coiled and hovered.\nTo one side were five large characters:\nBeast Master Association!\nNext to these large characters was a line of smaller print:\nJianghai Province Branch.\nHaving put the sports car back into her Beast Taming Space, Qin Xiaoxue's face turned ice cold. She rode the elevator to the top floor, arrived in front of an office, and kicked the door open.\nBANG!\nBehind the large desk in the spacious office sat a very well-maintained old man. He was startled by the dull thud of the door being kicked open, so much that the tea in his cup spilled out.\nLooking at the spilled tea leaves, the old man winced. His gaze, filled with unrestrained icy killing intent, fixed on the newcomer. However, it softened in an instant, and he coughed a few times, \"Xiao Xue, why are you back? Didn't you go to Shuhua City?\"\nQin Xiaoxue sneered and sat down on the sofa opposite him, crossed her legs, and said nothing, just watching the old man.\nFaced with his granddaughter's murderous gaze, the old man's eyelids began to flutter rapidly.\nFinally, as the old man grew restless, Qin Xiaoxue spoke, \"Qin Erlong, you're quite something now, helping outsiders scam your own granddaughter?!\"\nThe old man blinked. Seeing Qin Xiaoxue suddenly stand up and fiercely slap her hand against his desk, spilling more tea from the cup, he quickly said before he had time to fret, \"What happened?\"\n\"Tell me! What benefits did that damn Wolf Den Breeding Facility give you? They took three million from me, not only failed to teach Woodhead 'Accelerated Casting,' but also made my Woodhead have diarrhea for three days! Qin Erlong, if you don't give me an explanation today, I'll go back to the Magic Capital and have the old madam see justice done!\"\nSeeing his granddaughter's fury, and as if he thought of something even more terrifying, the old man quickly said, his voice filled with righteous indignation, \"What? That Old Liu! How is he managing his duties as Vice President of the Breeder Association, recommending such unreliable people? Xiao Xue, you wait! Watch your grandfather get justice for you! I'll have that damn Wolf Den Breeding Facility shut down!\"\nWith that, the old man immediately reached for the phone, clearly about to make a call.\nBut Qin Xiaoxue snatched it directly from him, saying, \"You old coot, do you take me for some spoiled brat who bullies people? We signed a contract before the Cultivation. Your granddaughter isn't someone who can't afford to lose or welch on a deal.\n\"What's the point of calling them now? If word gets back to the Magic Capital, do you want me to become a laughingstock?\"\nThe old man wore a bitter expression and said helplessly, \"Then what do we do now? The Evolution path for the 'Crown Wolf Emperor' you want to cultivate requires the Forest Wolf to master eight Skills just to begin. Now...\"\nQin Xiaoxue hummed proudly, \"On my way back, I found another breeding facility. They claim they can help my Woodhead cultivate 'Heart of Woods.' Don't worry about that for now. You introduced the last one, so you should at least offer some compensation for my emotional distress, right?\"\nThe old man's eyelids began to twitch wildly. Sure enough, Qin Xiaoxue immediately noticed the fragrance of the tea in his cup.\nJust the scent was enough to clear her head and soothe her heart.\n\"Tsk, tea from the Spiritual Ancient Tea Tree!\"\nThe old man chuckled awkwardly and hastily tried to put away the nearby jade box. However, facing his granddaughter's icy stare, he reluctantly offered it.\n\"Hmph, that's more like it. I'll let it go this time.\"\nAfter his granddaughter left, satisfied with her shakedown, the old man breathed a sigh of relief. Then, his brows furrowed slightly once more.\nWhat did my dear granddaughter just say?\nShe found a breeding facility that could help a Forest Wolf comprehend Heart of Woods?\nIsn't that utter nonsense?\nAfter giving it some thought, the old man still picked up the phone.\nIs there really such a breeding facility and Breeder in Linzhou? Why haven't I heard of it before?\nMy granddaughter, so hot-tempered yet actually a bit straightforward and simple... she hasn't been tricked, has she?",

      "content": "Chapter 18 - 18 Catalog Upgrade! Forest Wolf LV2!\n\"Uncle Guan, I've really been quite busy these past few days. In a couple of days, I'll definitely come by personally,\" Su Ping said helplessly in the reception room to an even more helpless Manager Guan.\n\"Xiao Ping, look at this. How many days has it been? It's summer vacation now, and aside from students like you graduating, quite a few Beast Tamers from various places have also returned to Linzhou. Business has been good lately, and we're really running short of Low-level Pet Beasts. How about this? I'll take the initiative and increase the previous price by twenty percent. How's that for a deal?\"\nIf this had been before, Manager Guan's offer would have really tempted Su Ping. After all, aside from the money, it would also allow his Pet Beasts to gain real battle experience, which was beneficial no matter what.\nBut these days, he simply didn't have the time. He had devoted all his energy to Woodhead.\nThis was, after all, a deal worth several million.\nHow much could leasing Pet Beasts possibly earn him?\nSeeing Su Ping's steadfast attitude, Manager Guan felt helpless.\nWas he really here for something as trivial as leasing Pet Beasts?\nTianyun Group's influence in Jianghai Province was significant.\nLeasing some Low-level Pet Beasts shouldn't be a problem, right?\nThe reason he was maintaining this relationship with Su Ping was to butter him up for the subsequent purchase of this land deed.\nAlas, this kid seemed to be more troublesome than Su Anyong.\nManager Guan had a premonition that it would be quite difficult for his company's chairman to achieve his goal smoothly.\nShaking his head, Manager Guan could only leave in resignation.\nHowever, just as he stepped out of the Heart of Woods, Manager Guan saw a woman wearing sunglasses also coming in. Manager Guan nodded in recognition, realizing it was a guest who had been staying at their place these past few days, and he didn't think much of it.\nThe person who had arrived was none other than Qin Xiaoxue.\nQin Xiaoxue, despite her carefree personality, was not actually foolish. To leave her Pet Beast so far away, she, as the owner, wouldn't be able to respond in time if something happened. Besides, it was merely a matter of a few days.\nAnd it must be said that the rural area around Lingxi River, although not as convenient as the city center, possessed a kind of bucolic beauty that's hard to come by.\n\"I didn't expect your small patch of land to be so in demand, is it?\" Qin Xiaoxue said to Su Ping with a laugh.\nIndeed, Qin Xiaoxue had been visiting frequently these past few days. Although she would only see Woodhead once a day, strictly adhering to the requirements, she spent quite a long time lingering in the Heart of Woods. Su Ping had grown somewhat familiar with this mysterious young lady of esteemed background. However, today he really wasn't in the mood to entertain her properly.\nThe reason was simple: in the days he spent on Cultivation, aside from his time with Woodhead, Su Ping had not been idle with the other Forest Wolves at all!\nSince the moment Su Ping had activated the Forest Wolf Catalog and taken full control over the Heart of Woods, so many days had passed. And as of today, all of his Forest Wolves, except for one last one, had reached the required intimacy level and had been added to the Forest Wolf Catalog. At the same time, the Experience Points on the Forest Wolf Catalog were at 499/500!\nIn other words, if he spent one more day with these Forest Wolves, the Forest Wolf Catalog would be able to level up to LV2! Alternatively, if that last one—the highest-Level one apart from Old Sha, the one that had reached Elite Ninth Order—managed to achieve the required intimacy Level, then Su Ping, who had been longing and yearning for this day, could finally fulfill his desires.\nAt this moment, how could he possibly care about Qin Xiaoxue?\nIf it weren't for the fact that he'd known Uncle Guan for many years, that Uncle Guan had a good relationship with his father, and that he needed to give him some face, Su Ping wouldn't have even spared ten minutes to deal with him.\n\"I'm busy today. Just take a look at your Woodhead and then head back,\" Su Ping said, waving his hand dismissively. Then, without paying further attention to Qin Xiaoxue, he dashed toward the forest.\nLooking doubtfully at Su Ping, who seemed even more hurried than herself, Qin Xiaoxue wasn't bothered. She glanced at Woodhead through the monitor. These past few days, Woodhead had been frolicking in the woods with the Wolf Pack, showing no intention of training—just eating and drinking. Not only had it not been mistreated, but Qin Xiaoxue even felt the little fellow might have gained a few pounds.\nPerhaps it was just her imagination?\nShaking her head, Qin Xiaoxue didn't bother further. She had previously signed a contract with Su Ping, so if he failed to fulfill it, it was his loss. All she needed to ensure was that her Woodhead hadn't sustained any injuries.\nWith Su Ping gone, there was clearly no point for her to stay, so after looking for a while, she went back to the adjacent Yuntian Resort. Compared to Su Ping's Beast Taming base, the resort's environment and scenery were much nicer. When she had nothing better to do, Qin Xiaoxue indeed liked to take a few extra rounds there.\nHowever, she had never visited the main building—a huge structure occupying a large area, which also housed the main Pet Beast battle arena. Today, with nothing particular to do, Qin Xiaoxue casually walked towards it.\nIn the main building's arena, there were public battle spaces where Beast Tamers of various strengths were engaging in Pet Beast battles. However, to Qin Xiaoxue, they all seemed rather amateurish. Most were either graduates who hadn't undergone systematic Beast Taming and combat training or prospective Beast Tamers who had not passed professional assessments. Compared to the battles at the Magic Capital Advanced Beast-Taming Academy, these were far inferior.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ\nQin Xiaoxue had no interest in such fights.\nHowever, just as she was about to leave the building, she paused, her peripheral vision, behind sunglasses, glancing towards the side. The middle-aged man who had just been with Su Ping was now servilely following a woman. The woman was exceptionally beautiful, and even Qin Xiaoxue had to admit that she exuded something known as feminine charm. Most importantly, the woman's aura... Qin Xiaoxue thought for a moment and found a comparison: it was somewhat similar to the aura her father exuded.\nSeemingly noticing Qin Xiaoxue's scrutiny, the woman turned her head and glanced over, then didn't give it another thought. Qin Xiaoxue, however, furrowed her brows tighter after seeing the woman's face; she suddenly felt a sense of familiarity.\nBut before she could take a closer look, the woman entered a private elevator. After the woman went in, the middle-aged man, standing at the elevator entrance, whispered, \"Chairwoman, Su Ping still disagrees and shows no intention of relenting.\"\nAs the elevator closed, the voice disappeared as well.\nQin Xiaoxue stopped in her tracks and removed her sunglasses, her deep black eyebrows furrowing even tighter.\nChairwoman? Did that man's visit to Su Ping have something to do with her?\nAnd that woman... she looked so familiar!\nRemembering the man's words, Qin Xiaoxue pondered for a moment before taking out her phone.\nMeanwhile, Su Ping, obviously oblivious to these events and in no mind to concern himself with them, rode atop the last Elite Ninth Order Forest Wolf, affectionately feeding it the canned meat he had made according to the \"Breeding Manual\"—a favorite of the Forest Wolves.\nFinally, under Su Ping's meticulous care, a message appeared in the Forest Wolf Catalog of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas in his mind:\n[Adult Forest Wolf discovered, intimacy level meets requirements, Catalog Experience +15!]\n[This Forest Wolf is an adult. Subsequently, each day spent with it will yield +1 Catalog Experience for the Forest Wolf Catalog!]\n[Forest Wolf Catalog Experience Points: 514/500! Experience Points meet the Catalog upgrade requirements. Would you like to upgrade?]",

      "content": "Chapter 19 - 19: Connect and Share! A New Cultivation Business?\n\"Yes!\" Su Ping responded instantly, feeling the prompts from within the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas without a second thought.\nIn that moment, the Forest Wolf Catalog within the Atlas, which unfolded in his mind, suddenly magnified. The catalog, already filled with white light, flared brilliantly.\nA change slowly emerged from the top of this Forest Wolf Catalog; a hint of green seemed to spread from its uppermost edge. On this card-like Forest Wolf Catalog, the overall color transformed. The card, with its previous white base, slowly turned green—a world of difference compared to before.\nAt this moment, Su Ping felt an extremely special sensation. He seemed to gain an instinctive familiarity with the Forest Wolf, understanding the meaning behind its cries and the significance of its subtle movements. Even more so, after the Forest Wolf Catalog upgraded to LV2, the Forest Wolf before him seemed to regard him with greater affection and goodwill.\nSu Ping instantly understood.\nCould it be that leveling up the corresponding Pet Beast Compendiums within the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas enhances the Pet Beast's affection toward me while also deepening my understanding of them? If that's the case, it could save a lot of effort.\nHowever, these were clearly just perks, minor matters at best.\nThe most important thing is what I gain from the Forest Wolf Catalog in the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas after it upgrades to LV2!\n[Catalog 'Forest Wolf' level up, current catalog level: 2, awarded with Origin reward: Bonding Share (Forest Wolf)]\nSure enough, as the catalog in the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas completely transformed into a green-backed card, feedback from the Atlas emerged in Su Ping's mind.\nHowever, this time, the reward left Su Ping slightly startled. He had originally assumed that the reward for illuminating the Forest Wolf Catalog for the first time—a Beast Tamer talent like Eye of Truth—would be similar to the rewards for catalog level-ups. To his surprise, this Bonding Share was something he had never even heard of.\nCould it be an unheard-of talented ability?\nSu Ping's brow furrowed slightly.\nFortunately, as if sensing Su Ping's confusion, the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas immediately provided him with direct feedback:\n[Bonding Share (Forest Wolf): An ability birthed from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas. Allows the Tamer to bond and share with Forest Wolves included in the Catalog, provided their affinity meets the criteria. The bonded Forest Wolves share experience gained from skill training, usage, and enhancement.]\n[Note 1: The Master of the Catalog may cancel the bonding at any time. Forest Wolves too far from the Beast Tamer cannot be bonded.]\n[Note 2: The current Beast Tamer level can bond with up to 15 Forest Wolves simultaneously.]\n[Note 3: If bonded Forest Wolves do not possess the corresponding skills, they cannot gain shared experience effects.]\nLooking at this ability, and the almost instinctual understanding that came with it, Su Ping was momentarily dumbfounded.\nThis ability, although it seems only applicable to Forest Wolves, has a heaven-defying effect! Compared to the Eye of Truth, which can only be used for observation, its practicality is much broader—even terrifying. What does this mean?\nActually, it was quite simple. From the feedback of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas and Su Ping's dawning realization, he understood he could have 15 Forest Wolves bond and share. Then, these 15 Forest Wolves could simultaneously train the 'Vine Strangling' skill.\nGenerally, the speed at which each Forest Wolf improved in such training would depend on its own talent and aptitude. However, with this connection, the skill training speed for each Forest Wolf effectively increased fifteenfold.\nAnd if there were extremely hardworking ones, like a little one, or one with exceptionally high talent, like my own Pet Beast Xiao Qing, the effect would be even more astounding!\nThe levels of skill cultivation are divided into Beginner, Proficiency, Proficient, Perfection, and Divine Perfection. Almost every skill level upgrade brings an unimaginable enhancement to a Pet Beast's combat capabilities. Even the significant hurdle from Proficient to Perfection, if it were a Forest Wolf's main combat skill like 'Vine Strangling,' the improvement could be more terrifying than the difference between several realms!\nIndeed, the level of some skills is linked to a Pet Beast's evolution and the upper limit of its racial potential. Take Old Sha, for example; it's very likely he reached the Commander Level and comprehended Wolf King Majesty only by cultivating Sunlight Absorption to Perfection, thereby breaking through his race limit.\nAs for the final level, Divine Perfection? That level of skill cultivation can't be forced. Some Pet Beasts can only reach that realm by bringing their skills to their peak and then experiencing a serendipitous moment of epiphany.\nAnd now, with this ability, could I one day bring all the skills of all my Forest Wolves to the Perfection realm?! If that were the case, it would be truly terrifying.\nPreviously, Su Ping had decided to walk a special Beast Taming path no one had ever trodden. With the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, he could properly cultivate a group of Pet Beasts, so he never intended to sell any Pet Beast he personally raised. Now, this idea seemed to be drawing closer and closer to reality in his imagination.\nThe only slight disappointment is that if some Forest Wolves have unique skills that the other little ones haven't learned, they can't acquire them through this method. Otherwise, if Old Sha knew Wolf King Majesty, it would mean all bonded and shared Forest Wolves would also know Wolf King Majesty. And if it were like Woodhead, with skills such as Forest Concealment Technique, Armor of Wood, Wood Spike, and so on, once connected with Woodhead, wouldn't I be able to directly teach all my Forest Wolves these three skills? That would be somewhat too overpowered. Even as it is now, it's already quite exaggerated.\nFeeling this ability, besides wondering if all the regular skills of his Forest Wolf Pet Beasts could achieve a grand slam under these circumstances, another idea occurred to Su Ping.nᴇt\nCould my Heart of Woods Forest Wolf Pet Beast Breeding Base perhaps start another cultivation business? A business focusing on skill level cultivation! For essential combat skills of a Forest Wolf like Vine Strangling, if we can upgrade them from Beginner to Proficiency in a short time, charging 100,000 or 200,000 for one wouldn't be too much, would it? If it's a one-stop service, first develop the Heart of Woods skill, then cultivate it from entry-level to Proficiency, and even up to Proficient, asking for several hundred thousand or even a million would be reasonable, right? Too expensive? If you find it expensive, train them yourself! That's the price for Beast Taming and Pet Beast cultivation!\nThinking this, Su Ping's lips curled into an enthusiastic smile.",

      "content": "Chapter 20 - 20 Skill Upgrade, The Terrifying Link Effect!\n[Catalog: Forest Wolf]\n[A special Wolf Tribe proficient in the Wood Attribute, with extraordinary Life Force. Adult Forest Wolves are generally of Elite Level, skilled in Skills such as Sunlight Absorption, Vine Strangling, Self-Healing, and Accelerated Growth.]\n[Current Catalog Level: 2 (14/2000)]\nKnown Evolutionary Atlas, Special Cultivation:\n[Heart of Woods Magic Potion: Upon consuming this Magic Potion, a Forest Wolf can awaken the Skill 'Heart of Woods,' and its rank will receive a certain boost...]\nLikes, Habits:\n[Enjoys sunbathing, playing in the forest, prefers group actions, and has stronger combat capabilities in daylight or within forests.]\nRecord Logs:\n[[...]]\nThe Catalog Level needed to be raised; the next level-up required a full two thousand Experience Points. Clearly, this was not something that could be reached in just three or five days.\nGlancing at the changes in the Catalog, Su Ping's mind was hardly on this matter. He shouted directly, \"Gather!\"\nOver time, the wolf pack had become familiar with his commands. Before long, including Old Sha and Woodhead, close to thirty Forest Wolves of various sizes had gathered. Including Xiao Qing in Su Ping's arms, they were all present and accounted for.\nGiven that the Shared Connection ability was so remarkable, Su Ping naturally wanted to make good use of it. However, at present, he could only connect with fifteen wolves at a time. Clearly, these fifteen needed to be carefully selected.\nHis own Xiao Qing and Old Sha were certainly necessary. He also wanted to experiment whether Xiao Qing's Mutated Skills, Poison Vine Strangulation and Heart of the Poison Wood, could achieve a shared effect through the connection. As for the others, naturally, those with higher Talent should be chosen.\nHowever, the main Skills to be trained were not Vine Strangling or Accelerated Growth, the Forest Wolves' two main combat Skills. Instead, it was the seemingly less useful Sunlight Absorption. But in fact, this Skill was one of the main growth Skills for Forest Wolves. Its significance was extraordinary.\nSoon, Su Ping had chosen the fifteen wolves with the best Talent, including Xiao Qing, Little One, and Old Sha. The method to train the Sunlight Absorption Skill was even simpler: fifteen Forest Wolves of various sizes basking in the blazing sun together! Then, they absorbed the Light Power from the sun.\nThe Forest Wolves' Sunlight Absorption ability was very practical. It could accelerate a Forest Wolf's growth and reduce its need for food and water.\nBask in the sun to improve?\nThe fifteen connected Forest Wolves, including Old Sha, were puzzled. But they did not resist Su Ping's command in the slightest; all chose to obey.\nHowever, a Forest Wolf standing by was somewhat baffled. Woodhead watched its Forest Wolf companions lying uniformly on the grass, basking in the sun, then looked at the stern-faced Su Ping. This top-tier Forest Wolf, born with a silver spoon in its mouth, looked skeptically at Su Ping.\nCould it be that our master was really deceived by this guy? Could such a training method be effective? Could it help *me* become stronger? Was this Breeder really reliable? Although, it had to be said, living here with him was quite comfortable, happy, and satisfying.\nHowever, such skepticism lasted only two hours before suddenly, a light shone forth. It was the mutated wolf, Xiao Qing, who had leveled up! She had advanced from an ordinary Fourth Rank to an ordinary Fifth Rank. Once again, she had reached the same Level as Su Ping.\nBut that wasn't all. Not only had her Level increased, but in just that short time, the sunlight converging on Xiao Qing's body had also become even more dazzling. Under the noontime sun, she shone like a glittering emerald. She was dazzling beyond compare!\nHer Level has increased? How is that possible?\nWoodhead was green with envy.\nIn such a short time, this mutated little wolf's Sunlight Absorption reached the Proficient Level? Although it felt this Skill wasn't very useful, only adding some endurance during daylight battles, Skill improvement, especially at later stages, was transformative! So this is how Forest Wolves grow?\nAs a Forest Wolf that had reached the peak Racial Potential of its kind, Woodhead was confused. In the past, its master had trained it through battles and Magic Potions. It had never experienced this before.\nCould it be that this seemingly unreliable and weak human Beast Tamer was actually a genius?\nWoodhead's limited thinking ability and meager wisdom plunged it into doubt regarding its life as a wolf and its master, Qin Xiaoxue. However, when it looked at Su Ping, its eyes grew brighter and brighter.\nIt understood that its future was definitely not limited to being just a Forest Wolf. Not to mention, Qin Xiaoxue's second Pet Beast—which Su Ping had never seen—was naturally growing with a Racial Potential far surpassing its own. But its current foundation would greatly influence its future development. This human could really make it far stronger!\nAnd for some reason, Woodhead felt that Su Ping looked particularly agreeable today.\nIgnoring Woodhead, who was off to one side, Su Ping looked at the changing Xiao Qing with undisguisable excitement!\nIt really worked! The Skill cultivation effect of Shared Connection was like a Skill cultivation accelerator! Although progressing from the Beginner to the Proficient Level for a Skill was something most Pet Beasts could achieve through natural growth and some practice, how long had it taken Xiao Qing?! Indeed, this ability had great potential!\nSu Ping clenched his fist. Sure enough, in less than an hour, starting with Little One, several other Forest Wolves who were only at the Beginner Level of Sunlight Absorption had breakthroughs. Moreover, this breakthrough in ability was accompanied by a certain increase in their own Levels.\nIn less than half a day, under the enhancement of Shared Connection, Su Ping's wolf pack had significantly improved.\nIf he could maintain this rate of improvement, and especially as his own Realm continually increased, the more wolves that could share the connection, the easier it would be for all the Pet Beasts in his wolf pack to reach the Perfection Level in their Skills! And Su Ping believed that this day would not be too far off!\nAs he was contemplating this, the Forest Wolf Catalog provided feedback once more:\n[Discovered adult Forest Wolf, intimacy has met the requirements, Catalog Level Experience +15!]\n[This is an adult individual. For every subsequent day spent with it, Forest Wolf Catalog Experience +1!]\nSu Ping was stunned. The intimacy of his entire wolf pack had already reached the standard. With Old Sha's help, these wolves had become like his closest kin. The only one whose intimacy hadn't met the requirement was Woodhead, who was off to one side.\nSure enough, when Su Ping looked over at Woodhead, the sense of closeness that emanated from it made him smile with satisfaction.\nIndeed, even a Pet Beast contracted to someone else could meet the requirements. If that's the case, the Skill training business he had been contemplating could actually be launched!\nHowever, he had been delaying Qin Xiaoxue for so many days and had not given Woodhead the last bottle of the Heart of Woods Magic Potion.\nWasn't it all for today?\nOnce Woodhead's intimacy reached the standard, it could take the Magic Potion, which would at least slightly increase his Catalog Level Experience.\nWith that in mind, what was there to hesitate about?\nSu Ping quickly went into the room and took out the 'Heart of Woods' Magic Potion from the refrigerator. Under Woodhead's surprised and expectant gaze, he slowly opened it.",

      "content": "Chapter 21 - 21: Qin Xiaoxue Deceived? Cultivation Successful!\nBeast Master Association Headquarters.Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nIt was still the same office. Only this time, there were several more people inside.\nQin Xiaoxue, who had rushed back from the suburbs, pushed open the door. Her eyebrows quickly arched slightly as she surveyed the room. Besides her grandfather, there were two other individuals—familiar, yet she didn't know them well.\n\"Xiao Xue is back.\" Qin Erlong smiled and stood up. Qin Xiaoxue nodded, her expression indifferent and cold as she glanced at the other two people present.\nOne was a balding old man who appeared to be around the same age as Qin Erlong. The other was a man in his thirties with an eager-to-please smile. It was this man who spoke up as Qin Xiaoxue sat down, his tone respectful.\n\"Miss Qin, I am truly sorry. Regarding the incident last time, I, Sun Chaoju, representing the Wolf Den Cultivation Base, apologize to you. I've brought your cultivation fee. Furthermore, if you wouldn't mind, Wolf Den is prepared to offer Miss Qin a second, complimentary attempt at cultivating 'Accelerated Spellcasting.'\"\nQin Xiaoxue frowned slightly and looked towards Qin Erlong.\nThe old man—her grandfather—hurriedly waved his hand. \"This wasn't my idea. Old Liu heard about the incident and called Sun Chaoju over. Knowing you'd be here soon, he rushed him over.\"\nThe balding old man also smiled and said, \"Xiao Xue, this one's on me. Last time, your grandfather didn't specify who required the cultivation, and you didn't mention me or your grandfather when you visited. It's understandable that Xiao Sun might have made an oversight! But rest assured, this time I'll personally guarantee it. There definitely won't be any problems, if...\"\nCutting off the balding old man with an impatient glance, Qin Xiaoxue turned to her grandfather. \"The matter I asked you about on the phone, is there any news?\"\nThe balding old man looked embarrassed but said no more.\nQin Erlong coughed lightly. \"Correct. It's Dong Muyun, the chairman of Tianyun Group. Her background is quite formidable. Why are you asking about her?\"\nQin Xiaoxue's eyebrows knitted together, but she didn't answer her grandfather.\nThe Tianyun Group? They're influential not just in Linzhou City, but throughout Jianghai Province, even across the Dragon Nation. A personage of such status... what involvement could she have with that brat?\nThough Qin Xiaoxue often seemed unreserved, the environment she had grown up in was an undeniable factor. However, with others present, it wasn't appropriate for her to press further.\nFrowning, she looked at Sun Chaoju, who was still wearing that fawning smile, and said impatiently, \"Keep your money. It was clearly stated in the contract we signed, and I'm not short of that amount. As for continuing cultivation at your facility? Let's forget it. I've found a cultivation base to cultivate my Woodhead, so there's no need for you to trouble yourselves.\"\nThe balding old man quickly interjected with a laugh, \"Xiao Xue, are you referring to the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base on the outskirts of the city? Your grandfather mentioned it to us. Indeed, that cultivation base has been around for a long time and, in its early days, did cultivate under the banner of 'Heart of Woods.' However, over decades, only a few successful cases have emerged, and those were cubs already under contract. They have never actually succeeded in cultivating 'Heart of Woods.' Xiao Xue, don't let some charlatans deceive you!\"\nQin Xiaoxue first glared at her grandfather, then looked at the beaming, bald old man and frowned slightly. \"Do I look like someone who is easily fooled?\"\nThe old man's smile froze, his expression turning awkward again.\nQin Erlong then chimed in, \"Xiao Xue, how can you speak to your Grandpa Liu like that? Isn't Grandpa Liu just looking out for you?\"\nLooking out for me? Ultimately, it's all because of my status.\nThinking of this, Qin Xiaoxue felt a wave of revulsion. Dealing with these businesspeople and bigwigs, who treated Pet Beast cultivation purely as a business transaction and a networking opportunity, was truly tedious.\nIf she could, Qin Xiaoxue found herself actually missing the scent of wolf dung on Su Ping—pungent, yes, but somehow comforting. At least, that boy seemed to genuinely enjoy and feel passionately about Pet Beast cultivation.\nBesides, how could she not know if she was being deceived? Not to mention, seeing the several pounds Woodhead had gained over the past few days was evidence enough; she estimated that the kid must have also spent quite a bit on food costs. The contract was clear: if the cultivation failed, all the materials for 'Heart of Woods' and the cultivation fee wouldn't cost her a single cent. What could she possibly be cheated out of?\nIt was this man before her, actually. If he hadn't learned her identity, her three million cultivation fee would have been truly swindled by this scoundrel.\nHowever, she didn't feel the need to explain anything to them. After all, Su Ping hadn't finished the cultivation yet, and her Woodhead hadn't learned 'Heart of Woods,' so she naturally had no concrete proof to offer.\nBut her silence seemed to embolden the two men. Sun Chaoju quickly added, \"Yes, Miss Qin, I've looked into it as well. The previous owner of the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base left Linzhou. Now, it's just run by a young kid who recently graduated. A kid fresh out of school, what could he possibly know? He probably doesn't even understand the basics of cultivation.\"\nQin Xiaoxue's brow furrowed again. \"I also graduated only a few years ago. Mr. Sun, you seem to be underestimating people.\"\nSun Chaoju's face was a mask of fawning flattery. \"How could Miss Qin be compared to ordinary people? You're a top student from Magic Capital Academy and President Qin's granddaughter...\"\n\"Exactly, Xiao Xue,\" Old Liu interjected. \"If anyone can cultivate 'Heart of Woods' in a Forest Wolf, then, setting other considerations aside, if they have more than a thirty percent chance of success, I will personally issue them a Junior Breeder certificate. If it's over fifty percent, I'll personally grant them an Intermediate Breeder certificate. And if the success rate is even higher, then, believe me, they'll definitely be a prime candidate to represent Linzhou at the next Breeder's Conference...\"\n\"Alright, if there's nothing else, I'll be leaving first. As for the matter I asked you about on the phone, tell me when you find something out.\"\nSignaling her grandfather, Qin Xiaoxue decisively cut off the others and stood up impatiently. However, at that very moment, a clear chime sounded. It wasn't a call, but a text message notification on her phone. Few people had her private number, so anyone messaging her was undoubtedly someone she knew well. Yet, as Qin Xiaoxue pulled out her phone, she froze, a flicker of surprise on her face.\n\"What's wrong, Xiao Xue?\"\nSeeing his granddaughter suddenly stop, Qin Erlong felt a twinge of helplessness. His granddaughter excelled in every aspect—talent, intellect, and appearance were all top-tier. Her only flaw was her fiery temper and her bluntness, often disregarding others' feelings. In short, she had little interest in, or perhaps disdain for, navigating social complexities. Just like her grandmother.\nBut in response to Qin Erlong's question, Qin Xiaoxue's expression became incredibly complex and peculiar. She glanced at President Liu of the Breeder Association and Sun Chaoju from the Wolf Den Cultivation Base—who was supposedly a certified Intermediate Breeder—then said, somewhat incredulously, \"Su Ping said that Woodhead's training and cultivation are complete and successful. He asked me to come and take a look.\"\nAs soon as she spoke, silence fell upon the entire office.\n\"That's impossible!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 22 - 22 There's No Such Thing as Impossible!\n\"This is impossible!\"\nThe speaker was none other than Sun Chaoju, head of the Wolf Den base and an Intermediate Breeder personally recognized by the Breeder Association.\nHowever, as soon as the words left his mouth, he felt Qin Xiaoxue's icy stare and quickly tried to explain, \"Miss Qin, please don't misunderstand. It's just that, how could a student who has just graduated possibly...\"\n\"Why couldn't it be possible?\"\nIt seemed that after receiving a text message, Qin Xiaoxue, who had been slightly anxious, relaxed a great deal. She huffed, \"In the Dragon Nation, the current Master of the Divine Dragon was also nineteen when he discovered the special evolutionary path of the Yellow Scaled Snake, leading to the True Dragon Blessing we have today!\"\nSun Chaoju opened his mouth but couldn't find anything else to say.\nIf she's comparing this unknown kid with the Legendary Divine Dragon, what more is there to say?\nThe bald President Liu asked doubtfully, \"Xiao Xue, within the soul connection, haven't you felt anything abnormal with your Pet Beast?\"\nLooking at the three people before her—even her own grandfather—all wearing expressions of disbelief, Qin Xiaoxue grew impatient. She had no intention of wasting time bickering with these old men; she just wanted to see how much her beloved Pet Beast, Woodhead, had improved in strength after mastering the Heart of Woods.\n\"If you don't believe it, just come with me and see for yourself.\" The three people present had clearly been waiting for exactly this.\nTaking the Beast Master Association's flyer, it only took twenty minutes to travel from the Linzhou City Center directly to the suburbs.\nLooking over the Lingxi River territory, Qin Erlong nodded. \"Say what you will, the environment is still quite nice. It seems that recent development here has been good.\"The most update n0vels are published on Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\nQin Xiaoxue wasn't in the mood to listen to her grandfather's work guidance. She quickly walked to the gate and rang the doorbell, calling out as she did, \"Su Ping! Hurry up and open the door, I'm here!\"\nNo sooner had her words fallen than the gate opened.\nSu Ping's voice came from the intercom, \"Come in. It's in the guest room!\"\nQin Erlong and President Liu said nothing, following behind their granddaughter, who seemed almost ready to take flight.\nOnly Sun Chaoju looked around disdainfully.\nThe place is indeed not small, but can this Cultivation base even be called a Cultivation base? It's a bit too shabby, isn't it?\nHe still couldn't believe that an unknown nobody could cultivate a Forest Wolf with a rare Skill like the Heart of Woods. Having studied the Cultivation of Forest Wolves for many years, Sun Chaoju understood all too well what this Skill meant for a Forest Wolf!\nAt this thought, Sun Chaoju's spirits lifted, ready for action.\nJust now, Qin Xiaoxue showed me no respect at all, and she even used this unknown whippersnapper as an example, comparing him to the Master of the Divine Dragon? Wait until I expose this kid's deception.\nSun Chaoju prided himself on his research on the Forest Wolf; in Linzhou City, he believed few could compare. He not only possessed a secret technique to cultivate the Rapid Casting Skill in Forest Wolves but could also increase their Racial Skill learning speed. He had even set a record for the fastest improvement: a Forest Wolf's Sunlight Absorption Skill upgraded from Beginner to Proficiency in just half a month.\nIt was precisely because of such secret techniques that the Wolf Den had gained a certain reputation in Jianghai Province.\nHe previously had no idea that Miss Qin had visited their Wolf Den in disguise for Cultivation. Otherwise, wouldn't he have worshipped her like an ancestor? However, it seems a bit late now to start cozying up to her. Since that's the case, I can only make Miss Qin realize that our Wolf Den is the best Forest Wolf Cultivation base in all of Linzhou! I have to make Miss Qin believe in our Wolf Den again. But what method did this kid use to deceive people? Does he have some kind of simulation Ability, allowing other Pet Beasts to temporarily possess a certain Skill, like the Mirror Heaven Reflection Talent among Beast Tamers? That could achieve a similar effect. Or perhaps some forbidden method was used, like overdrawing the Forest Wolf's Life Force and then forcing it to master the Heart of Woods through training. All these are possibilities.\nFinally, under Sun Chaoju's eager anticipation, the four of them pushed open the main doors. As soon as they stepped inside, not just the others, but Qin Xiaoxue too couldn't help but widen her eyes in amazement.\nWhat am I seeing? Nobody understands Woodhead's character better than I do. Or rather, most Pet Beasts from the Wolf Tribe are like that: proud and aloof, looking down on everyone except their master and their own kind. Even Breeders, in Woodhead's eyes, are just servants there to serve it. But now... Woodhead is like the most obedient pug, squatting on the ground, affectionately licking Su Ping's outstretched palm! That's right! Am I seeing things? Is that... sycophancy... from my Woodhead?\n\"You're here... Huh? Who are these people?\" Su Ping asked, wiping his damp palm on Woodhead's temple fur before turning to see Qin Xiaoxue and the others who had entered.\nQin Xiaoxue clearly had no intention of introducing them to Su Ping; her eyes glowed as she stared at Woodhead. During the past few days of Cultivation, to ensure Woodhead's intimacy with Su Ping reached the required level, Su Ping had strictly limited Qin Xiaoxue's contact with her Pet Beast, as its owner. She had missed Woodhead terribly.\nNow, she threw her arms around Woodhead's neck and nuzzled it.\n\"AWOO!\" Woodhead also let out an excited howl.\nMeeting Su Ping's inquiring gaze, Qin Erlong coughed lightly. \"Hello, Student Su. I am this girl's grandfather. I heard you were cultivating my granddaughter's Pet Beast? I didn't expect Linzhou to have such a young and promising Breeder, so I came to take a look.\"\nSu Ping was startled, then quickly nodded.\nThat's more like it! No matter how rich the family is, it's normal for them to come and confirm the spending of several million on Cultivation fees.\nRealizing he was dealing with the financiers, Su Ping's face instantly wreathed in smiles as he nodded again.\nHowever, Su Ping's gaze soon shifted to another person present, his expression somewhat strange.\nFollowing Su Ping's gaze, Qin Erlong couldn't help but turn his head. Sure enough, the other two beside him were staring intently at the sole massive Forest Wolf in the room. Sun Chaoju, in particular, had streaks of data flickering in his pupils; clearly, his Talent as a Beast Tamer was one of the more common ones: the Eye of Truth.\nAnd at that moment, reflected in the eyes of the Wolf Den's head, an Intermediate Breeder, the huge words 'Heart of Woods (Beginner)' emanating from Woodhead were blindingly bright.\nWas the Cultivation really successful?\n\"How is this possible!?\"\nThis time, the exclamation, even louder than Sun Chaoju's earlier one, came not from the Intermediate Breeder but from Vice President Liu of the Breeder Association, who was staring fixedly at Woodhead.",

      "content": "Chapter 23 - 23: Su Ping, Genius Breeder!\nSu Ping looked at the two with a skeptical expression.\nIn his heart, he was actually somewhat apprehensive, understanding the significance of the Heart of Woods skill. The saying 'possessing a treasure invites trouble' could very well be true. Although the Dragon Nation took this matter very seriously, it might still not withstand those who harbored ill intentions. If he weren't truly in need of money, he wouldn't have wanted to stand out this much. However, he had long thought of a way to deal with this, and this skeptical and disdainful look was part of his plan.\n\"What's so impossible?\"\nHearing Su Ping's words and seeing the young man's disdainful look, which seemed to say 'country bumpkin who hasn't seen the world,' Vice President Liu could only force a dry laugh before speaking, \"Student Su, did you cultivate this Forest Wolf yourself?\"\nSu Ping frowned instantly, put on a disdainful look as if unwilling to answer, and directly turned to Qin Xiaoxue. \"Who are all these people?\"\nQin Xiaoxue had already sensed the progress and changes in Woodhead through the Soul Contract, and at this moment, she completely believed in Su Ping's abilities.\nThis kid was actually a Genius Breeder! However, it seemed that this Genius Breeder was not in a very good mood at the moment.\nQin Xiaoxue frowned and also turned to look at Sun Chaoju and Vice President Liu.\nThese two guys had swindled her out of millions previously and had been constantly questioning her ability to recognize talent! Now that they were here, they started asking all sorts of questions again. In the end, weren't they just incompetent and envious of the capable? No wonder the Breeder Association in Jianghai Province hadn't achieved any significant results over the years, causing Jianghai Province to lose face in this aspect throughout the Dragon Nation. This bunch of good-for-nothings bore undeniable responsibility!\nStill, since it involved the old man, it wouldn't be good for her to drive them away directly, so she could only snort softly.\nHowever, having witnessed this scene, both Qin Erlong and Vice President Liu were completely convinced.\nDid this young man truly cultivate it by himself?! Geniuses, after all, tend to have a degree of pride and distinct personalities.\nThe value of a Genius Breeder is, many times, even more crucial than that of a genius Beast Tamer. After all, a genius Beast Tamer might only affect their own combat power, but a Genius Breeder could potentially cultivate many top-tier Pet Beasts and Beast Tamers. The importance was clear to all.For a moment, even Vice President Liu, who had not been very convinced before, started looking at Su Ping differently. At this moment, there was only one person among those present who still had the same demeanor.\nIt was none other than Sun Chaoju. His eyes were still bloodshot as he stared at the huge Forest Wolf, Woodhead,\ntrying to figure out how Su Ping had managed it by relying on his own understanding of Forest Wolves, just by observing Woodhead.\nHowever, from its external appearance and the feedback from his Eye of Truth, he could not see how. Thus, a thought unconsciously crossed his mind.Follow current novels on ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nIn an instant, a flash of white light shone throughout the guest room. Everyone's gaze suddenly fixed on it. The reason was simple: that flash of white light was the glow of summoning a Pet Beast. And what appeared before their eyes was a huge azure python. In its triangular eyes, there was nothing but cold indifference.\nCommander-level Pet Beast: Cloud-Patterned Tree Python!\nAt once, the atmosphere in the guest room turned icy cold. However, the one who felt even colder was not Su Ping, not Qin Xiaoxue, but Sun Chaoju himself. He felt as if needles were pricking all over his body, causing him to shiver involuntarily. Soon after, he saw Qin Erlong and Vice President Liu looking at him with rather unkind expressions.\nIndeed, Vice President Liu took good care of him. After all, Sun Chaoju had once worked under him as a researcher, nominally sharing a master-disciple relationship, and had shown his respect with gifts every year. But at this moment, Su Ping's talent had won his approval.\nIf this truly were a rare Genius Breeder, cultivating him properly could mean that, for the next few decades, he might represent Linzhou City, or even Jianghai Province, at the Breeder Conference. This would be a tremendous benefit. It was widely known that both the Beast Master Association and the Breeder Association allocated resources based on achievements or, one might say, political performance in this field. Therefore, if someone wanted to snuff out a genius over the cultivation method of the Heart of Woods, others aside, Qin Erlong and Vice President Liu would be the first to stand up and strike down such an attempt with thunderous fury! This was why, over the years, the Dragon Nation had seen a continual emergence of talent. This was also why Su Ping dared to use his cultivation abilities to make money, as a replacement for the Heart of Woods Magic Potions, after the situation had eased slightly. The official attitude towards geniuses, unless in exceptional circumstances, never involved suppression.\nSun Chaoju snapped back to reality under the sharp gazes of the two elders and hurriedly, almost subconsciously, explained, \"President, Teacher, I just wanted to test if Miss Qin's Pet Beast's life potential and combat capabilities were affected. This was to prevent her from being deceived by this kid and the Pet Beast being left with some irreparable underlying issues. That would be terrible.\"\nThe bald Vice President Liu said indifferently, \"Breeder Sun, if there were anything wrong, wouldn't I be able to see it? Or are you suggesting that your abilities have surpassed both mine and Old Qin's?\"\nSun Chaoju's body stiffened, and he quickly withdrew his Cloud-Patterned Tree Python. Su Ping licked his lips subconsciously.\nHe had no interest in or concern for this person who had jumped out. All his attention at this moment was focused on the title Sun Chaoju had used, specifically the two words: 'President?' In this world, in the current Dragon Nation, only a few individuals could be addressed as 'President'! And any of those individuals represented a level that Su Ping found difficult to interact with at his current stage.\nSu Ping glanced at Qin Xiaoxue.\nHe regretted it again. Showing off is detrimental! It's too detrimental! Why did I have to show off before? Why did I reject the conditions promised by that top wealthy lady? However, I need to manage my expression! I've recently presented myself to Qin Xiaoxue as a Breeder who takes great pleasure in Pet Beasts. And in front of these people, I've maintained the proud attitude of a genius. I can't go back to the wealthy lady to renegotiate now.\nThough he felt surprise and regret internally, Su Ping's face remained extremely calm, as if he were indifferent to everything that had just happened. Once the situation calmed down, he said faintly, \"Are you finished? My job here is done. If you need anything else, you can say so now. If not, you can pay.\"\nLooking at the POS machine Su Ping brought out, Qin Xiaoxue nodded and promptly took out her card, swiping it. The next moment, Su Ping received a notification on his phone:\n[Your account has received 5,000,000 yuan. The payment was verified as an operating expense, and tax amounting to 550,000 yuan was deducted, resulting in an actual credit of 4,450,000 yuan. Your current account balance is: 4,451,562 yuan.]\nFinally, I have money!\nSu Ping was thrilled, but soon he hesitated. \"Miss Qin, you've overpaid.\"\nQin Xiaoxue was unconcerned about such a minor detail. \"Just call me by my name, or Sister Qin is fine. Typing 350 requires changing the keypad three times; this is more convenient. Besides, you have material costs too! Relax~\"\nLooking at this reasoning, so financially extravagant it left Su Ping speechless, what else could he say? Meanwhile, Sun Chaoju, who was standing to the side, saw Qin Xiaoxue finally smile and hurriedly tried to make amends for his earlier actions: \"Su Xiao is truly formidable. However, Miss Qin, although the cultivation for its skills is complete, I've observed that your Forest Wolf's skill levels seem somewhat low. To be frank, our Wolf Den Pet Beast Breeding Base only includes 'Accelerated Spellcasting' incidentally. Our main service is helping Pet Beasts quickly enhance their Skill Proficiency Levels. To strengthen your Pet Beast's combat capabilities, if Miss Qin isn't in a hurry, you could come to our Wolf Den to enhance its skill levels.\"\nQin Xiaoxue was indeed taken aback by these words.\nTrue, although she had meticulously cultivated her Woodhead, focusing primarily on combat, because it had learned so many skills, its skill levels had improved relatively slowly. This was indeed an aspect Qin Xiaoxue cared about.\nPerceiving Qin Xiaoxue's interest, Sun Chaoju quickly continued, \"You can rest assured, Miss Qin. I have absolute confidence in this area. Even if I can't guarantee an improvement in its Skill Proficiency Level within these few months, the progress will definitely be much faster! And please don't worry; consider it compensation for last time. This time, it's all free!\"\nQin Xiaoxue pondered for a moment, then instead of addressing Sun Chaoju, she turned to Su Ping. \"Does your Heart of Woods offer this cultivation service?\"\nSu Ping smiled and then nodded. As Sun Chaoju's eyes bulged, Su Ping spoke slowly, \"We do offer them, but it's not free, and it's actually quite expensive!\"\nAt that, Sun Chaoju, whose complexion had just started to improve slightly, immediately darkened again.",

      "content": "Chapter 24 - 24 Another Bet? Crazy Bet!\nIs this kid deliberately opposing me? Why is he so annoying at every turn?\nSun Chaoju's face looked somewhat displeased.\nHowever, since Qin Xiaoxue had asked personally, it couldn't be considered Su Ping stealing business. Moreover, if anyone was to be accused of stealing business, it should be Sun Chaoju.\nYet, before Sun Chaoju could ponder further, Qin Xiaoxue had already nodded directly, \"No problem, name your price!\"\nSu Ping did not hold back. He was indeed in dire need of money right now. Apart from cultivating the current Forest Wolf pack, he also had to train his own Xiao Qing.\nXiao Qing, unlike other Forest Wolves, required rare Poison Type resources.\nMoreover, he needed to continue expanding the scale of his Pet Beast Breeding Base, all of which entailed considerable expenses.\n\"Let me make it clear,\" Su Ping began after receiving Qin Xiaoxue's affirmative answer, \"I will only be responsible for cultivating the Racial Skills of the Forest Wolves, as well as the Wood Heart Skill I personally cultivated. I won't take care of other skills!\"\nHe then stated his terms, \"To advance a skill from Beginner to Proficient Level, it's 200,000 for each Racial Skill. To advance from Proficient Level to Proficient, it's 800,000 per attempt. As for reaching Perfection Level, I haven't decided yet. It also depends on the specific skill.\"\nUpon hearing this, everyone was slightly startled.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\nEven the bald old man, who had been silent until now, paused and said, \"Young Su, this isn't how skill level cultivation fees are calculated. It should be based on time. After all, Pet Beasts have varying aptitudes. If you charge by level of cultivation...\"\nHe didn't finish his sentence. If charged by level, and the skill never materialized, would the Beast Tamer keep their Pet Beast indefinitely at your cultivation base? Clearly, this was impossible.\nAnd Sun Chaoju, seemingly having found a weak point, said, \"Young Brother Su must not have undertaken this kind of cultivation before. But that's normal. Achieving what you have is already quite impressive. You have a bright future ahead. However, everyone has their own specialty, and it seems there's still much for you to learn in this area!\"\nSu Ping snorted lightly, \"This senior shouldn't compare me to those mediocre Breeders. If I say I can do it, I most certainly can! Unless this senior would like to put it to the test?!\"\nVice President Liu frowned slightly, but Sun Chaoju, on the other hand, seemed to be instantly energized. \"Oh? I won't speak of anything else, but I, Sun Chaoju, do have some insights into the cultivation of Forest Wolf skill levels. Currently, most of Woodhead's skills have reached the Proficient Level, with only Self-Healing still at the Beginner Level! If Miss Qin trusts me, I am confident I can elevate Woodhead's Self-Healing to Proficient Level within a month! Are you challenging me to a bet, young brother?\"\nAs he spoke, a confident look truly appeared on his face.\nHowever, the others were a different matter. If Sun Chaoju had looked at Woodhead at that moment—standing to the side, being petted by its master—he would have seen in the Forest Wolf's eyes a gaze that seemed to view him as a fool.\nA month? From Beginner to Proficient Level?\nThe problem was, just this morning, Woodhead had seen with its own eyes that little Forest Wolf elevate its Sunlight Absorption—a Forest Wolf Racial Skill—to the Proficient Level in just two hours! Although the initial progress of Sunlight Absorption might be relatively simple compared to Self-Healing, the difference was still significant!\nSu Ping smiled too. He truly loved betting. The previous bet with Qin Xiaoxue had ended with him forgoing a large portion of the rewards due to his swagger. But now, with an offer landing right at his doorstep, why not grab it?\nBesides, this was the result Su Ping had intentionally guided things towards! He had just heard this guy claim his base had a cultivation method for 'Accelerated Spellcasting.' Accelerated Casting, as the name implies, speeds up the casting time of skills and is considered a quite practical skill.\nWith the Shared Connection, Su Ping didn't need to worry about having too many skills causing the Forest Wolf's skill levels to be too low. Naturally, forming complete effect combinations with skills couldn't be better!\nAnd he could guess that the man before him probably had a greedy eye on his Wood Heart Skill!\nThinking of this, Su Ping's mind stirred, but a disdainful smirk touched the corner of his mouth. \"One month? Don't even mention a month. If I can't get the Self-Healing skill to Proficient Level within half a month, then I'll consider it my loss!\"\nA greedy light flickered in Sun Chaoju's eyes. Without waiting for others to speak, and just as Su Ping began, he responded decisively, \"Good! If Brother Su is so confident, then let it be half a month. How about this: if Brother Su can't do it within half a month, we'll make the cultivation method of the Wood Heart Skill the stake. What do you say?\"\nAs soon as these words came out, Su Ping sneered inwardly, his face remaining calm. Even Qin Xiaoxue, Qin Erlong, and Vice President Liu furrowed their brows.\nThis Sun Chaoju's behavior is quite unseemly, isn't it?\nSeeming to sense the displeasure in their eyes, Sun Chaoju hurriedly added, \"Of course, if you can do it, I'm willing to accept the loss! If Brother Su has any demands, just say the word!\"\nSu Ping's expression remained unchanged. \"Alright, this half-month, if I haven't raised Self-Healing to Proficient Level, it's my loss! The question is, what can you put up? Could it possibly be the cultivation method of that 'Accelerated Spellcasting' the senior just mentioned? Never mind how much value your cultivation method has; even if it has some, it's far from comparable to the Wood Heart Skill, right?\"\nIf it were any other Forest Wolf, Su Ping wouldn't dare make such a boast, but Woodhead was different. At this very moment, Woodhead's bond with him had reached the required standard. They could now share skill experience through the Forest Wolf Catalog. Increasing its level wouldn't be difficult at all.\nUpon hearing these words, Qin Xiaoxue glanced at Su Ping. In this moment, he looked exactly as he had a few days earlier when he stopped her in this guest room.\nSomething stirred in Qin Xiaoxue's mind, as if she understood something, and she followed with a cold snort, \"Exactly. I've already experienced what that 'Accelerated Spellcasting' of yours is. Besides, you can only get one Beginner Level skill to the next level in a month, while Su Ping has chosen to do it in half a month. The difficulty is clearly not on the same level. Such an unequal contest and bet might as well not happen.\"\nVice President Liu nodded in agreement.\nHowever, Sun Chaoju's eyes narrowed, his mind racing. Although he was a bit uncertain, a thought emerged—\nIs this young man bluffing with this kind of reasoning and method, merely seeking a way out!?\nYet, thinking of the Wood Heart Skill cultivation method, greed flashed in Sun Chaoju's eyes.\nThe Wood Heart Skill! What massive benefits could he rake in if he controlled the cultivation method that could grant this Ability to the Forest Wolf?\nWith this in mind, Sun Chaoju gritted his teeth, determined to make this youngster agree.\nThus, before everyone's gaze, Sun Chaoju plainly said, \"In addition to the cultivation method for Accelerated Casting, I have another stake! It is the incomplete cultivation method for Evolution into the Wanmu Wolf!\"\nIn an instant, it wasn't just the others; even Su Ping could only think one thing:\nHas this guy lost his mind?",

      "content": "Chapter 25: Chapter 25: Forest Wolf’s Evolution: Wanmu Wolf!\nIn the world of Beast Tamers, what is the most precious and valuable thing? Pet Beasts and everything related to them. If one were to discuss what holds the highest value, the evolutionary path of cultivation would undoubtedly be among them.\nApart from some high-level Pet Beast Races that possess great innate Racial Potential, for anyone walking the path of a professional Beast Tamer, Evolution is a necessity. The Forest Wolf is undoubtedly one such Pet Beast.\nHowever, obtaining the methods of Evolution is actually very difficult for ordinary people. Even though some evolutionary methods are public, the resources required are extremely difficult to obtain.\nOfficials indeed encourage Beast Tamers to explore discovered evolutionary channels and Cultivation methods, but people often have selfish interests. However, such cases are a minority. After all, discovering a Pet Beast’s evolutionary path is not something an ordinary Breeder can achieve. The development of a new evolutionary Cultivation path often requires a large number of experiments and a frightening amount of financial support.\nEvolutionary paths are so precious, and at this moment, Sun Chaoju actually proposed such a gamble. Feeling everyone’s surprised attention, Sun Chaoju also felt a bit smug as he looked towards Su Ping.\nHowever, people quickly came to their senses, and this time, Qin Erlong finally spoke:\n\"To what degree is it incomplete? And what type of Evolutionary Body is the Wanmu Wolf?\"\nThis person indeed had broad knowledge and immediately pinpointed the key issue.\nAs expected, when directly asked about the issue, Sun Chaoju scratched his head:\n\"It’s a pure Wood Element Evolutionary Body of the Wolf Tribe. As for its other Abilities... I only accidentally achieved Evolution once. After that Evolution, the Wanmu Wolf died three days later. Despite many subsequent attempts, I only succeeded one more time, but it also died after just two days.\"\nSuddenly, everyone present understood. Qin Xiaoxue, standing to the side, snorted disdainfully:\n\"This counts as an incomplete evolutionary path? It’s clearly just a research direction.\"\nSun Chaoju felt helpless. If this thing were truly so precious, he wouldn’t have offered it as a bet. Over this period, all the funds the Wolf Den had saved up for years had been poured into this without yielding any clear results. Even if not used as a bet, Sun Chaoju wanted to sell it or let his teacher’s Breeder Association collaborate on the research.\nQin Erlong and Vice President Liu didn’t show much reaction. The latter asked:ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\n\"Why did it die?\"\nSun Chaoju, after all, was an Intermediate Level Breeder, not someone who only talked without substance. He quickly said:\n\"Teacher, as you know, the Wood Element Attribute is relatively special. Most plants belong to this Attribute, and very few animal-class Pet Beasts possess it. The reason is that although the Wood Element has compatibility with the Life Series, awakening it is extremely difficult. Moreover, most Life Series creatures are primarily healing-type Pet Beasts, which doesn’t fit the expectations the majority of people have for the Forest Wolf. Most evolutionary forms of the Forest Wolf aim to suppress the Wood Element’s progression towards the Life Series or attempt to derive other Attributes. The Wanmu Wolf, however, goes a step further by significantly strengthening the Wood Element! This enhances its Wood Element Abilities, but when these Abilities intensify, the evolved Wanmu Wolf’s body undergoes fibrosis, its organs suffer severe failure, and it dies, transforming into a withered plant-like body.\"\nWith these words, Vice President Liu nodded as well, falling into thought. Then, he finally turned to Su Ping:\n\"Su Ping, you’ve heard it. Although this is an incomplete method of Evolution, the defects are very apparent. The method of Cultivation and Evolution is probably difficult, if not impossible. You need to consider this carefully.\"\nWhat more was there for Su Ping to consider? In truth, during this brief period, he hadn’t really heard what these individuals were saying; all his attention and Spirit were on the Wanmu Wolf. Defects? An incomplete evolutionary method? To others, these might be critically important, perhaps even rendering the method valueless. But for Su Ping, with his Forest Wolf Catalog, he could even analyze the reasons behind Xiao Qing’s mutated Poison Type bloodline, let alone an already proposed evolutionary method! As long as the Forest Wolf Catalog contained sufficient experience, Su Ping was absolutely confident that the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas could complete the Wanmu Wolf’s evolutionary path!\nEvolution! This is indeed the most exhilarating step in Pet Beast Cultivation.\nHowever, facing everyone’s probing gazes, Su Ping pretended to ponder for a while before nodding:\n\"I can try. Perhaps I could perfect the Wanmu Wolf’s Evolution method!\"\nHis face showed the unique confidence of a young Beast Tamer, radiant as the rising Sun in the early morning. He seemed entirely unconcerned about the possibility of losing the bet; instead, his focus was already on cultivating the Forest Wolf’s Evolutionary Body: the Wanmu Wolf.\nSuch confidence made the few onlookers sigh, and Vice President Liu even candidly laughed:\n\"Hahaha, young Su, if you can achieve this, never mind anything else! If you qualify as a Senior Breeder, I’ll personally handle your application. And if, one day, you wish to take the Master Breeder proficiency certification, I’ll vouch for you and contact the examiners at the Breeder Association headquarters!\"\nPerfecting and developing a new evolutionary path is the mark of a Senior Breeder. In all of Jianghai Province, there are very few Senior Breeders! One can imagine the weight of his promise.\nHowever, Qin Xiaoxue clearly wasn’t buying it, snorting dismissively:\n\"Didn’t someone just say that if Su Ping could cultivate the Heart of Woods, he would be given Intermediate Breeder certification?\"\nSu Ping was taken aback. The balding Vice President Liu, looking somewhat embarrassed, touched his nose and quickly said:\n\"Young Su, what do you reckon your chances are of cultivating the Heart of Woods?\"\nSu Ping, seeing everyone’s eyes turning to him with tension, felt somewhat reassured. He thought this was a chance to reveal some of his Abilities. After considering, he said:\n\"Probably about sixty to seventy percent.\"\nThe moment these words were spoken, the others might not have reacted much, but Sun Chaoju’s breath once again grew rapid. No one would doubt Su Ping; the best proof was right beside them! A sixty to seventy percent chance of success in Cultivation was more than enough.\nVice President Liu made a decisive comment:\n\"Young Su, there are still procedures to follow, but don’t worry. Since it was I, Old Liu, who personally made a promise in front of Miss Qin, I certainly won’t renege on it. Give me your personal information later. Once I’ve handled the procedures, I’ll personally deliver the certificate to you tomorrow! Then, you’ll be an Intermediate Breeder registered with the Breeder Association!\"\nThe certification for a Breeder is much simpler than for a Beast Tamer, yet there are far fewer certified Breeders. Su Ping had no intention of refusing. During the days Qin Xiaoxue was absent, he had learned how challenging breeding work could be without fame or official endorsement.\nAnything that could make money for himself was a good thing!\nHowever, compared to these matters, all of Su Ping’s thoughts were now tied up with the Forest Wolf’s Evolutionary Body. He nodded, exchanged a few more words of pleasantries with them, officially confirmed the bet, and then saw them off.",

      "content": "Chapter 26: Chapter 26: Ancient Spirit-Nurturing Tea! Forest of Myriad Forms Meditation Method!\nThe scent of tea lingered.\nAt this moment, in the reception room, only Qin Xiaoxue and Su Ping remained.\nAfter the previous three people left, Woodhead, excited to be allowed to stay at Heart of Woods, had already run out to play.\nAs Su Ping inhaled the tea’s fragrance, he wondered if it was his imagination, but his mind felt many times clearer than usual. Even the circulation of his spiritual power seemed brisker.\nThis tea is extraordinary!\nSu Ping affirmed internally as he gazed at the brewed tea.\nAlthough, after realizing the young lady’s identity, it seemed normal for her to casually produce such a thing.\nHowever, Su Ping hadn’t asked Qin Xiaoxue about the identities of the individuals from earlier. He understood the art of currying favor with the wealthy.\nHaving missed the previous chance, he was quite content with the current situation.\nIt was Qin Xiaoxue who asked somewhat nervously, \"Su Ping, are you confident?\"\nSu Ping waved his hand. \"Don’t worry, what’s this tea? Just wait and see, Sister Qin. Providing Woodhead with Accelerated Casting for his cultivation will be a piece of cake.\"\nSu Ping himself wasn’t concerned, so Qin Xiaoxue breathed a sigh of relief. If possible, she certainly hoped for Su Ping to win. \"It’s good you’re confident, but Accelerated Casting won’t be necessary; having Heart of Woods is enough. As for this tea, my grandfather got it from a Spirit-Nourishing Ancient Tea Tree. After brewing, it enhances meditation effects and the speed of learning the Meditation Method. It’s even beneficial for future cultivation, so drink more! If it’s not enough, I have more.\"\nEnhancing meditation effects and the speed of cultivation?\nSu Ping’s eyebrows raised sharply. \"Meditation Method? What’s that?\"\nHe, of course, knew what meditation was, but this was the first time he’d heard of a Meditation Method.\nQin Xiaoxue blinked. \"The Meditation Method is a special meditation technique that greatly enhances the effectiveness of meditation. It also makes it more convenient for Beast Tamers to control their Pet Beasts to some extent. However, it’s normal for you not to have access to it. Genuine Meditation Methods are seldom circulated in the market. Only Advanced Tamer Academies, the Beast Master Association, and some major powers or inherited families possess them. And even if you come across one, it’s hard to cultivate. The reason is simple: to practice the Meditation Method, a Beast Tamer may even require a specific kind of Pet Beast to assist! Without exposure from a young age, few Beast Tamers meet the requirements.\"\nAt this point, Qin Xiaoxue lowered her voice slightly. \"For example, the Forest of Myriad Forms Meditation Method that I practice is one such method. It’s also one from the collection of the Magic Capital Advanced Beast-Taming Academy.\"\nThe Forest of Myriad Forms Meditation Method? The Magic Capital Advanced Beast-Taming Academy?\nSu Ping’s mind stirred.Follow current novels on ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\nHalf a month ago, he wouldn’t have even known such things existed, let alone come into contact with them.\nSeeing Su Ping deep in thought, Qin Xiaoxue smiled slightly. \"Of course, don’t think too much. Although the Meditation Method is precious, in reality, the foundation of a Beast Tamer mainly lies in their Pet Beasts. Some with good spiritual Talent don’t need the Meditation Method to improve rapidly and can control stronger Pet Beasts. Moreover, with your Talent, these opportunities are not out of reach in the future. However, if you do wish to join the Magic Capital Advanced Beast-Taming Academy and have a chance to practice advanced Meditation Methods from the academy...\"\nAt this point, Qin Xiaoxue lowered her voice. \"Remember, when choosing your second Pet Beast, either pick a Plant Type or an Undead Type. As for specific Pet Beasts, I’ll compile a list and send it to you for consideration. Remember not to tell anyone!\"\nIs this exclusive information?\nSu Ping was taken aback.\nBut... joining the Magic Capital Advanced Beast-Taming Academy?\nSu Ping hadn’t really considered it. With the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas and the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base, he felt he didn’t need anything else.\nThat can wait until later.\nAs for the second Pet Beast, Su Ping had indeed considered a few. In his view, the most important aspect was not high Racial Potential. On the contrary, a species that was common and numerous would be even better.\nSeeing Su Ping’s demeanor, Qin Xiaoxue did not say more on this topic.\nPicking up the teacup, Su Ping took a sip. He felt a warm yet refreshing sensation that made his entire brain incredibly clear and extremely comfortable.\n「Meanwhile, on the other side, after Qin Erlong and his two companions left, they split into two groups.」\nQin Erlong returned to the Beast Master Association, while Sun Chaoju and his teacher, Vice President Liu, went to the Breeder Association.\nIn Sun Chaoju’s car, he glanced at Vice President Liu, who was resting with his eyes closed, and then asked, \"Teacher, what do you think of that Su Ping?\"\nVice President Liu slowly opened his eyes, gave his student a sidelong look, and said coldly, \"I know what little scheme you’re up to. Since Su Ping agreed to the bet, let it be. But as for other tactics, keep them all above board. Even if you lose, honor the bet and accept your loss. If you win, you are to deliver the Accelerated Casting cultivation method to Su Ping as well.\"\nAt these words, Sun Chaoju was startled. \"Teacher, I...\"\nBefore he could finish speaking, Vice President Liu interrupted. \"It’s only because you’re my student that I’m willing to say this much. Since Su Ping has managed to gain Miss Qin’s attention, and even her friendship, he has great potential. Besides, making friends with a highly talented Breeder is a good thing. We are all from Jianghai Province, so don’t be so narrow-minded. If that kid really manages to develop the evolution method for the Wanmu Wolf and enters the Breeder Competition, then as the initial discoverer, even if you’re not the primary research Breeder, your name will still be mentioned.\"\nUpon hearing this, Sun Chaoju’s eyes lit up, but he quickly looked at the elder with surprise. \"Teacher, do you really think that Su Ping could accomplish such a feat?\"\n\"Who knows? But I do know that it’s much better to befriend a talented young person than to make an enemy. We live in a society governed by law now. Why can’t things be settled amicably?\"\nListening to his teacher’s life experience, Sun Chaoju nodded, but he still said with some doubt, \"Teacher, after all, even though President Qin is only half a level higher than you, you don’t need to be so deferential towards Miss Qin...\"\nHow exactly Sun Chaoju thought he was being deferential towards Miss Qin, he didn’t say, but Vice President Liu understood his meaning. He just looked at his student, then sighed and shook his head. \"You don’t understand.\"\nSun Chaoju didn’t know what he didn’t understand, but he didn’t press further. He knew that even if he asked, his teacher wouldn’t tell him.\nDealing with cryptic people is frustrating, but one must always consider who they are.\n「At this moment, Qin Erlong, having returned to his office, began to contemplate.」\nIt was the first time he had seen his granddaughter place such trust in a stranger of the opposite sex.\nThis sparked a peculiar thought in Qin Erlong’s mind.\nCould it be possible that my granddaughter has taken a liking to Su Ping?\nThe thought made Qin Erlong involuntarily gasp.\nIf that’s the case, then that would be... excellent! Come to think of it, this Su Ping fellow might be a tad arrogant, but for someone his age, such achievements and youthful spirit are to be expected. Plus, with his aptitude, even if his Beast Taming Talent is a bit lacking, it’s not a major issue. His looks are even comparable to mine when I was young! And though his family background is ordinary, if my granddaughter likes him, none of that matters.\nThinking of this, Qin Erlong also became enthusiastic. He was incredibly eager to marry off his granddaughter to a good family soon, saving his old bones the trouble she caused. That damn Magic Capital Advanced Beast-Taming Academy, insisting on a summer break just so this little troublemaker could come and torment an old man like me! Now that she might have a new target for her antics, Qin Erlong was thrilled.\nWith that thought, the elder took out his phone and dialed a special number.\nAfter three rings, a voice on the other end answered the call. \"It’s rare for you, Qin Erlong, to call me at this time. Has something happened to Xiao Xue?\"\n\"Wife, our Xiao Xue might be in love!\"\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"A youngster, just graduated from a basic Beast Taming school, cultivated a rare Heart of Woods for our girl. Now they’re getting along splendidly!\"\n\"Hmm? Heart of Woods? That’s interesting. Tell me more about it.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 27: Chapter 27: Ordinary Seventh Rank, The Arrival of the Gathering!\nThe effects of the Spirit-Nurturing Ancient Tea really didn’t deceive him.\nSu Ping only felt an unprecedented boiling and excitement in his spiritual power.\nThe smoothness of the meditation took Su Ping by surprise.\nJust a few days ago, he had just broken through to the average Fifth Rank.\nHowever, after repeatedly brewing that small pot of Spirit-Nurturing Ancient Tea several times, Su Ping found that his Spiritual Realm had directly broken through to another level.\nHe had reached the average Sixth Rank.\nEven more so, this was just the beginning!\nAs Qin Xiaoxue had said, the effect of the Spirit-Nurturing Ancient Tea was to enhance meditation. After breaking through and beginning to meditate again, Su Ping could even feel that just after such a brief period of meditation, he had an inkling once more!\nHis spiritual power was about to boil over again.\nFor a Beast Tamer, there’s no such thing as a void in the Realm from breaking through too quickly; after all, a Beast Tamer’s main combat power is tied to their Pet Beasts.\nSu Ping naturally wanted to seize this opportunity to fully grasp it.\nSure enough, with Su Ping’s meditation, his Realm broke through another level in the span of just one afternoon.\nWhat’s most important is that Su Ping could even feel that this was actually still not the end.\nHowever, allowing for some sedimentation, in the future, his meditation results might be several times better than at other times, and at the same time, future meditation practice would be much smoother.The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nBut now, Su Ping was actually already content!\nHe had risen from the average Fifth Rank to the average Seventh Rank.\nThis was just a little over a month after graduation. At such a speed, Su Ping believed that in the entire No. 6 High School, there was probably no one who could compare to him.\nHowever, after meeting Qin Xiaoxue and being exposed to a broader world, comparing myself to my schoolmates from No. 6 High School seems quite uninteresting, right?\nShaking his head, Su Ping got up and glanced out the window at the gradually darkening sky, ripples once again spreading in his heart.\nHe looked at the account balance on his phone with a sense of unreality.\nIs it time to readjust my mindset?\nSu Ping suddenly wondered.\nThis time, encountering Qin Xiaoxue was my lucky chance, which allowed me to come into contact with those two individuals who were clearly major figures in Linzhou City. And there was even that special wager. All these were the results of my abilities, but were those two figures not coveting me because of Qin Xiaoxue’s connections? Or looking at the situation, whether it was the Dragon Nation as a whole or in parts such as Jianghai Province and Linzhou City, for someone like me who showed potential and ability, was nurturing still the main focus? If that were the case, I could confidently display my abilities. If that led to gaining more benefits and resources, strengthening myself, why not do so?\nBut everything should be done in moderation.\nSu Ping knew that it was enough to continue cultivating the Forest Wolf; after all, if one had to say, that was also a skill passed down through his family.\nHowever, if he was too hasty in cultivating other Pet Beasts and inadvertently discovered some other Cultivation methods or perfected some rare Evolution paths, that would be too conspicuous.\nSteady progress is key! Only until my power is beyond any doubt.\nThis was the principle Su Ping set for himself. He took a slight breath. Connected in spirit, Su Ping could feel the change after his own breakthrough from the average Fifth Rank to the average Seventh Rank.\nSure enough, influenced by its master, Xiao Qing’s Realm had also received some feedback and improved.\nXiao Qing, who had just this morning reached the Proficient Level with the Sunlight Absorption Skill and had risen to the average Fifth Rank, had grown another size bigger. Its aura had also improved, reaching the average Sixth Rank.\nNow Xiao Qing was already the size of an adult wolfhound.\nThe growth in size of a Pet Beast mainly depends on the advancement in its Realm.\nAnd through various means to accelerate the Realm advancement of the Pet Beast, naturally, its size will also increase.\nHowever, with Xiao Qing’s current size, it clearly could not be held in his arms as it was a few days ago.\nNevertheless, the current Xiao Qing’s battle power had also become more evident.\nSu Ping smiled with satisfaction and soon took the equally eager Xiao Qing to the edge of the forest.\nThere was only half a month left for Woodhead’s training and the bet with Sun Chaoju.\nFifteen days to help Woodhead’s Self-Healing Skill break through to the Proficient Level would be a challenge for any ordinary Breeder, but it wouldn’t even affect Su Ping’s original training plan.\nHowever, Su Ping was not one to slack off; he might disregard his opponent strategically, but tactically, he still paid close attention.\nSo, there at the forest’s edge, at his command, the Forest Wolves from within the Dark Forest swiftly gathered, their green eyes in the dark night making for an eerie sight.\n\"Starting now, I will be drafting a training plan that calls for the little guys who most want to get stronger to participate!\"\nAt Su Ping’s command, almost all the Forest Wolves stood out, ready to try their luck.\nSu Ping smiled slightly. \"Don’t worry, all you little guys will participate tonight. We’ll just divide into two groups. One group will use Vine Strangling on the other to inflict injuries, while the other group will continuously use the Self-Healing Skill!\"\nHis orders were conveyed to all the Forest Wolves through Old Sha.\nVery quickly, the group of fewer than thirty Forest Wolves was divided into two groups, but just as Su Ping was about to initiate the skill-sharing link, he paused for a moment.\nBecause he then realized that the limit of fifteen Forest Wolves he could connect with had increased to seventeen!\nSo, the advancement of my own Realm also affected the number of Pet Beasts I could connect with?\nSu Ping let out a sigh of relief. An extra Forest Wolf in the connection meant that the skill level advancement would be twice as fast compared to before.\nNow, for Woodhead to improve the Skill Proficiency of Self-Healing, it would be seventeen times faster than practicing alone!\nThis terrifying concept was enough to allow all of Su Ping’s Pet Beasts to truly ’make up for lack of natural ability with diligence’ through sheer numbers!\nIn the ensuing night, among the twenty-seven Forest Wolves, the two groups were distinct: seventeen to be hit and ten to do the hitting. They began the practice of the ’Self-Healing’ Skill in the depth of the night.\nRegrettably, Little Ones and his own Xiao Qing, as they had not yet grasped the Self-Healing Skill, couldn’t join in the connection and had to join the attacking side instead.\nNevertheless, Su Ping didn’t mind, confident that with Xiao Qing’s Talent, mastering Self-Healing was just a matter of time.\nAfter giving some instructions, he left Old Sha in charge as the supervisor, making sure there were no irrecoverable casualties, and that training would continue until after twelve o’clock before ending.\nA balance between work and rest was the method for improvement. Furthermore, daytime was the best time to train Forest Wolves; with the Sunlight Absorption ability, they could rapidly recover Energy and stamina.\nAnd each night, after such a training session, Su Ping could go to Uncle Guan’s place the next day to discuss the Pet Beast rental business.\nThinking this, Su Ping sent a message to Uncle Guan, agreeing to meet the next morning to talk about the Pet Beast rental matters.\nOnly through real combat could the fighting power of these little guys be improved.\nAnd to have a place where they could unleash their combat abilities freely while also making some extra money, why not?\nRelaxed, Su Ping returned to his room, but just as he lay down contentedly, his phone pinged with a notification.\nIt was a private message, and it came from Li Shu.\nAfter leaving the group, the only schoolmate from No. 6 High School he was still in good contact with was Li Shu, with whom he got along well.\nThe content of the message was simple:\n\"Bro Ping, tomorrow’s the reunion! I’m gonna be there too. Are you ready to roll out the red carpet for me!?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 28: Chapter 28: Renting Out Pet Beasts, Trash Forest Wolf?\n「Yuntian Resort for Pet Beast Battles.」\nIt had to be said, compared to his own territory, this neighbor’s decorations here were truly admirable. There were even specially constructed roads, with shuttle buses circulating to pick up and drop off guests. The service was quite thorough. No wonder they were always trying to buy this place. Indeed, the construction investment wasn’t small.Follow current novels on NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nHowever, it was clear Su Ping was not in the mood to appreciate the scenery outside the window. He yawned.\nManager Guan, seated opposite him by the coffee table, smiled and glanced at him, \"Xiao Ping, didn’t sleep well last night?\"\nManager Guan clearly didn’t need to ask; the slightly dark circles under Su Ping’s eyes had already given him away.\nIt wasn’t because he was restless about Li Shu and his classmates visiting.\nRather, it was because he had truly completed Cultivation for the first time and earned so much money.\nThen, determined not to waste the effects of the Nurturing Ancient Tea, he had spent almost half the night in meditation.\nAfterward, he was up until dawn selecting Poison System resources for Xiao Qing and purchasing materials for the Heart of Woods Magic Potion.\nAs a result, his Realm had improved slightly, but he hadn’t advanced to the next Level.\nOf the more than four million he had earned, only a few tens of thousands remained.\nHowever, the thought of the resources about to be delivered to his doorstep lifted Su Ping’s spirits.\nIn addition to the materials for twenty Heart of Woods Magic Potions, he had also purchased four Poison System resources: Heartbane Fruit, Monkshood Wolf Poison, Oleander in Crimson, and Devil’s Willow Leaf.\nThese four were all herbal Poison System resources, and Devil’s Willow Leaf was even an Elite Level Poison System resource.\nIt had been confirmed that Xiao Qing’s Heart of the Poison Wood could grow by consuming Poison System resources. Naturally, Su Ping wouldn’t be stingy with his Soul Contracted Beast.\nManager Guan, seeing Su Ping wasn’t in the best condition, didn’t waste any more words and handed him the contract, saying, \"Xiao Ping, take a look. We at Yun Tian are really sincere about this! For your Forest Wolves, as long as they’re Ordinary Level, we guarantee five hundred a day per wolf—the same price for one battle. Elite Level ones are one thousand two hundred, also the same price per battle. Plus, professional recuperation and treatment facilities are available for free use, along with comprehensive accident insurance. You can rest assured!\"\nSu Ping nodded, read through it thoroughly from start to finish, and then nodded again, \"No problem. But Uncle Guan, I have one condition: I must be able to interrupt the rental at any time. After all, I get busy sometimes...\"\n\"No problem at all!\" Manager Guan smiled and waved his hand. This Pet Beast rental was just a pretext; the real goal was to get Su Ping to visit Yun Tian more often and build a closer relationship.\nSo, Manager Guan cleared his throat and said, \"Xiao Ping, as you’ve seen, I, your Uncle Guan, am truly sincere. I know a bit about your Heart of Woods’ situation. Forest Wolves are a foundational Pet Beast in Linzhou City, so there are many cultivation bases. Your dad has never cared about this aspect, but I know how Heart of Woods is doing. As the young manager of such a large cultivation base, life must not be easy for you, right? We at Yun Tian are genuinely interested in this land! What about this number?\"\nAs he finished speaking, Manager Guan didn’t wait for Su Ping to respond and handed over a note. It had a string of zeros on it. It had to be said, the offer was indeed very sincere.\nBut Su Ping still said helplessly, \"Uncle Guan, this land was left by my grandfather. You know my dad. Even though he can be unreliable, he takes this matter very seriously. If I dared to do such a thing behind his back, he’d break my legs. And I really don’t need the money right now.\"\n\"Don’t worry. When your dad comes back, I’ll talk to him. How about that?\"\n\"Uncle Guan, please don’t put me in a difficult position... How about this, let me take you to see my Forest Wolves. I’m renting out sixteen: ten Ordinary Level and six Elite Level...\"\nWithout giving him a chance to respond, Su Ping hastily got up and led Manager Guan out the door.\nWhen they arrived at the open space in front of the main building, a figure stood there, face dark with frustration, tugging on a rope. Surrounding her were seventeen Forest Wolves.\nQin Xiaoxue finally saw Su Ping arrive, albeit late, and seemed to breathe a sigh of relief.\nWho had ever made her do something like this in her entire life?\nOnly this brat would treat her, the esteemed Miss Qin, like a servant girl!\nEspecially with so many people casting curious glances her way.\nSo embarrassing!\nBut, surprisingly, despite being surrounded by this wolf pack and feeling embarrassed by the curious onlookers, Qin Xiaoxue had to admit it. The reason was simple: among the seventeen Forest Wolves, besides the sixteen Su Ping was renting out, one was her own Woodhead. And in just one night, even though Woodhead’s Self-Healing Level hadn’t improved, the feedback from their soul connection clearly told her that Woodhead had made great progress!\nThis brat really had some skill!\nHowever, Qin Xiaoxue’s gaze toward Su Ping flickered thoughtfully.\nAlthough she had a straightforward and fiery temper, she wasn’t actually foolish.\nIf the Yuntian Resort was backed by the Tianyun Group, that would be truly terrifying.\nWith the Tianyun Group as its backer, and even its chairman personally involved with Su Ping, could it all really be just about renting these dozen or so Forest Wolves?\nDon’t be ridiculous.\nThat was clearly impossible.\nRemembering their conversation that day, Qin Xiaoxue felt she had to remind Su Ping later not to be sold and still help the buyer count the money.\nAnd, as expected, Manager Guan merely glanced at them, nodded, and then said straightforwardly, \"You take these little guys to the training grounds first and wait to see if any Beast Tamers will choose them. I’ll transfer the money to you personally this evening. However, think over that matter carefully. Even if not for anything else, consider it for your own future.\"\nAfter Manager Guan left, Su Ping waved his hand and, with a visibly upset Qin Xiaoxue and the seventeen Forest Wolves, including Woodhead, headed towards the training grounds at the back.\nQin Xiaoxue watched the guy in front of her, who showed no intention of helping, and her anger flared.\nIs this brat really treating me like a servant girl?\nBut before she could speak, a voice came from nearby, \"Isn’t that Su Ping? I was thinking of checking on Su the Young Master later, but here we bump into each other. What a coincidence, huh?\"\nSu Ping frowned. A group of people was rapidly approaching from not far away, having just stepped off a shuttle bus. The speaker was none other than Zhou Shuchen, the class president of Class Six-Two, whom he hadn’t seen in over a month.\nSu Ping had never particularly liked this guy, but he’d never found him this obnoxious before.\nHowever, Su Ping couldn’t be bothered with him and quickly spotted Li Shu waving from the crowd.\nHe’d heard from Li Shu yesterday that he was coming today; he just hadn’t expected him so early.\nBut just then, Zhou Shuchen’s next words made Su Ping freeze, \"I heard everything just now. Since when did Su the Young Master become so destitute? Having to rent out these trashy Forest Wolves to make a small buck?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 29: Chapter 29: The Life Ancient Tree, Qin Xiaoxue’s Anger!\nA simple sentence instantly turned the atmosphere icy cold.\nThe source of this chill was definitely not just Su Ping; even more, it was Qin Xiaoxue, who already harbored grievances.\nTrash Forest Wolves?\nshe thought.\nAmong these Forest Wolves is my, Miss Qin’s, own Woodhead! Besides, Forest Wolves are not trash!\nThus, the corners of Miss Qin’s mouth curled up, revealing a smile Su Ping had never seen on her cheeks before.\nAlthough she wore sunglasses, her beauty, hard for ordinary people to match, could still be discerned.\nIn Linzhou City, that might be fine. However, at the Magic Capital Advanced Beast-Taming Academy, things were different. Unless it was a newcomer who had just enrolled, everyone else would definitely flee as far as possible upon seeing such a smile.\nBecause this signified that the young lady was truly angry.\nSeemingly sensing the fluctuations in its master’s emotions, Woodhead’s body was instantly clad in wooden armor. In the next moment, the massive Forest Wolf had appeared before Zhou Shuchen. Its extended wood spike claws were only half an inch from his heart.\nAn indifferent voice came through the cold atmosphere, \"How are you serving as class president? Didn’t Teacher Yang tell you when you enrolled that there are no truly weak Pet Beasts, only Beast Tamers who haven’t found the right development and training path?\"\nZhou Shuchen looked at the enormous wolf, whose eyes were filled with cold, murderous intent, and he instinctively backed away, almost falling to the ground. He looked at Su Ping, saying, \"Su Ping, have you gone mad...\"\nHowever, just then, a figure quickly descended from the bus, looking at Qin Xiaoxue, who had made the move, \"Who are you? Don’t you know you can’t let Pet Beasts attack people at will? Do you have any respect for the Beast Master Association at all?\"\nThis was a forceful voice, belonging to a man in his thirties.\nUpon seeing this figure, Su Ping was slightly startled. The figure was none other than Director Zhang of No. 6 Middle School, Zhang Guowei.\nBy his side stood an equally unfamiliar young man with an arrogant demeanor. Yet, looking at the Forest Wolf and Qin Xiaoxue, he also showed surprise.\nQin Xiaoxue’s gaze shifted. She glanced at the self-righteous Zhang Guowei, then smiled again.\nThen, a glow arose, and a figure Su Ping had never seen before appeared by her side.\nLooking at this figure, Su Ping was stunned, as were Zhang Guowei, Zhou Shuchen, and everyone else who had gotten off the bus.\nIt was a massive tree that stood three meters tall. The tree was a lush green, surrounded by an endless aura of life, yet there was an indescribable sense of eeriness about it. On its trunk, an ancient and bizarre face gazed calmly at the people before it.\nA Monarch-level Species with Racial Potential in the special Plant System category: the Life Ancient Tree!\nNo, something is amiss,\nSu Ping thought, looking at the Life Ancient Tree and instinctively feeling something was wrong.\nThis is definitely not an ordinary Life Ancient Tree! Previously, I couldn’t have articulated what was amiss. However, after contracting with Xiao Qing and gaining a deeper understanding of such Pet Beasts, I sense it. This Life Ancient Tree is different from common Life Ancient Trees; it’s a mutated one! There are additional scents and auras emanating from it. A bloodline and species mutation! This is a Monarch-level Pet Beast; what value has its mutation reached?\nNot only Su Ping, but everyone else was dumbfounded. Some connoisseurs in the crowd had even started to back away, not daring to watch any longer.\nIn any era, many individuals are worlds apart from ordinary people. Even an average Pet Beast with Monarch Racial Potential was beyond the imagination of any common Beast Tamer, let alone a mutated one.\nCommander and Monarch: seemingly only one level of difference, but it was as vast as the chasm between clouds and mud!\nAfter seeing the Life Ancient Tree, Zhang Guowei was also stunned.\nWhat on earth is this?\nhe wondered.\n\"Now you tell the Beast Master Association to come and deal with this. Let’s see if they dare!\" Qin Xiaoxue approached with graceful steps, her tone describable by only one word: unrestrained!\nHowever, she quickly added, \"The Beast Master Association has long-established regulations. All Pet Beasts in the Dragon Nation’s Beastmaster Society, as long as they are not Ferocious Beasts with a strong desire to kill and attack humans, are entitled to basic rights!\n\"Furthermore, Pet Beasts that reach a certain level of intelligence and have Innate deficiencies must not be provoked or insulted face-to-face by any Beast Tamers. Otherwise, those Beast Tamers will bear the consequences themselves! Do I really need to spell these things out for you? Let alone the fact I haven’t even acted; even if these Forest Wolves killed you, you’d deserve it. Utterly clueless!\"\nZhang Guowei’s complexion turned extremely ugly, while Zhou Shuchen’s face became ashen. He was merely a recently graduated student. Despite having a starting point that his ordinary peers could hardly imagine, he had become arrogant in the spur of the moment, oblivious to the dangers and terrors of the outside world.\nIt was naturally impossible for Zhang Guowei to go to the Beast Master Association or any security department. It didn’t matter whether what Qin Xiaoxue said was true. Even if it were false, the moment the Life Ancient Tree appeared, he understood that for some people, right or wrong held no meaning.\nAt this moment, Su Ping finally spoke up, \"Forget it. Let him learn his lesson, and that’ll be the end of it.\"\nLooking at Su Ping, Qin Xiaoxue could tell that these people knew him, and this ignorant fool was mostly targeting Su Ping alone.\nQin Xiaoxue harrumphed coldly, and the gigantic Life Ancient Tree slowly disappeared. She rejoined the wolf pack with Woodhead.\nSu Ping’s demeanor remained unchanged. Facing Zhang Guowei’s complex gaze, he even smiled and said, \"Director Zhang, everyone, I’ll take the Forest Wolves to the Pet Beast battling venue first. Once you’ve settled into your rooms, come find me to hang out! I’ll be around.\"ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt\nEveryone watched as the duo passed by them, heading toward the huge venue ahead.\nSu Ping bore no anger. Even though he had withdrawn from the group and had no intention of forming deep associations with his old classmates and teachers, there was no need for him to adopt an arrogant, vindictive attitude and ignore them.\nOn the contrary, Qin Xiaoxue’s expression was still somewhat sour.\nHowever, before the two could get far, rapid footsteps approached.\n\"Foster father, wait for me~\"\nAs expected, Su Ping turned his head. It was none other than the thick-browed Li Shu, who hurried over, hugging Su Ping tightly, his eyes fixated on Qin Xiaoxue.\nHis Pet Beast was also of the Plant System, just a Luozisong (Pine) with Elite Level Racial Potential, worlds apart from the Life Ancient Tree. But clearly, Su Ping’s relatively good relationship with him was thanks to Li Shu’s unparalleled knack for hitting it off with people.\n\"Hello, beautiful lady! My name is Li Shu—Li as in ’pear blossoms,’ Shu as in ’a pear tree of blossoms overwhelms the begonias’! I am Bro Ping’s sworn son. I’m skilled in the Six Arts of a Gentleman, so if you need anything, feel free to seek me out.\"\nQin Xiaoxue looked at this thick-browed fellow with suspicion.\nThe Six Arts of a Gentleman? And I should seek him out if needed? Could he be a Breeder with special skills? But then again, for someone to have a good relationship with a Genius Breeder like Su Ping, and to be friends with a hidden dragon like him in such a small pond, he surely must possess remarkable traits, right?\nWith that in mind, she belatedly nodded her head.\nHowever, this ’Six Arts of a Gentleman’ is unfamiliar. It seems different from specialized Beast Tamer paths like Breeders, Mechanists, and Necromancers? Yet, it must represent some impressive ability, I presume.\nBlack lines had already appeared on Su Ping’s forehead.\nThe Six Arts of a Gentleman: Unshakable Composure, Scornful Amusement, The ’It’s a Classic!’ Takedown, Provoking Fury, Ironic ’Devotion,’ and Stunning into Silence.\nProclaimed as the ultimate arsenal of the keyboard warrior, mastering even one art allows dominance in cyber surfing, ensuring invincibility. With these six skills in hand, one could roam unmatched!\nOf course, Qin Xiaoxue, a ’normie’ Beast Tamer, had no clue about this. If she really sought out Li Shu in the future and realized she had been played, Miss Qin, not known for her good temper, would make things difficult. Su Ping would also have a hard time explaining. With no other choice, he covered his face in resignation and said, \"Don’t mind him. Sometimes, like you, his mind isn’t quite right.\"\nQin Xiaoxue nodded. \"I see.\"\nThen, after three seconds, she realized what he had implied and glared at Su Ping, \"What do you mean by that, you jerk?\"\n\"...\"",

      "content": "Chapter 30: Chapter 30: Pet Beast Battle, Zhou Shuchen’s Challenge! (First one, please vote)\nPreviously, Su Ping wasn’t sure whether Yun Tian’s Pet Beast Combat Resort would be profitable. But upon seeing numerous Beast Tamers constantly coming in and out of the vast venue, he realized his vision had been too narrow.\nMy perspective was too limited.\nAll business involving Pet Beasts is extremely expensive. The same applies to charging for Pet Beast battles.\nFighting with friends naturally doesn’t incur extra costs. Yun Tian even waives these basic arena usage fees, as long as no significant damage is caused.\nHowever, after a battle, treatments and the recovery of strength and energy are always necessary, aren’t they? Otherwise, how could anyone enjoy themselves to the fullest?\nThis is where the major expenses come into play. If one chooses to practice with Pet Beasts provided by Yun Tian, it costs even more.\nEven for combat, if one wishes to fight to their heart’s content, spending several thousand to tens of thousands in a day is quite normal.\nPet Beasts represent the largest consumer group in this world.\nThis is also normal, as a Beast Tamer’s main combat power relies on their Pet Beasts. These pets are key to their personal advancement to transcendent power and social mobility. If they were so easy to obtain, it would indeed be unreasonable.\nAnd this vast venue is just one of the combat training facilities in Yun Tian’s resort. Even so, this facility includes arena battles, virtual simulation fights, open-air combat, and various simulated terrain battles.\nNo wonder business is booming; Yun Tian has really invested heavily.\nLooking at all this, Su Ping was brimming with enthusiasm. However, he still followed them to a separate training ground.\nThis was an open-air training area, and also the territory where Su Ping had settled his Forest Wolves. Even if it was a rental arrangement, not all of his Forest Wolves would be chosen to leave. Su Ping needed a space where he could train while waiting for battles.\nQin Xiaoxue also watched Su Ping with great interest as he stood before the Forest Wolves. She was genuinely intrigued by him and even more curious about how he trained his Pet Beasts.\nJust then, her phone rang. Qin Xiaoxue’s eyebrows immediately furrowed. After a short while, she said to Su Ping, \"Su Ping, I have some business in Linzhou City. I’ll be back soon!\"\nSu Ping didn’t mind and nodded.\nMeanwhile, Li Shu, who had watched Qin Xiaoxue leave, finally breathed a sigh of relief. He then rushed over to Su Ping, winking and nudging him. \"Bro Ping, Brother Ping, foster dad, when will you pass on your unparalleled techniques to me?\"\n\"What unparalleled techniques?\"\n\"Your secrets to wooing women, of course!\" Li Shu was almost jumping up and down. \"No wonder you weren’t interested in Yin Yin, even though she clearly likes you! Turns out you already knew such a top-tier beauty!\"\nSu Ping looked at him skeptically.\nWe’ve barely interacted, or perhaps that earlier display wasn’t meant for him. Otherwise, Zhou Shuchen and the previously mentioned Sun Chaoju would serve as examples.\n\"Besides, when has Yin Yin ever been interested in me? Stop spreading such nonsense...\"\nBefore Su Ping could finish, a voice came from behind him, \"Exactly! Li Shu, stop spreading rumors!\"\nLi Shu turned his head. Sure enough, Zhou Shuchen and the other students, who had just paid the deposit, were approaching. Among them was Yin Yin, whose face seemed to turn a little red, apparently having overheard the conversation.Follow current novels on\nHowever, the earlier scene had clearly subdued the increasingly haughty class monitor, Zhou Shuchen. He seemed to breathe a sigh of relief when he didn’t see Qin Xiaoxue.\nZhou Shuchen glared hatefully at Su Ping.\nInitially, he had some reservations about Su Ping but hadn’t created any overt conflicts. However, after graduation, both he and Su Ping were approached by Zhang Guowei, who saw potential in them. He had joyfully accepted Zhang Guowei’s recommendation and even convinced his parents to spend all their savings on a down payment for a Commander Level Pet Beast, the Crimson Fang Tiger. Although he also signed a contract with the Fire King Company and took out a loan of several million, he believed it was all worth it. It was all worth it for a superior future, for becoming a powerful Beast Tamer, and for making his parents proud so they could live a good life. What’s a little hardship now?\nHowever, this guy actually refused Director Zhang’s kindness? Is it just because his family has some money? What’s so great about Su Ping? His first contracted Pet Beast was just a Forest Wolf. Although the Forest Wolf is an Elite Peak level Pet Beast, it still falls far short compared to the Crimson Fang Tiger. He had better options, yet he chose to contract a Forest Wolf. Isn’t that willingly degrading himself? Moreover, he actually chose to give up the better development opportunities in Linzhou City to come here to the suburbs and inherit this Beast Tamer base. In his eyes, Su Ping was simply unwilling to strive for better, preferring to coast on his family’s wealth—a degenerate! How could such a person compare to someone like him, who struggles against fate with effort? Thinking of his own future rise, he would sometimes be so moved by his own dedication that he wanted to cry.\nAnd Su Ping? Compared to his own destined future as a powerful Beast Tamer, what was Su Ping? What was so great about him? Aside from the title deed for this Heart of Woods Forest Wolf breeding base, the facilities worth tens of millions, the resources, and these dozens of Forest Wolves also valued at over ten million—what else does he have?! He can only live out the rest of his predictable, tedious life.\nAnd what about him, Zhou Shuchen? Aside from a debt of several million, he had a bright future, vast prospects, and the heart of a strong Beast Tamer! That was enough.\nHowever, the strong unsheathe their swords against the stronger, while the weak throw their fists at the weaker.\nTherefore, Zhou Shuchen didn’t dare bare his teeth at Qin Xiaoxue, who could summon the Life Ancient Tree. But after she left, his gaze towards Su Ping turned even more resentful.\nSu Ping really didn’t want to bother with this guy. After a glance, he turned to Yin Yin in the crowd and said with a frank smile, \"Yin Yin, sorry about that. Li Shu is just like that; don’t take offense to his loose tongue.\"\nAs the recognized school belle of No. 6 High, Yin Yin’s looks naturally needed no compliment. It was just a bit of a pity that her figure was quite flat.\nMeeting Su Ping’s smile, Yin Yin also smiled faintly. \"It’s fine. Besides, he wasn’t wrong.\"\n\"OOOH...\"\nAt her response, Yin Yin’s face turned slightly red, and the surrounding classmates erupted in a chorus of teasing. Li Shu even let out a few whoops.\nThis was probably the nature of youth.\nHowever, Su Ping knew that Yin Yin’s true thoughts might be different.\nHaving been classmates for years, he understood this school belle very well. She was quite mature, different from other young girls, and always knew exactly what she wanted. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have become the widely recognized school belle of No. 6 High. She was like Zhou Shuchen, not content with being ordinary, only her thoughts ran deeper. She wouldn’t act like Zhou Shuchen, getting carried away by a little success.\nHowever, Su Ping didn’t care.\nAfter all, once they graduated, they would belong to different worlds. Though, in truth, he did quite admire this school belle.\nHowever, while Su Ping didn’t care, someone else clearly did. Which young man didn’t admire beauty? Yin Yin’s good looks were one thing, but the title of \"school belle\" was an even greater stimulant for the male students.\nPreviously, Zhou Shuchen hadn’t thought about it, but now, things were obviously different.\nHearing the teasing around him, Zhou Shuchen clenched his fists.\nHe had come here believing he should be the center of attention! Now, this guy had stolen all the attention, just like back in school. But now, he finally had the means to fight back.\nSo, Zhou Shuchen leaped into the center of the open-air training battlefield and shouted, \"We’re here to train our Pet Beasts for battle, not to chitchat about romance! It’s one thing to waste our own time, but let’s not delay Director Zhang and Brother Gold!\"\nAs he spoke, everyone indeed turned their gaze towards him. Meeting everyone’s gaze, he then looked at Su Ping. \"Su Ping, how about we have a match?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 31: Chapter 31: Instakill! Su Ping Cheating? (Second Release for Votes)\nAs soon as these words came out, everyone’s gaze turned involuntarily toward Su Ping.\nLi Shu beside him couldn’t hold back anymore:\n\"Zhou Shuchen, do you have no shame? Let’s not mention that Su Ping’s Forest Wolf inherently has less Racial Potential than your Crimson Fang Tiger. You’ve had your contracted Crimson Fang Tiger for over a month, while Su Ping hasn’t even reached half a month yet. Moreover, the Crimson Fang Tiger has an Attribute advantage over the Forest Wolf. What were you thinking?\"\nOnce these words were spoken, the expressions of some people turned somewhat strange. This class monitor was too petty. Besides, previously, it was clearly you who provoked first, and it backfired when a beautiful woman by his side scared you off. Now that the lady is gone, you gain confidence?\nBut Zhou Shuchen didn’t care about these.\nIn this world, the strongest power is the best reputation; what else matters? I am about to let Su Ping and these guys know that things are no longer as they were before. Now, I am the master of the Commander Level Pet Beast, the Crimson Fang Tiger, a Beast Tamer with boundless potential! And Su Ping, besides his so-called decent family conditions, has nothing else to boast about. This guy, who always remains calm, is irritating to me.\nHis gaze was firmly fixed on Su Ping.\n\"What, are you afraid?\"\nSeeing that Su Ping didn’t speak, Zhou Shuchen deliberately showed a haughty attitude.\nHowever, Su Ping just shook his head:\n\"Of course, there’s nothing I’m afraid of. However, you should think it through; my Forest Wolf is rented out, so if you want to challenge me, it will cost you money!\"\nCost money?\nZhou Shuchen’s expression stiffened, but he quickly recovered:\n\"Hmph, I wouldn’t bat an eye at such a trivial amount of money. Just come at me!\"\n\"Alright then!\"\nIf someone wants to get beaten, I wouldn’t refuse,\nSu Ping thought.\nAlthough to me, defeating such a person in a Pet Beast battle wouldn’t be much help to me or my Pet Beast, earning money is earning money, no matter whose it is.\nHe slowly walked onto the outdoor battle arena:\n\"Little Ones!\"\n\"AWOO...\"\nLittle Ones, already the size of a wolf dog, came to Su Ping’s side.\nSu Ping smiled and rubbed Little Ones’ head.\nHe didn’t summon Xiao Qing.\nUsing Xiao Qing to bully Zhou Shuchen would truly be overkill. Although it’s pretty much the same now, earning money is still earning money.\nCurrently, Xiao Qing and Little Ones were of the same Level, both Ordinary Sixth Stage. But an Ordinary Fourth Stage Xiao Qing could easily overpower a Sixth Rank Little Ones, and with Poison Vine Strangulation, Xiao Qing could instantly kill it if it wished. The terrifying poison would render the opponent powerless instantly.\nA Pet Beast battle with such a disparity in strength is inherently meaningless.\nAfter all, Su Ping watched as Zhou Shuchen summoned his fiery red Crimson Fang Tiger, which was no bigger than a Pekinese. Though the cub was small, it already had the roar of a tiger that resonated through the woods, but Su Ping could tell at a glance that this Crimson Fang Tiger was currently just an Ordinary Third Stage. Compared to Little Ones, who was the size of a wolf dog, it was undeniably inferior.\nZhou Shuchen failed to see the gap in Rank.\nHowever, Zhao Guowei and the person on the platform whom Zhou Shuchen called Brother Gold clearly saw it. But after exchanging a glance and seeing the astonishment in each other’s eyes, they chose to remain silent. In the end, for them, these were just kids squabbling. More importantly, although Zhou Shuchen was outwardly their man and closer to them, the shock that Qin Xiaoxue had given them was too great.\nThat woman with a Monarch Level potential pet beast, what is her relationship with Su Ping?\nThese were the concerns of those who had been navigating society for many years.\nTherefore, speaking up at this moment to remind him would amount to offending Su Ping, an act not worth the potential loss.\nSo, at this moment, they all wisely chose not to speak.\nAs for Zhou Shuchen, he was already completely carried away by excitement; how could he have the mind to think about these matters?\nThere was no need for a professional referee to declare the start. Once some safety officers saw that everyone was in position, they activated the Energy Shield that prevented the spread of Energy.\n\"Su Ping, I’ll let you know that I am no longer the person I was before!\"\nLooking at the overexcited Zhou Shuchen, Su Ping really couldn’t understand.\nWhy is this guy targeting me so much?\nHowever, he didn’t need to ponder things that were meaningless to him, because the next moment, at Zhou Shuchen’s command, the slightly baby-voiced Crimson Fang Tiger had already pounced.\n\"Go! Crimson Cloud, Flaming Pounce!\"\nNot only that, even Zhou Shuchen’s own body shimmered with a faint red hue; his Talent—Fire Element affinity—could to some extent increase the combat power of his Pet Beast. It was indeed a fairly impressive Beast Taming Talent.\nAnd at this moment, everyone finally saw why the Crimson Fang Tiger, with its Racial Potential reaching Commander Level, could give Zhou Shuchen such great confidence.\n\"ROAR...\"\nThe deep roar carried a certain weight, and flames spattered over the body of the pouncing Crimson Fang Tiger, as if it would envelop its entire figure!\n\"An Ordinary Third Stage! Our class president’s Crimson Fang Tiger has grown quite quickly!\"\n\"Not just in Level, but Skills too!\"\nSome spectators pointed out the key aspect: indeed, what made Zhou Shuchen so proud was that in just half a month, the Crimson Fang Tiger had mastered the Racial Skill: Flaming Pounce. It was this Skill that truly transformed it.\nFire Element is a complete counter to Wood Element, a basic principle of elemental restraint taught since school. Not to mention, the Crimson Fang Tiger’s Racial Potential was even higher than that of the Forest Wolf.\nIn other words, in the eyes of the classmates—except for Li Shu, who was blindly confident in Su Ping, and even Yin Yin, who was quite optimistic about Su Ping—none believed that under such circumstances, the Forest Wolf could be a match for the Crimson Fang Tiger.\nThe burning flames seemed to emanate a fearsome temperature that could still be felt despite the Energy Shield’s separation. Even a juvenile Crimson Fang Tiger was not something an ordinary Low-Level Pet Beast could compare with.Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs NovᴇlFirenᴇt\nHowever, it was a pity that the Crimson Fang Tiger indeed had the Attribute advantage over Little Ones, and its Racial Potential was higher. But Little Ones was not an ordinary Low-Level Forest Wolf.\nThe main combat Skills of the Forest Wolf were, in fact, just two: one was accelerated growth, and the other was Vine Strangling. The former amplified the Forest Wolf’s physical combat Ability, similar to a boosting Skill, while the latter involved summoning vines to bind and strangle. Both Skills belonged to the Wood Element. And any Wood Element Skill would be strengthened by the Heart of Woods!\nSuddenly, as it faced the pouncing Crimson Fang Tiger, Little Ones’ pupils seemed to burst with brilliance. Its body grew another size larger in an instant! How much stronger was it compared to the ordinary beginner-level accelerated growth? It was now the size of a small calf, seemingly having grown into an adult Forest Wolf in an instant.\nIn the animal kingdom, under normal conditions, the size of the body acts as an indicator of combat strength. Unless there are excessively astonishing supernatural Abilities at play, the strength and speed brought about by size alone can be overwhelming!\nAt this very moment, it was exactly the case!\nWatching the flaming kitty charge towards it, Little Ones didn’t take it lightly and used its most simplistic Ability, leaping first to smack it away with a swipe of its paw. Then, the speed at which it sprang forward was even faster than the speed at which the Crimson Fang Tiger was sent flying, and the large wolf’s maw snapped at the pouncing flaming kitty!\n\"ROAR... MEOW!\"\nThe shrill cry that rang out startled Zhou Shuchen awake. It was only after seeing his ’Crimson Cloud’ merely knocked out by that slap and subsequent bite that he finally breathed a sigh of relief.\nThe wretched Forest Wolf then looked at Su Ping with innocent eyes.\nBut at this time, Zhou Shuchen, who had become the class president of Sixth Middle, finally reacted and looked at Su Ping angrily:\n\"This is an Ordinary Sixth Stage Forest Wolf! It’s not your Contracted Beast! Su Ping, you’re cheating!\"\nSuddenly, all the spectators, who were surprised at the unexpectedly quick end of the first Pet Beast battle, turned their eyes toward Su Ping.",

      "content": "Chapter 32: Chapter 32: Su Ping’s Contracted Pet Beast? Xiao Qing Enters the Scene! (Third Release, Seeking Votes)\nUnder everyone’s gaze, Su Ping, his expression unchanging, didn’t even acknowledge the guy at first. He just smiled and patted the head of Little One, who had quickly run over.Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\n\"Well done.\"\nThen, he turned directly to the staff member responsible for recording this area and held up one finger.\n\"One, please record it for me, thank you.\"\nThe staff member nodded, knowing it was about Su Ping’s Pet Beast combat rental business.\nAfter all this, Su Ping turned, leading Little One down from the arena, and then said with a smile, \"Well, you never said you wanted to fight my Contracted Beast. I have so many Forest Wolves here. Naturally, I’d pick the most suitable one!\"\nZhou Shuchen glared, and some chuckles came from the side.\nIndeed, Zhou Shuchen had only asked Su Ping for a Controlling Beasts battle; he never specified it had to be against Su Ping’s Contracted Beast. Now, not only had he failed to show off, but he’d also been beaten for nothing and had even wasted money renting a Pet Beast for the fight.\nSu Ping wasn’t sure about the fees here, but how could the other students, who had discussed coming here in their group chat, not know? This amount was negligible for Su Ping and some students, but for Zhou Shuchen, who had already amassed millions in debt, it clearly wasn’t as trivial as he had claimed.\nHowever, the young man standing next to Zhang Guowei narrowed his eyes slightly, observing Little One, who had returned to its normal size, a hint of surprise in his gaze. As an employee of Fire King Company, and a member of the Cultivation department responsible for observing and assessing the potential of Pet Beasts for the company’s newly signed prospective graduate reserves, he instinctively felt something was off about this Forest Wolf. However, his Talent was not the Eye of Truth, and it was impolite to casually use one’s Talent to observe another’s Pet Beasts. He could only cast thoughtful glances at the peculiar Little Forest Wolf from time to time.\nAt this moment, Zhou Shuchen, obviously unaware of these details, was flushed with anger—even more so than when he had been using his Fire Element Affinity.\nHe glared at Su Ping resentfully. \"Su Ping, do you dare to fight again, this time using your Pet Beast bound by a Soul Contract?\"\nHe had completely lost his senses. The high cost of this place was utterly forgotten; all he wanted now was revenge. He yearned to defeat this perpetually pretentious guy and trample him underfoot! He had even prepared taunting words, yet the unexpected happened once more.\nSu Ping nodded once more. Facing Zhou Shuchen’s furious gaze, he maintained his usual calm expression. \"Sure. But you should take your Pet Beast to recover and awaken first. There’s no rush; we can fight after your Pet Beast has recovered.\"\nHis reminder was well-intentioned.\nAfter all, he earned money per fight. If people were eager to hand over cash, why would he object?\nZhou Shuchen also came to his senses but merely snorted coldly, holding his Crimson Fang Tiger as he approached the already prepared recovery medical room.\nAt this point, some other students who had witnessed the recent battle also perked up. They found suitable opponents at random and took to the field for Pet Beast duels, including Li Shu and Yin Yin.\nLi Shu’s Luozisong was a Plant Type Pet Beast, which generally had average mobility. The Luozisong’s combat strength was decent; by swinging its branches, it could activate the Skill ’Pine Bomb.’ This was an extremely powerful attack method, and it was rare for Low-level Plant System Pet Beasts to possess such combat effectiveness. Unfortunately, Li Shu’s Luozisong hadn’t yet mastered this Skill. So, facing its opponent, a Saber-toothed Marmot, it could only wave its branches continuously, unable to inflict any damage. Li Shu watched in frustration, gritting his teeth.\nYin Yin’s Pet Beast, on the other hand, was rather special and worth mentioning. It was a unique Pet Beast called ’Cloud Butterfly’ with Racial Potential reaching Elite Peak. Its combat power was actually quite ordinary; it could create illusory mists and release intoxicating fragrances. However, its appearance was incredibly beautiful and matched Yin Yin’s overall temperament quite well. Additionally, combined with Yin Yin’s ’Traceless’ Talent, she momentarily resembled a fairy dancing in the mist. She bewildered the opponent’s ’Spider with Silk Entanglement’—which also had average combat power—so thoroughly that, with the spider being at a species disadvantage, both the opposing Beast Tamer and Pet Beast were left completely disoriented.\nSomewhat interesting.\nSu Ping nodded as he watched the scene on stage. The Traceless Talent could increase a Beast Tamer’s speed and was very helpful for dodging Pet Beast attacks. Although it couldn’t directly increase his own or his Pet Beasts’ combat power, it was still quite a practical Ability.\nCombined with her looks, it was clear how captivating she was; in just a short while, besides her classmates, many other Beast Tamers had gathered to watch. Those who came here were all young people, and quite a few wanted to show off after seeing such a beauty.\nAnd in this Pet Beast training combat venue, how does one show off? Undoubtedly, through strength.\nAnd in this arena, the only one renting out Pet Beasts for combat was Su Ping.\nThis made Su Ping feel very pleased. This campus belle actually had such benefits and uses! Once I become richer, should I also hire a few pretty faces to entice these naive and wealthy young Beast Tamers into becoming big spenders? Su Ping felt it had great potential.\n\"Bro Ping, doing this, how much can you earn in a day?\" Li Shu came up and asked excitedly.\nNot far away, Zhou Shuchen, who was waiting for his Crimson Fang Tiger to recover in the treatment room, also pricked up his ears; he wanted to listen in too.\nHow much money can this degenerate fellow, who only cares about money and reeks of its stench, actually earn?\nSu Ping smiled faintly, not avoiding the others. \"Not counting the base, just from these recent Pet Beast fights, the earnings are about twelve thousand plus!\"\nOrdinary Level Pet Beasts fight for five hundred a session, Elite Level for twelve hundred. Currently, except for Little One, none were unoccupied, and Zhou Shuchen had just paid for Little One’s session. That was exactly the amount.\n\"GASP! That’s really easy money!\"\nLi Shu was somewhat envious. His dad, as the editor-in-chief of a media company, earned a monthly salary of just over twenty thousand, which was already considered good in Linzhou.\nZhou Shuchen, on the side, had bloodshot eyes and clenched his fists tightly.\nMoney! If he truly didn’t care about money as he claimed, why hadn’t he paid off his debts first? Thinking of this, Zhou Shuchen felt even more resentful. Just wait! Once his Crimson Fang Tiger recovers, I’ll teach this guy that his money isn’t so easy to earn!\nHowever, just as this thought arose, two identical figures approached Su Ping.\n\"Excuse me, are you the one renting out these Forest Wolves? Do you have any left? My brother and I want to train in coordinated Pet Beast combat and need two that can fight together. Do you have any Forest Wolves between Ordinary Fifth Rank and Ordinary Seventh Rank?\"\nSu Ping looked at the twin brothers before him, slightly stunned.\nIt seems the only one left under my command is Little One.\nThe twin brothers seemed to understand the situation and scratched their heads. From the side, Zhou Shuchen sneered sarcastically, \"Su Ping, don’t you also have a Contracted Beast? Why not team it up with that Forest Wolf? Though, I’m not sure if your Contracted Beast meets their Level requirements!\"\nClearly, Zhou Shuchen’s words were sarcastic. After all, Su Ping had just instantly defeated his Crimson Fang Tiger with Little One, without using his own Contracted Beast. Even though Zhou Shuchen hadn’t specified it beforehand, this led the surrounding classmates to believe that Su Ping’s other Forest Wolf was probably no match for his Crimson Fang Tiger! Naturally, it seemed Su Ping couldn’t meet the twin Beast Tamers’ request for a Pet Beast between Fifth and Seventh Rank.\nHowever, these words seemed to remind Su Ping. He met the expectant gazes of the twin customers and nodded.\n\"Alright then.\"\nSubsequently, under the bewildered stares of Zhou Shuchen and all the surrounding classmates, a white light flashed, and Xiao Qing, who hadn’t yet had a chance to appear, finally debuted!",

      "content": "Chapter 33: Chapter 33: Combined Attack Technique? Are We Still Fighting? (Four More for Votes)\nZhou Shuchen was stunned; he had truly intended only to mock Su Ping with his remark.\nAfter all, how could such a high-level Contracted Beast be summoned? If Su Ping’s Contracted Beast had reached this level, why would he use a rented Pet Beast to fight him?\nThat clearly didn’t make sense!\nAnd it wasn’t scientific either.\nBut the moment Su Ping nodded in agreement and the summoning light vanished, the proud Forest Wolf that appeared by Su Ping’s side was of the exact same size as the previous one!\nWhat was even stranger and more bizarre was the color of this Forest Wolf’s fur—it was significantly more lustrous than that of other Forest Wolves.\nWhat kind of creature was this?\nWas it really a Forest Wolf?\nAnd it went without saying that among these people, the most eye-catching one was indeed Su Ping. At this moment, Su Ping had finally summoned his Pet Beast, instantly drawing the attention of the other students.\nAside from the others, the moment Zhang Guowei and that youth from the Fire King Company laid eyes upon Xiao Qing, the unique color of its fur elicited an involuntary exclamation from them:\n\"A mutated Pet Beast!\"\nClearly, their words finally made everyone understand what this oddly colored Forest Wolf was.\n\"A mutated Pet Beast? I heard that they’re very rare and valuable.\"\n\"That’s not necessarily the case. It depends on the direction of the mutation and whether there is any potential for growth. However, generally speaking, they are definitely more valuable than ordinary Pet Beasts!\"\n\"No wonder Su Ping refused Director Zhang’s recommendation. The value of a mutated Forest Wolf might not be lower than that of a Commander Level Pet Beast, right?\"\nThe exclamations around him were one thing, but what truly left Zhou Shuchen unable to react at this moment was the size of this Forest Wolf.\nThe size of this mutated Forest Wolf was no different from the previous one—did this mean...\nBefore he could ponder further, the pair of twin Beast Tamers had already started urging, \"Could you make way, please.\"\nEveryone then realized and stepped aside, opening up a path to the nearby training arena.\nThe twin brothers were about the same age as the rest of them, but their Realm and level of Beast Taming were a bit higher; they were obviously students from a key Basic Academy within Linzhou.\nThe need for sparring partners ranging from Fifth to Seventh Rank was proof enough of that.\nMoreover, in a certain sense, since the brothers were two Beast Tamers controlling Pet Beasts, compared to sparring Pet Beasts without a Tamer’s enhancement, they also had a significant advantage.\nHowever, Su Ping was unconcerned and likewise looked towards the arena with great interest.\nXiao Qing and the little one, aside from Old Sha, were the only two Forest Wolves that had completed the Heart of Woods cultivation, and they were also rivals that constantly challenged each other.\nBut this time, that they were unexpectedly going to join forces in battle also made Su Ping quite curious.\nHowever, to Su Ping’s surprise, after the twin brothers entered the arena and exchanged glances, the Pet Beasts they summoned were unexpected.\nIt was none other than a pair of Forest Wolves!\nAnd their size was no different from his own Forest Wolves.\n\"Go!\"\nThe brothers hardly hesitated; their two Forest Wolves rapidly charged towards Xiao Qing and the little one, one leading and the other following.\nTheir speed was one thing, but what really piqued Su Ping’s interest was the coordination between the two Forest Wolves.\nClearly, the brothers were not just showing off in front of Miss Yin, the school belle.\nThey truly had some skills.\nThe synergy in the combat of the two Forest Wolves was so captivating that Su Ping couldn’t look away.\nWolf packs are inherently adept at peak teamwork.\nBut with a Tamer’s cultivation, an individual’s strength vastly improved. Hence, this combat method tended to disappear once they became Pet Beasts.\nHowever, these two brothers were different.\nTheir two Forest Wolves, one in front and the other behind, one to the left and the other to the right, coordinated almost perfectly.\nEspecially since Xiao Qing and the little one’s coordination paled in comparison to their opponents, Xiao Qing, unable to quickly join the fight, immediately found itself at a disadvantage!\n\"AWOO!\"\nThe little one’s body grew larger. The accelerated growth had a multiplying effect, boosting its strength and speed, and suddenly the Forest Wolf that had been entangled with it was completely overpowered.\nHowever, the other Forest Wolf had already moved up to take its place.\nThis combinatory attack technique wasn’t any particular Skill, but it often proved more practical than the Skills Pet Beasts usually favored.\nInteresting! Truly interesting.\nSu Ping felt as if he had been captivated by some rare treasure.\nA spark seemed to flash through his mind in that instant. It was just a preliminary idea, though, and to truly perfect it, continuous training would be necessary.\nBut Su Ping felt an indescribable joy in his heart; he was like a parched sponge, eagerly taking in the sight of the combinatory attack technique unfolding before him—crude as it actually was, its coordination was nonetheless perfect.\nThe little one and those rented Forest Wolves had been instructed by Su Ping to prolong the fight as much as possible; after all, people had paid money for training, so battling a bit longer would also ease his conscience.\nUnfortunately, unlike the little one, Xiao Qing didn’t have such a good temper.\nAlthough it didn’t like the little one, the little one was still its rival. Seeing its rival being ganged up on like this, while those two sly Forest Wolves avoided engaging Xiao Qing directly, instead dodging it to prioritize the little one first...\nThis made Xiao Qing very indignant! Did they consider me less of a threat than that other guy?\nThus, Xiao Qing erupted!\n\"AOOW...\"\nEmpowered by the terrifying Heart of the Poison Wood, its Poison Vine Strangulation—already vastly different from the regular Vine Strangling of other Forest Wolves—caused purple, coiling vines to burst from the ground, seemingly condensing out of thin air.\nLike purple vipers, they swiftly coiled around their target.\nTheir speed surpassed even the running speed of these two Forest Wolves, whose own speed had clearly been enhanced!\n\"AOO...\"\nAn excited howl resounded as one of the twins’ Forest Wolves had its paw instantly entwined by the vines.\nIf these were just regular vines, perhaps the Forest Wolf could have freed itself using strength and Skills.\nUnfortunately, these were vines enhanced by the Heart of the Poison Wood.\nThey not only entangled but also delivered a potent, paralyzing poison!\nAs expected, less than three seconds after being entangled, the Forest Wolf, which could still move its feet, suddenly stiffened. After stretching its legs, it toppled with a THUMP onto the dueling platform, under everyone’s astonished gaze.\nNow facing a two-on-one, the remaining Forest Wolf didn’t last more than ten seconds.\nWith Xiao Qing’s deployment of Poison Vine Strangulation, the tables turned rapidly.\nFrom the little one being overwhelmed and on the verge of being eliminated first, they snatched an unexpected victory. From start to finish, the entire exchange took less than thirty seconds!\nThe medical staff hurried onto the platform, picked up the two Forest Wolves, and administered two antidotes before saying to the anxious twin Beast Tamers, \"It’s a bodily paralyzing poison. They just need to rest for a while; there’s no other danger. Don’t worry.\"\nThe twin Beast Tamers finally let out a sigh of relief.\nMeanwhile, the other onlookers who had watched this particular Pet Beast battle from start to finish had incredibly complex expressions.\nA mutated Forest Wolf, and its mutation is the rare Poison Type!\nNo wonder Su Ping wasn’t interested in that Crimson Claw Centipede.\nJust then, the medical staff member brought over the now-awake Crimson Fang Tiger, handing it to Zhou Shuchen, who was completely dumbfounded.\nZhou, the squad leader, looked at Chi Yun in his arms. Although the Crimson Fang Tiger had been unconscious, it was just as indignant about the unfair fight its master had informed it about.Google seaʀᴄh No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nIt had felt its master’s fighting spirit through the Soul Contract. Now fully recovered, the little Crimson Fang Tiger was valiant and eager, ready to fight once more to avenge its master’s honor!\nZhou Shuchen glanced again at the strange, viridian Forest Wolf—whose body was no smaller than the previous wolves and was even capable of controlling those terrifying poison vines—and then at its contemptuous, proud gaze and its smug, disdainful wolf howl.\nZhou, the squad leader, fell silent.\nAnd, as if to rub salt in the wound, Li Shusheng at the side piped up, seemingly afraid others wouldn’t hear, \"Zhou, are you and Su Ping going to continue fighting?\"\nInstantly, all eyes focused on Zhou Shuchen.\nRight, were they still going to fight?",

      "content": "Chapter 34: Chapter 34: Business Knocking at the Door? Zhang Guowei’s Goodwill? (First release, asking for votes)\nEven Su Ping was briefly attracted by the scene but didn’t pay much attention. He didn’t have the leisure to concern himself with such trivial matters right now, instead focusing his gaze on the twin brothers. As his eyes met theirs, the two also looked back at Su Ping, their gazes filled with amazement as they stared at the mutated Forest Wolf.\n\"What an impressive mutated Forest Wolf! To be able to find such a Pet Beast, and seeing you have so many of them, does your family specialize in this?\" one of them asked.\nTheir Pet Beast had been taken for treatment, so the twin brothers currently had nothing to do. When Su Ping looked their way, they started a conversation. It was indeed easier to strike up a conversation since they had the same kind of Pet Beast, the Forest Wolf, were of similar age, and even possessed comparable strength and skills.\n\"Yes, it’s right next door at the Heart of Woods Forest Wolf training center. That’s my family’s business,\" Su Ping confirmed.\nSeeing Su Ping nod, one of the twins introduced himself, \"My name is Zhang Wen, and this is my younger brother Zhang Wu—not the ’wu’ in ’martial arts,’ but the ’wu’ in ’one, two, three, four, five.’\"\nZhang Wu also gave Su Ping a thumbs up. \"Neither Zhang Wen nor I knew that the Heart of Woods next door was a Forest Wolf training center. If we had known, we would have gone to check it out.\"\nSu Ping smiled. \"My name is Su Ping. You guys are pretty amazing too, with such perfectly coordinated combined attack techniques. How did you manage to do that?\"\nAlthough asking such a question might sometimes be seen as forward, Su Ping was genuinely curious.\nThe brothers exchanged a look, and Zhang Wen explained, \"Our Talent is called ’Shared Connection.’ Zhang Wu and I can communicate telepathically, and so can our Pet Beasts. Moreover, ever since we got our Contracted Beasts, we have been training together, and that’s why. But even with that, we couldn’t defeat you!\"\nWith that, Zhang Wen couldn’t help saying, \"It’s no wonder you specialize in training Forest Wolves. It’s impressive enough that the mutated one is so powerful, but even the unmutated ones are formidable. Most importantly, they listen to you so well. Truly remarkable.\"\nSu Ping smiled, not particularly moved by the praise, though the outcome did leave him feeling a bit helpless. Indeed, training a well-coordinated combined attack technique was no easy feat.The source of this content ɪs novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nI just wasn’t sure if the Shared Connection feature from my own Forest Wolf Catalog LV2 had such a capability. But I doubted it, as the primary function of the Shared Connection was to enhance the training of Pet Beasts’ Skills.\nShaking his head, Su Ping wasn’t in a hurry. After all, there was still plenty of time ahead.\nJust then, the brothers glanced at each other again, their curiosity evident as they asked, \"Your training of the Forest Wolf is so impressive, there must be remarkable Breeders at this training center, right? I wonder if there are any services available for a fee? We brothers would also like to develop our Pet Beasts.\"\nSu Ping suddenly snapped back to reality.\nIs this business coming to my door?\nHe replied with a smile, \"I am a Breeder, and there are services available for a fee, but this isn’t the right place to discuss it in detail. If you’re interested, you’re welcome to visit my place when you have the time to talk it over.\"\nThe brothers nodded in unison. \"Great!\"\nHowever, at that moment, a voice suddenly sounded from nearby: \"Su Ping, you’re a Breeder too?\"\nIt wasn’t Zhou Shuchen but the smiling Zhang Guowei. This Director Zhang had completely revised his opinion of this young man, whom he hadn’t taken very seriously before. When he had initially offered him the scythe giant centipede, he had been rejected and hadn’t thought much of him.\nThe Talent ’Pet Beast Home’ mainly revolved around logistical skills. However, it wasn’t just about his Talent; unexpectedly, Su Ping also seemed to have a good relationship with that distinguished Life Ancient Tree Beast Tamer who had just arrived. Moreover, he possessed such an extremely rare mutated Forest Wolf. And he was even a Breeder? Now, I’m truly keen on getting to know Su Ping all over again. After all, we both spent time at the same school, so nominally we have a teacher-student relationship, right?\nGlancing at the smiling Zhang Guowei, Su Ping simply nodded lightly.\nBut Zhang Guowei had already started speaking again. \"Su Ping, becoming a Breeder is not something just anyone can achieve. Having this Talented Ability is a source of pride for our Sixth Middle School. Don’t say your teacher doesn’t take good care of you...\"\nAs he spoke, Zhang Guowei looked at Su Ping but extended his hand towards a young man standing beside him. This young man had shown a change in expression only at the sight of the Life Ancient Tree and Su Ping’s mutated Forest Wolf. At all other times, he maintained an indifferent demeanor towards Su Ping, his classmates, and the Low-level Beast Tamers present who were training and battling. Others, as well as Su Ping, only knew that this person seemed to be with the Fire King Company, but they did not know what exactly he did.\nZhang Guowei spoke again, \"This person here is Jin Cheng, a Breeder with the Fire King Company’s Breeding Department. He is a Junior Breeder formally accredited by the Linzhou Breeder Association, and he has quite remarkable insights into the Cultivation of Pet Beasts, especially beast-type Pet Beasts! You should definitely have a good talk with him about this.\"\nSurprised, Su Ping glanced at the young man, who seemed to be not much older than him.\nA Junior Breeder from the Fire King Company’s Breeding Department? No wonder he acted with such an air. Before Qin Xiaoxue arrived, whenever someone called to inquire, they would always ask about this. That’s why I later did some research online and gained a rough understanding of the Breeder Association’s accreditation process. To have such an accomplishment at his age seemed indeed quite remarkable.\nJin Cheng, noticing Su Ping’s slightly surprised expression, hurriedly extended his hand. \"Classmate Su, I didn’t expect you to be so interested in Pet Beast Cultivation. Rest assured, if there’s anything you don’t understand, you can ask me directly.\"\nHis tone was warm, but Su Ping frowned slightly. However, not wanting to snub a smiling face, he ultimately extended his hand and shook Jin Cheng’s. \"Then I’ll have to thank Breeder Jin for that.\"\nI could see that Jin Cheng wasn’t mocking me like Zhou Shuchen had. He was merely used to looking down on students like us, accustomed to his elevated position—even with my unique background and my mutated Forest Wolf. But in his own area of expertise, Jin Cheng still adopted a mentoring tone with me. This, too, was a kind of goodwill, I suppose.\nAfter all, for an average person, even one who might become a colleague like Zhou Shuchen, Jin Cheng would only make a simple record and formulate a basic training plan based on the battles.\nHowever, the Zhang brothers, Wen and Wu, exchanged glances, skepticism visible in each other’s eyes.\nObviously, if a breeding center like Heart of Woods had a Breeder proficient in this, that would be one thing. But this youngster before us, even younger than we are, claiming to be a Breeder and clearly still a student... it made us reconsider. Pet Beast Cultivation is expensive! A regular family can’t afford to gamble a large sum on an inexperienced and unknown Breeder.\nAfter all, not everyone has money blowing in the way Qin Xiaoxue does. Nor does everyone have Qin Xiaoxue’s astonishing thought process.\nSuch hesitation and distrust are only human.",

      "content": "Chapter 35: Chapter 35: Have you taken the junior breeder qualification exam? (Second update for votes)\nSu Ping noticed the hesitation of the Zhang Family Brothers but didn’t feel the need to explain anything.\nAfter all, he wasn’t short on money at the moment, and once he finished cultivating Qin Xiaoxue’s Woodhead, the operating expenses for the base during this period would be more than enough.\nThe Pet Beast business is just like that: high costs, high profits. You might not make a sale for three years, but one good sale can sustain you for the next three.\nThis line of work was all about making money from powerful Beast Tamers.\nSomeone like Qin Xiaoxue, a top-tier wealthy woman, was precisely Su Ping’s target customer.\nHowever, Jin Cheng seemed to have suddenly opened up. His previous reserve had completely vanished, and he chatted with Su Ping with a smile, saying, \"Speaking of which, Su Ping, if you’re considering becoming a Breeder, are you prepared for the Breeder certification exam?\"\nBreeder certification exam?\nA strange expression briefly crossed Su Ping’s face as he glanced at Breeder Jin, but he still shook his head.\nHe really didn’t need to prepare. Just yesterday, someone had made him a promise.\nThey had agreed to let him bypass the Junior Breeder level, directly granting him an Intermediate Breeder certification.\nEven though that old man had a cunning look and didn’t seem entirely reliable, Su Ping, trusting Qin Xiaoxue, had still given him some of his information.\nLater on, he even learned a bit about the man’s identity.\nSeeing Su Ping shake his head, Jin Cheng immediately smiled. Clearly, this was a domain he was familiar with. This Breeder, Jin Cheng, slapped Su Ping’s shoulder, exuding an air of utmost reliability as he said, \"Brother Su, how about this? I’ll send you some materials for the exam later. For the Junior Breeder certification, you must choose a field you excel in. You also need a precise understanding of various Pet Beast states and must learn how to quickly calm their emotions.\n\"And most importantly, based on your chosen Pet Beast specialization, you must know how to train their skills. You also need to interact with your chosen Pet Beast to meet the exam’s requirements...\"\nJin Cheng rattled on and on, and Su Ping listened very attentively.\nHe hadn’t learned much about the actual content of the exam from his online research. He had only seen many people complaining about the Breeder certification exam. The written test was one thing, but the real challenge lay in the practical part: making close contact with the chosen Pet Beast and meeting exam requirements. These could include calming a raging Pet Beast, pleasing it, or getting it to perform skills to a specific standard. These hands-on assessments prevented many aspirants from passing the Breeder certification.\nFor this reason, the Breeder qualification exam took place almost every month. This was unlike the Beast Tamer exam, which occurred on such a large scale only once every three years. However, the number of people who managed to pass the Breeder exam was far fewer than for the Beast Tamer exam.\nRegardless of whether Jin Cheng wanted to build a closer relationship with him or simply showcase his knowledge, learning such information was never a bad thing.\nZhou Shuchen watched Jin Cheng chattering away, a far cry from the arrogance he had displayed when they first met. The way Jin Cheng treated Su Ping was in stark contrast to how he treated him.\nThis contrast made Zhou Shuchen clench his fists tightly.\nIt’s just because his family is wealthy! If my family had such a strong financial foundation, I would surely do better than Su Ping.\nUnfortunately, at this moment, he truly didn’t dare to step forward and do anything. He hadn’t even dared to continue confronting Su Ping when Li Shu had asked earlier!\nThat mutated Forest Wolf is simply too terrifying. Its growth rate is too fast—an Ordinary Sixth Stage mutated Forest Wolf, and a Poison Attribute mutation at that! How much would this Pet Beast be worth?\nZhou Shuchen had no concept of its value. And how many resources would it take to raise it to an Ordinary Sixth Stage during the contract period? He didn’t know. He could only attribute it all to one reason: Su Ping’s family was wealthy. Not because Su Ping himself was actually that skilled.\nThᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt\nThinking of this, Zhou Shuchen felt a surge of resentment. Why hadn’t he been born into such a good family? Why didn’t he have such good parents? Now, after he’d spent millions from a loan to buy the Crimson Fang Tiger, his parents were constantly nagging at home. Although they hadn’t complained to him directly, it was obvious their complaints were aimed at him. Such parents and such a household were holding back his path as a Beast Tamer!\nSu Ping, standing nearby, was unaware that this small interaction had evoked such profound resentment in Class Leader Zhou. He was still listening to Jin Cheng.\nHe was gaining a deeper understanding of the Breeder profession, which was a very special and one of the most important occupations in this world.\nA Breeder’s abilities weren’t about formulaic cultivation but involved a deep understanding of Pet Beasts, an affinity with their habits, and the various research directions that could emerge under different circumstances. The Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas could bestow upon Su Ping an unrivaled cultivation ability for the Forest Wolf, but it couldn’t directly impart foundational information and theoretical knowledge.\nThese things might sometimes seem useless, but as the saying goes, you only regret not knowing enough when you need the knowledge.\nWatching Su Ping’s attentive demeanor, Jin Cheng nodded inwardly in approval.\nWho wouldn’t want their audience to listen attentively when they speak, occasionally contributing their own insights and follow-up questions? And then, to see the understanding and admiration in their eyes after you answer those questions?\nIf it were just an ordinary graduate—like Zhou Shuchen and his classmates—Jin Cheng wouldn’t even bother speaking to them, even if they were willing to listen. But Su Ping, standing before him, was clearly different. Not to mention that Su Ping managed such a large Pet Beast cultivation base, possessed such a rare mutated Forest Wolf, and was friends with a female Beast Tamer who owned a Monarch Level Life Ancient Tree. All this was enough to show that Su Ping was absolutely different from those others.\nSu Ping’s willingness to listen so earnestly undoubtedly satisfied Jin Cheng’s vanity immensely. With a wave of his hand, he offered, \"Here’s what we’ll do, Su Ping. I’ll give you a phone number later. It belongs to Teacher Zhao, who works at the Breeder Association. He’s an Intermediate Breeder on assignment there and occasionally oversees Breeder exams!\n\"When you call him, just mention I recommended you. You can subtly inquire which of this year’s Junior Breeder exams will feature Forest Wolves for assessment. That way, your chances of passing will be much higher!\"\nSu Ping was startled. Was there such a workaround? But upon reflection, it made sense. After all, it’s people who implement the rules, and where there are people, there can be loopholes.\nHowever, looking at Breeder Jin, Su Ping didn’t refuse the kind gesture. He took out his phone, preparing to add the number of this so-called Teacher Zhao.\nNo sooner had he unlocked his phone than an incoming call appeared on the screen. It wasn’t just anyone; it was Qin Xiaoxue, who had left that morning.\nAfter apologizing to Jin Cheng, Su Ping answered the call.\nThe moment he connected, Qin Xiaoxue’s voice came through from the other end: \"Su Ping, you’re still there, right? Perfect timing! Old Man Liu has come personally to deliver your documents. He’s at your door and hasn’t gone in. I’m bringing him over to find you, okay?\"",

Not only did I arrive at your doorstep and didn’t even know to call you, but even old man Liu didn’t know either! Humph! I told you, it’s because your signboard is too high and your phone number font is too small! It’s not my fault!\"\nListening to Qin Xiaoxue’s extremely quick yet inexplicably proud voice, Su Ping blinked.\nWhat is she doing? Is she trying to make up for me saying her brain isn’t always working right this morning?\nHowever, hearing her say that, could it really be my problem?\n\"If you say so, then it must be. But when you were looking for the place, you should have seen the advertisement, right? I left my phone number on the ad too.\"\n\"I was driving at the time, and it was already a hassle trying to navigate. How could I remember such a long phone number? Then I forgot it when I got to the door.\"\n\"Oh, see? Just as I said...\"\n\"AAAAAH! Do you still want your money or not? I’m the client now!\"\nOn the other end of the phone, Vice President Liu, watching Qin Xiaoxue’s face crumble as she tried to justify herself, had no idea what Miss Qin was discussing with Su Ping.\nBut, come to think of it, he really had never seen Miss Qin like this before.\nAt this thought, Vice President Liu felt a bit emotional. If that kid really could handle this Miss Qin, that would be truly remarkable.\nHowever, he quickly shook his head.\nQin Erlong is one thing, but that person from Magic Capital... how could they be so easily handled?\nNevertheless, these matters had nothing to do with him. His current task was to deliver Su Ping’s Intermediate Breeder certificate to him as soon as possible, and that would suffice.\nWith this in mind, he quickened his pace to keep up with Qin Xiaoxue’s steps.\nOn the other side, after hanging up the phone, Su Ping couldn’t help but laugh and shake his head.\nBefore he could dwell on Qin Xiaoxue’s angry yet helpless expression, Jin Cheng approached him again.The source of this content ɪs NovᴇlFirenᴇt\nAfter glancing at this Breeder, Su Ping didn’t refuse. He saved the phone number of the Intermediate Breeder named Zhao Huaihai into his contacts. Then, he continued to ask, \"By the way, what are the requirements for the Intermediate Breeder assessment?\"\nThis question made Jin Cheng pause slightly.\nYou kid, you haven’t even passed the Junior Breeder assessment, have you? You want to run before you’ve learned to walk?\nHowever, Su Ping was clearly out of the ordinary, so Jin Cheng nodded and said, \"That’s very difficult. It’s not only a test of a Breeder’s experience and skills, but it also requires mastering Skill Cultivation specific to corresponding Pet Beasts. Moreover, the success rate for Cultivation Skills cannot be below fifty percent. This is the most rigid requirement.\"\n\"It’s also the most difficult part. I’m best at Crimson Fang Tiger cultivation, but I’ve never learned the method for them to acquire skills, so I’ve never been able to attempt the Intermediate Breeder assessment.\"\nSu Ping raised an eyebrow. \"So, how does a Breeder learn and acquire these kinds of Skill Cultivation methods?\"\nGlancing at Su Ping, Jin Cheng said with some emotion, \"It’s simple. Either you research and develop it yourself—though achieving that is incredibly difficult, and those who do have a high chance of becoming a Senior Breeder!\"\n\"Alternatively, you can pay a high price to purchase some Magic Potion formulas and use them to increase the cultivation success rate. However, the price of each skill-learning Magic Potion formula is unimaginable!\"\n\"Finally, you can become an apprentice. You can go to some Intermediate or Senior Breeders to apprentice under them and learn their cultivation methods. However, this is also very difficult. After becoming a Breeder, half or even more of your earnings must be given to your master for their teachings. And without your master’s permission, you cannot pass on the knowledge to others...\"\nAs he said this, Jin Cheng’s gaze seemed a bit lost, but it quickly firmed with determination. \"Of course, I’m with Fire King Company now. Here at Fire King Company, as long as my performance meets the standards, I’ve worked for ten years, and I complete certain company targets, I can also apply to learn some Skill Cultivation techniques!\"\nSpeaking of this, Jin Cheng glanced at Su Ping. \"Su Ping, although Fire King Company primarily deals with fire-attribute Pet Beasts, resources, and items as its main business, its power in Linzhou City is undeniable, as you surely know. It even has a certain influence in Jianghai Province!\"\n\"If you want to join Fire King Company, it’s not impossible. With the company’s backing, becoming an Intermediate Breeder in the future probably wouldn’t be too difficult.\"\nSu Ping smiled. \"I don’t have any such plans for now. If I need to in the future, I’ll definitely find you, Brother Jin.\"\nIt had to be said, after chatting for a bit, Jin Cheng had given him a pretty good impression.\nAlthough he was somewhat arrogant towards others, he answered all of Su Ping’s questions without holding anything back.\nThis was especially true for the basic information about Breeders, which was very helpful and significant for Su Ping, allowing him to gain a deeper understanding of what being a Breeder entailed.\nThe differences between Breeders are vast.\nPutting other things aside, just the fact that they specialize in cultivating different Pet Beasts and excel in different fields and directions already creates enormous differences.\nAnd it was at this moment, at the end of Su Ping’s gaze, that two familiar figures finally appeared.\nQin Xiaoxue and Vice President Liu arrived.\nThe former was as energetic and hurried as ever; Su Ping had no idea what she was busy with all day.\nBut then again, it’s normal for a rich woman to be busy.\nJin Cheng followed Su Ping’s gaze. Of course, he recognized at a glance that the woman in sunglasses at the front was the mysterious Beast Tamer who had just summoned the Life Ancient Tree.\nHowever, at this moment, Jin Cheng frowned slightly and turned his attention to another figure.\nThis balding old man... he looks somewhat familiar, doesn’t he?\nJin Cheng saw Su Ping walk over. He naturally wouldn’t be so tactless as to butt in, but his gaze remained fixed on the balding elder, and he sank into thought.\nHe was quite confident in his memory. Jin Cheng was certain he had definitely seen this old man somewhere before.\nWhere had I seen him before?\nJin Cheng scratched his head, momentarily perplexed.\nCould I have misremembered?\nJin Cheng frowned. However, before he could think further, Su Ping, who had walked up to them, greeted President Liu with a smile, \"President Liu, hello. You could have just called me, and I would have gone to the Breeder Association myself. It’s too much trouble for you to make another trip.\"\nPresident Liu?\nJin Cheng blinked. He looked again at the bald, smiling old man, and the image slowly merged with a fleeting glimpse from his memory.\nIt was like a flash of lightning streaking through his mind.\nBefore he could react, the figure that had once been so lofty in his memory spoke with an extremely amiable and smiling expression, \"How could that be acceptable? I made a promise. Otherwise, Miss Qin might accuse me of not keeping my word, right?\"\n\"But it’s just you, Little Su, who doesn’t seem to care much about this Intermediate Breeder certificate. If it were anyone else, they’d probably be incredibly anxious by now, hahaha.\"\nSu Ping also smiled.\nHowever, at this moment, none of them noticed Jin Cheng standing not far behind Su Ping, his expression numb and dumbfounded, as if he’d been struck by lightning.",

      "content": "Chapter 37: Chapter 37 He is the Best Forest Wolf Breeder! (Four more for votes)\nAn Intermediate Breeder Certification?\nVice President Liu?\nSu Ping?\nIntermediate Breeder Certification? Vice President Liu? Su Ping?\nTo Jin Cheng, these three terms seemed utterly unrelated, like apples and oranges.\nJust ten minutes earlier, Su Ping had kindly inquired about the assessments for the Junior Breeder certification. At the same time, he didn’t even seem to know how to begin approaching the subject.\nHowever, ten minutes later, Jin Cheng witnessed such a scene.\nAh, so that’s who this bald old man is!\nHe had once attended a class at the Breeder Association, and this very man had been the lecturer. He was one of the few High-Level Beastmasters in Jianghai Province and, concurrently, a specialized Breeder for wolf-type Pet Beasts.\nNote, wolf-type, not just Forest Wolves. The category of wolf-type Pet Beasts included not only the Forest Wolf but also more basic ones like the Sand Wolf and Snow Wolf, among other varieties.\nThe fact that he could become a specialized Senior Breeder for wolf-types, needless to say, made him far more remarkable than an ordinary Senior Breeder.\nSo, this man was not just a Senior Breeder but also the current Vice President of the Jianghai Province Breeders Association. In Jianghai Province, describing him as ’high-ranking and powerful’ was by no means an exaggeration.\nPreviously, Jin Cheng had only heard him lecture some Junior Breeders, and his courses weren’t something just any Breeder could get into.\nYet now, Vice President Liu, the Senior Breeder, had appeared right here.\nHe appeared before Su Ping, and what did he say? He had come in person to present Su Ping with an Intermediate Breeder Certification?\nIs that even reasonable?\nFor a moment, Jin Cheng was bewildered.\nI don’t know if Su Ping’s status is so significant that it could make Vice President Liu ignore the Breeder Association’s regulations and pull strings like this, or if Su Ping, this little rascal, has been feigning weakness to fool me all this time!\nWith a look of grievance, Jin Cheng turned his eyes towards Su Ping.\nFeeling his gaze, Su Ping intuitively looked back and met Jin Cheng’s reproachful eyes.\nHe certainly understood why and merely smiled, turning to Vice President Liu beside him. \"Old Liu, this is Breeder Jin Cheng from the Breeder Association. Although he’s only a Junior Breeder, he has a solid grasp of theory. I’ve just had a very enlightening conversation with him.\"\n\"Oh?\"\nVice President Liu turned a beaming gaze toward an even more bewildered Jin Cheng. The latter instantly stood bolt upright, his face flushed with excitement, then, like a rigid puppet, he bowed deeply. \"Hello, Teacher Liu! I attended your course on ’The Obedience of Wolf-Type Pet Beasts and the Breeder’s Guidance towards Wolf King’ at the beginning of the year.\"\nVice President Liu’s expression didn’t change. He had lectured many times. The Breeder Association regularly had Intermediate Breeders and the two Vice Presidents conduct courses for Junior Breeders. Each session was attended by several hundred, sometimes nearly a thousand people. Countless Breeders even came from other cities in Jianghai Province—how could he remember them all?\nHowever, thanks to Su Ping’s introduction, Old Liu feigned a scrutinizing look at Jin Cheng, then nodded thoughtfully. \"I see. I do have some impression of you. Not bad.\"\nIn the entirety of Linzhou City, how many Junior Breeders could earn such a ’not bad’ from him?\nInstantly, Jin Cheng felt thrilled, as if he had just taken a stimulant, and quickly responded, \"Yes! I’ll continue to work hard!\"\nVice President Liu shifted his attention from Jin Cheng back to Su Ping, continuing with a smile, \"I’ve delivered the item. Su Ping, you’re now a registered Intermediate Level Forest Wolf Specialized Breeder with the Jianghai Province Breeders Association. Your breeding base and the professional skill training information for Heart of Woods have also been recorded with the Breeder Association. This is far more effective than any advertisement. If you make money, kid, don’t forget to treat this old man to a meal! Of course, I believe in your talent and abilities. This isn’t the end for you. Keep it up.\"\nSu Ping also nodded. \"Thank you for your compliments and help. I will continue to work hard.\"\nVice President Liu was naturally assured. \"In that case, I have some other matters to attend to, so I won’t stay with you young people any longer. However, regarding the bet you made with Xiao Sun, make sure to have me witness it when the time comes. I’m really looking forward to it!\"\n\"Yes! Rest assured, we will definitely not forget to have you as a witness then.\"\nHaving received a satisfactory response, Vice President Liu turned to Qin Xiaoxue, whose attention was not on him but fixed on the Xiao Qing that Su Ping hadn’t put away. \"Miss Qin, I’ll take my leave then.\"\nQin Xiaoxue waved her hand impatiently, her gaze not even shifting.\nVice President Liu didn’t mind. He smiled, nodded towards Jin Cheng as well—who looked back astonished—and then finally turned to leave.\nPreviously, Su Ping had given him the impression of being young and brash. This time, however, Vice President Liu discovered that this young fellow also had a gentle and modest side.\nNot bad, not bad at all.\nHowever, at this moment, another person present was not feeling so lighthearted. Jin Cheng watched Su Ping, who had just opened the brown paper bag in his hands, with complex emotions.\nThe object taken out of the brown paper bag was none other than a certificate bearing Su Ping’s photo and a blue badge representing the Breeder Association.\nBlue, in contrast to his white one, represented an Intermediate Breeder.\nIt was also one of Jin Cheng’s greatest dreams.\nYet, his greatest dream was now clutched in the hands of this brat before him, who was scrutinizing it while muttering discontentedly, \"That’s it? Isn’t this just made of ordinary metal? They couldn’t even bother to use some high-quality metallic resources to craft it. There’s no sense of honor or ceremony at all!\"\nSeeing this brat complaining even after getting a good deal, Jin Cheng almost couldn’t resist punching him.\nI can’t even tell if this guy is showing off or genuinely complaining.\nʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nBut the certificate and badge represented so much. So much, in fact, that he didn’t even know what to say to this young man who had just been chatting so casually with him.\nEarlier, when Jin Cheng and Su Ping had been discussing Breeder matters, there weren’t many people around them. Zhou Shuchen had already resumed battling on the stage with some other classmates he was on good terms with, and Zhang Guowei hadn’t pried too much into their affairs.\nSo, although many had seen a bald elder approach Su Ping, not many knew exactly what had transpired, except for two people.\nThese two were none other than the Zhang Family Brothers, Zhang Wen and Zhang Wu, who had been waiting for their Pet Beasts to recover.\nThe Zhang Family Brothers, being Forest Wolf Beast Tamers themselves, could naturally sense the strength of Xiao Qing and Little One. Upon hearing that Su Ping was from Heart of Woods, the facility next door that specialized in training Forest Wolves, they had wanted to visit. However, after Jin Cheng told them Su Ping wasn’t even an ordinary Breeder, they began to have doubts.\nNow, the situation had changed so quickly. The elderly man who had appeared out of nowhere had said some other confusing things. Besides, as outsiders, they hadn’t felt it was proper to get too close to listen. It left the brothers uncertain about what to do.\nSeizing the opportunity, Zhang Wen approached Jin Cheng and asked quietly, \"Excuse me, Senior Breeder, is Su Ping’s breeding level any good? My brother and I are thinking of finding a training facility to improve our skills, but we haven’t decided yet.\"\nThis question snapped Jin Cheng back to reality. He looked at the retreating figure of the young Beast Tamer, who was being led away by Qin Xiaoxue to squat and chat in front of the mutated Forest Wolf. Jin Cheng’s gaze became extremely complicated.\nHe recalled Vice President Liu’s words.\nThe Heart of Woods’ Forest Wolf skill cultivation? No wonder he could become an Intermediate Breeder! And an Intermediate Breeder who received his certification personally from President Liu, no less! I know all too well what the skills from Heart of Woods represent. If I, Jin Cheng, were the Breeder who had mastered the cultivation of the Crimson Fang Tiger’s ’Heart of Fire’ skill, I’d be revered like an ancestor at Fire King Company!\nSuddenly, looking at the Zhang Family Brothers who were asking with nervous curiosity, Jin Cheng finally said gravely, \"Him? He might be the best Forest Wolf Breeder in Linzhou, or even all of Jianghai Province.\"",

(First update, please vote)\nBreeder Association.\nCompared to the Beast Master Association, the Breeder Association’s location was slightly off-center, not in the middle of the city, but it occupied a larger area. Moreover, besides buildings, there was also a vast experimental area. Beyond that, the most bustling area was undoubtedly the reception hall up front. This hall was so spacious it was almost as big as a typical airport terminal. After all, Linzhou is the capital city of Jianghai Province and one of the core cities in the southeast region. Here, numerous Breeders of all levels came to learn, and various Beast Tamers also came to conduct their affairs and look for compatible Breeders for collaboration. At the same time, the Breeder Association was also the largest Advanced Pet Beast sales and training facility. Many Intermediate and Senior Breeders held positions here, and within the association, they could have a laboratory of their own. This place represented the Pet Beast breeding center of Linzhou and was one of its most important buildings and locations. Its importance was clear.\nToday was no exception.\nIn the lively hall, people bustled about. Many Beast Tamers were at the windows, checking information on Breeders specializing in certain Pet Beasts and trying to get in touch. Others, guided by staff, were entering the various training facilities behind, looking for suitable Pet Beasts.\nHowever, at this moment, a broadcast resonated across the vast hall. The content was quite simple, yet it made everyone turn their ears to listen closely, because the broadcast began with a very distinctive piece of music. As expected, after the music came the exclusive message:\n\"Congratulations to Su Ping from the Heart of Woods base for becoming the 932nd Intermediate Breeder registered with the Jianghai Provincial Branch of the Breeder Association. Intermediate Breeder Su Ping specializes in Forest Wolf breeding...\"\nAs the broadcast sounded, the largest LED screen in the reception hall also displayed images, providing information about the Heart of Woods. For a moment, envy filled the eyes of many Breeders. Becoming an Intermediate Breeder was a dream for so many. However, this message soon left many people completely stunned. As the images and broadcast continued, the specific details about this newly promoted Intermediate Breeder became known:\n\"What the hell? An eighteen-year-old Intermediate Breeder? Isn’t he just fresh out of the Basic Academy?\"\n\"Could there be some foul play? I’ve been assessed for so many years and still haven’t passed the Junior Breeder assessment. How can a little brat pass the Intermediate Breeder assessment?\"\n\"What’s so impossible about it? Breeders aren’t like Beast Tamers, who can only become one after awakening their Talent. Haven’t you seen? His family runs a breeding base. He’s been exposed to it since childhood, and with Talent, it’s normal! But that Cultivation Skill...\"\n\"Heart of Woods! That’s quite interesting...\"\nInstantly, the entire hall was abuzz with discussion. Almost everyone knew that in the outskirts of Linzhou City, a special Pet Beast Breeding Base had emerged, along with such a young Intermediate Breeder. Moreover, his Cultivation Skill was the rare Heart of Woods. Although many held doubts, the endorsement from the Breeder Association undeniably sparked great interest in this unknown and special place. After all, Linzhou City was known as the largest origin place of Wood Element Pet Beasts in the Dragon Nation, and the Forest Wolf was one of its representatives. For a time, Su Ping’s name was on everyone’s lips.\nAt this moment, the Genius Breeder recognized by the Breeder Association, Su Ping, dragged his exhausted body home after six o’clock in the evening. After returning the equally drained Forest Wolves, some of whom were still nursing unhealed wounds, to the forest, he finally heaved a sigh of relief as he collapsed onto the sofa.\nQin Xiaoxue, who was nearby, shook her head. \"I really don’t get you. The rental fees you earn in a day are so meager. Is it really worth pushing yourself this hard? Or is your physical condition just too poor, like some delicate puppy?\"\nSu Ping was too tired to even retort to Miss Qin’s remarks and merely shot her a glance.\nShe has no idea.\nAfter all, since her return, she had only been amusing herself with her Xiao Qing. But when had he, Su, the great Breeder, had a moment’s rest all day? Commanding all the rented Forest Wolves, coordinating them, attending to the injured ones, and ensuring no Forest Wolf disobeyed his commands—he hadn’t stopped for a single moment. Besides, this job truly wasn’t something an ordinary person could handle.\nFortunately, there were rewards. If nothing else, of the sixteen Forest Wolves, a full three had experienced breakthroughs in their Skill Levels today!\nThinking of the astonished looks from the Beast Tamers he had battled,\na smile curled at the corner of Su Ping’s mouth.\nThat’s right, just within a single day, three Forest Wolves had their Skills break through. Although all of them had merely progressed from Beginner to Proficiency—the most basic Level—it was still enough to prove that in such combat, the improvement and breakthrough of Skill Levels were indeed swift. That was the very essence of practical combat.\nHowever, engaging in such battles while also renting out Pet Beasts was indeed too taxing. So much so that Su Ping no longer had the energy to supervise the Self-Healing Skill training in the evening.\nAt this thought, he began to feel as though the effort might not be worth the gains.\nHe shook his head helplessly.\nEven though it’s not ideal,\nSu Ping resolved,\nthis Pet Beast rental business will either have to wait until I can hire people to manage it without my direct involvement, or I’ll have to cut back on such arduous tasks in the future.\nɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nIn the past, Su Ping chose to rent Pet Beasts from Uncle Guan for actual combat training instead of having his own Forest Wolves fight each other. This was not only to hone their ability to face other Pet Beasts in battle; a major reason also involved medical and venue considerations. At Yun Tian’s place, there were Earth Element Pet Beasts specifically responsible for repairing the venue after battles. Without them, just dealing with that would have been exceedingly difficult.\nNow, Su Ping began to think.\nPerhaps I should reverse my strategy. I could rent some Pet Beasts to serve as my sparring partners, along with Beast Tamers whose Pet Beasts can restore the venues. At least then I wouldn’t be so drained that I have no energy for anything else. It’s just a matter of spending some money, right? Although I’m short on money now, that doesn’t mean I will be in the future. Old Liu sounded so confident. Surely he can introduce some business to me, right? If I could secure another hefty payment like that last one, perhaps I could then consider buying some different types of Pet Beasts and fully explore the potential Abilities of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas.\nAs Su Ping was lost in these delightful fantasies, Qin Xiaoxue suddenly spoke up, \"I’ve got something to tell you. Aside from renting Pet Beasts, has that Manager Guan been asking you for anything else recently?\"\nHmm?\nSu Ping raised his eyebrows, turning to look at the serious Qin Xiaoxue.",

The deed to the Yuntian Resort Pet Beast Combat Vacation Village is my family’s, and Uncle Guan has always wanted to buy it.\"\nSu Ping straightened up, not hiding anything. After spending some time with Qin Xiaoxue, he had come to understand her better. Although this young lady had a fiery temper, she didn’t resort to many underhanded tricks.\nAt this point, Su Ping even made a hand gesture indicating a number. \"He even offered this much.\"\nQin Xiaoxue glanced at it. \"I advise you not to sell it! Don’t sell it, no matter how much they offer!\"Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nLooking at Qin Xiaoxue’s serious expression, Su Ping was taken aback, then chuckled. \"Am I stupid? Of course, I’m not going to sell!\"\nThis time, it was Qin Xiaoxue’s turn to be startled. Seeing Su Ping’s demeanor, she looked surprised. \"What, do you also know something about the inside story?\"\nBut Su Ping shook his head. \"I don’t know why, but it’s not hard to guess. When I was still in school, Manager Guan mentioned wanting to buy our family’s deed to my dad a few times. My old man might not have been the most reliable, but he knew what was important when it came to certain things. It’s only been a few months since my dad passed away, and I took over all matters for Heart of Woods. How many times has Manager Guan come knocking? Including today, in less than ten days, he’s brought this up with me no less than three times. Ostensibly, he’s renting those few Forest Wolves of mine, but in reality, every time he brings up buying the deed, offering not just money but also many other arguments. I don’t know what he’s so anxious about, but no one in this world is a fool; no one makes a losing deal. His price is fair, and his investment is indeed substantial, so buying the deed might seem reasonable. Still, something doesn’t feel right to me.\"\nThose were Su Ping’s true thoughts. If it were someone like Zhou Shuchen or Li Shu, fresh graduates faced with such large sums of money and seemingly reasonable motivations, they might have jumped at such a good opportunity.\nBut unfortunately, Su Ping wasn’t one of them.\nAn overly eager buyer never means a good deal for the seller.\nSu Ping believed he understood this principle, and he figured Uncle Guan understood it too. The latter was likely just taking advantage of his youth and lack of social experience, and hadn’t resorted to harsher methods yet.\nHowever, he understood this, but how had Qin Xiaoxue guessed? Judging by her tone, it seemed she knew even more than he did.\nSo, he looked at Qin Xiaoxue, whose eyes were filled with a complex expression. \"Sister Qin, do you perhaps know some insider information?\"\nQin Xiaoxue’s complex look faded. She glanced at this composed young man, who didn’t seem like a typical fresh graduate, and said irritably, \"Now you remember to call me sister?\"\nAfter glaring fiercely at Su Ping, Qin Xiaoxue continued, \"My grandfather hasn’t been able to find out the exact details, but do you know who’s behind Yuntian Resort?\"\n\"Who?\" Su Ping asked eagerly, not minding her attempt to build suspense.\n\"Tianyun Group. Have you heard of it?\"\n\"HISS!\" Su Ping drew a sharp breath.\nYuntian Resort... Tianyun Group...\nThe names were just reversed, but he’d never connected them before. The reason was simple: the disparity between them was too vast.\nPerhaps Yuntian Resort had some strength, but compared to Tianyun Group, it was insignificant. Even the Fire King Company, where Jin Cheng was and where Zhou Shuchen had signed the contract earlier that day, was leagues behind Tianyun Group in Jianghai Province.\nThis was a true local behemoth in Jianghai Province. Its industries were wide-ranging, encompassing Pet Beast real estate, medical services, conventional resource sales, and various other civilian sectors. It even wielded a certain degree of influence in the eastern part of the Dragon Nation.\nCould such a behemoth truly be connected to that middle-aged manager next door, the one whose smile reminded him of a chrysanthemum?\nHowever, Su Ping would never doubt Qin Xiaoxue’s words.\nIn other words, Tianyun Group was behind Manager Guan. They were the ones who truly wanted to buy his family’s land deed!\nAlthough Pet Beast real estate was indeed one of Tianyun Group’s main businesses, Su Ping found it hard to believe that, under normal circumstances, they would invest so heavily in this suburban location.\nEspecially since Qin Xiaoxue then added, \"Also, a few days ago, I was next door at your place. After that Manager Guan returned from your place, he reported your answer to someone. And that someone was the Chairwoman of Tianyun Group: Dong Muyun.\"\nDong Muyun.\nThe name wasn’t entirely unfamiliar to Su Ping; he occasionally heard it mentioned on television news. But he had never actually seen her.\nHearing Qin Xiaoxue’s words, Su Ping frowned again.\nTianyun Group was enormous. If it were just one of their projects leading them to buy his family’s land deed, that would be somewhat normal. But what if the Chairwoman herself was involved? What if she was personally inquiring about it?\nSu Ping quickly asked, \"If she really wants it, there must be many ways she could force me to sell the land, right?\"\nAlthough he didn’t want to sell, such powerful figures naturally had numerous resources. They could even potentially leverage official power to enforce a compulsory sale.\nQin Xiaoxue nodded. \"That’s exactly the point. From beginning to end, no word has gotten out. My grandfather doesn’t know anything, and perhaps even within Tianyun Group, not many are aware. I’ve been using my connections to investigate these past few days but haven’t found anything concrete. They’ve kept it under wraps, and their reluctance to use forceful measures might also stem from this.\"\nHaving said that, Qin Xiaoxue let out a sigh. \"So, I’m just giving you a heads-up. There’s something fishy about this. You should be careful.\"\n\"Thank you.\" This time, Su Ping’s thanks were sincere. Although he had suspected there was more to the situation, he hadn’t realized the full extent of the implications.\nIn response to his gratitude, Qin Xiaoxue seemed a bit embarrassed. She waved her hand and said hurriedly, \"Oh, it’s nothing. Besides, Woodhead is here with you, right? I’m still counting on you to help Woodhead improve further, beyond just Self-Healing. Anyway, it’s getting late. I’m heading back.\"\nWatching Qin Xiaoxue’s hurried departure, Su Ping glanced at the time. It was only six o’clock. How was it late?\nBut he didn’t dwell on it. He opened his computer and typed ’Tianyun Group’ and ’Dong Muyun’ into the search bar.\n’Tianyun Group is a modernized...’\nHe promptly closed the generic company introduction and focused on Dong Muyun. Even online, there wasn’t much information available on her; there was only a single side-profile photo.\nIn the photo, the woman wore sportswear and seemed to be jogging. It was clear she had a slender yet curvaceous figure.\nBut Su Ping wasn’t concerned with that. Instead, he focused on her biography.\nOther details aside, what captured Su Ping’s attention was the information about her rumored Pet Beasts. The information indicated that Dong Muyun was a Beast Tamer of at least Monarch Level.\nFurthermore, her main Pet was a unique creature known as the Sky-Swimming Fish.\nWhile this Pet Beast wasn’t particularly noted for its combat prowess, one of its attributes was especially noteworthy: It was a rare space-attribute Pet Beast!\nStaring at the information about Dong Muyun on the screen, Su Ping fell into deep thought.",

Since someone had arrived without prior notice, he could only drag his exhausted body to open the door.\nTwo familiar figures arrived as dusk settled.\nIt was none other than the Zhang Family Brothers, the twins he’d met during the day.\n\"It’s you guys, please come in!\"\nAlthough still very tired, Su Ping mustered his energy and led the visiting guests into the living room.\n\"I don’t have much to offer for drinks. Please make do with this.\"\nSu Ping got two bottles of Coke.\nHe did have some tea and a drink-making machine, but he truly lacked the energy to properly host them at the moment.\nClearly, the brothers hadn’t come for such trivial matters. After a quick ’thank you’ from the older brother, Zhang Wen, he promptly asked,\n\"Um...\"\n\"Just call me Su Ping.\"\nZhang Wen then blurted out,\n\"Su Ping, what specific services do you offer for Forest Wolf training? You do have a business license and all that, right?\"\nAlthough Jin Cheng, who seemed quite knowledgeable, had given Su Ping extremely high praise during the day, the brothers still needed to see for themselves before they could be certain.\nAfter all, Pet Beast Cultivation is no small matter.\nBesides the huge expense, what’s most important is that it could affect their future!\nSo, the caution displayed by the Zhang Family Brothers was understandable.\nSu Ping simply smiled,\n\"Don’t worry. If your Pet Beast dies due to my Cultivation methods, you won’t need to sue me. I’ll turn myself in.\"\nWith that, Su Ping’s expression turned a bit more serious,\n\"However, the Cultivation I offer here is different from other places. The skill I cultivate is the Wood Element’s rare skill, ’Heart of Woods.’ You should understand the value and significance of the Heart of Woods.\n\"Therefore, the cost for successfully cultivating this skill in one Pet Beast is 4,000,000. If it’s not successful, the materials fee is 1,000,000. Aside from that, I also offer skill level enhancement Cultivation, but I don’t have time to take on that service at the moment.\n\"In a while, if you come back, I’ll also offer Cultivation for the Forest Wolf’s Accelerated Casting, but I haven’t decided on the specific pricing yet. If you’re the first to try it out then, I’ll give you a discount.\"\nSu Ping said this as if he were offering them a great bargain.\nThat’s right, Su Ping raised his prices!\nHaving experienced the recent events, Su Ping had gained a deeper understanding of his own abilities!\nJust consider the Heart of Woods skill! Sun Chaoju dared to openly ask for 3,000,000 for Accelerated Casting, non-refundable whether successful or not. Compared to him, I’m much more conscientious.\nFor the service this ability warranted, the price was actually a bit low.\nIf it really succeeds, its value is beyond monetary measure.\nThis is the value of knowledge in the Beastmaster Society!\nBesides, things are different now than they were a few days ago!\nThe current Su Ping is a genuine Intermediate Level Breeder officially registered with the Breeder Association!\nWith this price, who knows how it might change in the future.\nHowever, it was clear that the Zhang Family Brothers standing before him were not fools with deep pockets like Qin Xiaoxue. Even though it was apparent that their family wasn’t short of money, they certainly weren’t the sort to casually throw away millions.\nThe two exchanged a troubled look. After a moment of contemplation, the elder brother, Zhang Wen, spoke up,\n\"Su Ping, can’t you give us a little discount?\"\nThe recently graduated young man was clearly not skilled at haggling; his cheeks even flushed a bit after he spoke.\nBut Su Ping shook his head,\n\"Sorry, but I also bear risks.\"\nSeeing Su Ping’s firm stance, the brothers said,\n\"How about this, can we discuss it with our family and give you an answer in a few days?\"\nSu Ping smiled,\n\"Of course. I wouldn’t dream of forcing a sale.\"\nRelieved, the brothers left.\nMeanwhile, Su Ping sank into thought. It wasn’t about the discount. In fact, even if the two of them paid outright, Su Ping wouldn’t be able to cultivate the Heart of Woods for their Forest Wolf yet.\nThe resources and materials he had purchased were still in transit and would take some time to arrive.\nSu Ping was deep in contemplation. He had never thought of just being satisfied with the status quo. Becoming a Breeder was naturally a goal, but not primarily for making money. After all, no matter how amazing a Breeder or how respected a Breeding Master, they couldn’t compare to a true high-level Beast Tamer.\nOnly mastering extraordinary taming powers was Su Ping’s true pursuit and dream.\nHis Cultivation ability was a means to indirectly enhance his own strength.\nThe appearance of the Zhang Family Brothers was neither the first nor would it be the last. It was foreseeable that as his abilities and reputation grew, there would be an endless stream of customers. He didn’t want to lose the time he had to train his own Pet Beasts.\nTʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nSo, should he find some assistants in the future or, like other Pet Beast Breeding Bases, set up a complete assembly line?\nBlinking, Su Ping decided it would be necessary in the future.\nIt wasn’t just about the money. At a Pet Beast Breeding Base, he would have the chance to interact with many Pet Beasts at any time. This could help the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas level up faster, thereby accelerating his own strength improvement.\nAs for money, it would be earned regardless.\nHis Cultivation skills were certainly much stronger than those of the deceiving Breeders on the market, right?\nShaking his head, Su Ping dragged his tired body and called the Forest Wolves back to him.\nTheir Self-Healing training couldn’t stop.\nHowever, the Forest Wolves that had fought during the day were allowed to rest properly. Only those few that hadn’t participated would join today’s training.\nAfter arranging all this, Su Ping resumed pondering the issues he had been considering.\nHowever, after only a short while, Su Ping, who hadn’t rested well to begin with, succumbed to his exhaustion and slowly drifted into a deep sleep.\nIn front of the woods, some of the Forest Wolves rested, while others spontaneously joined the training.\nThus, the rest of the vast Heart of Woods Pet Beast Breeding Base was deserted.\nAnd at that moment, just behind the Heart of Woods’ forest, at the boundary adjoining Yuntian Resort and the banks of the Lingxi River, a faint ripple slowly materialized in the darkness of the night.\nThis was a unique spatial fluctuation.\nThen, from within this subtle ripple, a tiny figure appeared seemingly out of nowhere. It tilted its head, looking around with some confusion.\nHowever, it quickly concealed its form and vanished once more.\nNot long after, Old Sha, who had been watching the Forest Wolves train in front of the woods, seemed to stiffen. He looked towards the Lingxi River, sniffed the air, and a puzzled expression crossed his face.",

(Four Updates)\nAn alluring yet indifferent gaze overlooked the building below, where the figure stood as if she rightfully belonged high above.\nHowever, her unusually cold expression, even more so than on other days, made it clear that this queen-like presence was not in a good mood.\nIndeed, this was the case.\nDong Muyun glanced at Manager Guan, who stood there constantly wiping sweat from his brow, and her red lips parted as she said indifferently, \"You offered that price, and the kid still disagreed? And now, he might have sensed something, to the point that he has even stopped the rentals?\"\nHer voice was calm, yet it made the beads of sweat on Manager Guan’s forehead grow more profuse. He quickly said, \"It’s not necessarily that he has sensed anything. Su Ping isn’t short of money now. He has become an Intermediate Breeder and, in this short period, seems to have invented the cultivation technique for the Forest Wolf’s Heart of Woods. It’s now registered with the Breeder Association.\"\nAs he said this, Manager Guan even felt a touch of admiration. He had been here for several years and had considerable contact with the Su Family father and son. He naturally knew what the Heart of Woods had been like before.\nAnd now, Su Ping had inexplicably become an Intermediate Breeder. Moreover, since that morning, a constant stream of people had been coming and going. With a little inquiry, he discovered that this kid was really about to take off!\nHowever, it was clear that these words made Dong Muyun slowly turn her head and look at him calmly. \"Manager Guan Qianshan,\" she stated, \"from now on, you will no longer be the manager of Yuntian Resort. The company has a construction and development plan for an aquatic Pet Beast breeding base on Crescent Island. You are to go there and supervise the work.\"\nHer placid words made Manager Guan’s face turn pale.Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\nCrescent Island was a small island in Jianghai Province, undoubtedly a desolate place.\nIs this banishment?\nhe thought.However, having come to report, he was mentally prepared. Instead, he suddenly felt much more relaxed and nodded. \"Yes!\"\nManager Guan had a very good relationship with the Su Family father and son. He could guess that the chairman’s persistent desire to buy the land deed was for other reasons. This feeling had always made Manager Guan feel guilty, as if he were deceiving a child. Now, being suddenly banished, he felt an unprecedented sense of relief in his heart.\n\"Take the bus while it’s still running and hand over your duties to the new manager today,\" Dong Muyun said.\nWatching him leave, Dong Muyun’s impassive gaze showed no change.\nTianyun was a small kingdom, and she was its sole queen.\nWith a thought, a light flashed in the spacious living room. A silver, strange fish, about the size of a dolphin, appeared in the air.\n\"KREE... KREE...\"\nA peculiar cry sounded. Only then did Dong Muyun reveal a hint of a smile, but it vanished quickly, and her brow furrowed. \"The spatial fluctuations are becoming more intense? To the point that even some high-level Pet Beasts can faintly sense it?\"\nThe silver, strange fish nodded, as if it understood.\nDong Muyun’s eyes shifted slightly, sweeping across the land beneath her feet. \"Is it going to appear so soon? Months ahead of predictions. What happened?\"\nHowever, looking at the distant Heart of Woods base, Dong Muyun’s expression gradually calmed. \"An Intermediate Breeder? Interesting. It seems I’ll have to find time to personally meet this young friend in a few days.\"\n***\nSu Ping was obviously unaware that his decision not to continue renting Pet Beasts that day had led to Manager Guan being directly banished from his position.\nIt wasn’t that he was lazy. Though tired, his efforts were indeed bearing fruit.\nBesides the three Pet Beasts whose skill levels had a breakthrough during combat, Su Ping had another pleasant surprise when he woke up that morning: Little Ones and Xiao Qing had both undergone changes.\nLittle Ones had grasped the Forest Wolf’s primary combat skill: Vine Strangling.\nAnd Xiao Qing, much to Su Ping’s relief, had grasped Self-Healing.\nSuch progress demonstrated the necessity of actual combat experience for Pet Beasts.\nAlas, since waking up—no, since being jolted awake by a phone call that morning—he hadn’t had a moment’s peace. He was now beginning to understand why Vice President Liu had said what he did upon leaving.\nThe calls included Junior Breeders also skilled with Forest Wolves and curious Intermediate Breeders. There were also Forest Wolf Beast Tamers wanting to consult about cultivation services, and representatives from companies or studios wanting to recruit him, with compensation and benefits open to discussion. Some even made offers to purchase the Heart of Woods cultivation method at unimaginable prices. Finally, a journalist from a media outlet came wanting an interview.\nThere was no way around it. As an eighteen-year-old Intermediate Breeder, even a little publicity about him was sure to attract considerable attention.\nHow could the media not be interested in such a perfect news story?\nSu Ping decisively silenced his phone.\nThen, he finally understood why the certificate badge of an Intermediate Breeder had made Jin Cheng so envious the day before. For the first time, he realized that such a high-profit business could attract so many incessant inquiries.\nThis was especially true after he saw that the still-in-training Woodhead and Little Ones had also awakened the Heart of Woods.\nIt’s as if these people have no use for money!\nIt made Su Ping quite embarrassed to raise the price again to five million, but this barely reduced the number of inquiries.\nAlthough most were just inquiries, and not many actually paid a deposit, when people asked, he couldn’t just ignore them, could he?\nPerhaps some might wonder: why spend so much money cultivating a Forest Wolf? With just a little more, one could try to buy a Pet Beast with greater Racial Potential.\nThe issue wasn’t so simple. Not everyone is born with money and opportunities. Many people’s first contracted Pet Beast was a Forest Wolf. Later, they might have become successful and had higher-level choices, but the contract was already completed. Such cases were not rare. Moreover, as one of Linzhou City’s original Pet Beasts, the Forest Wolf had many developed evolution paths, and its cultivation potential was not low either.\nIn such a rush, Su Ping couldn’t even personally supervise Pet Beast training, let alone find time to take Pet Beasts for rental battles.\nFinally, after a busy day sending off the last two inquiring Beast Tamers, Su Ping stood at his own gate and let out a long sigh of relief.\nHowever, he soon noticed a distinct figure standing not far away at the bus stop.\nIt was Manager Guan.\nSu Ping was just about to speak.\nAfter all, I promised him yesterday,\nhe thought,\nand now I’m not going. I should at least explain.\nBut before he could open his mouth, he saw Manager Guan, suitcase in hand, boarding the bus.\nSu Ping frowned slightly, watching the bus recede into the distance, lost in thought.\nSoon, however, he shook his head. Before he could dwell on it further, another private car drove up nearby.\nThen, the car door opened. \"Excuse me, is this Breeder Su’s cultivation base?\"\nFor the first time, Su Ping felt so overwhelmed.\nAnd for the first time in his life, he thought,\nMaking money is truly not for humans! It’s just too agonizing.",

Wearing a mask and holding tweezers, with a wooden basket on his back, he continued to sort through the Forest Wolf droppings before him, which resembled wood shavings.\nOnly this time, he wasn’t the only one subjected to this torment. Beside him, Li Shu looked aggrieved and indignant.\n\"Bro Ping, is this how you introduce me to the work and life of a Breeder?\"\nSu Ping glanced at him. \"If you’re not willing, then get lost! There are plenty of Junior Breeders out there eager to be apprentices.\"\nDeflated, Li Shu returned to diligently scooping poop. After giving him a look, Su Ping nodded in satisfaction.\nAlthough Li Shu was a bit unpredictable, he was reliable and enthusiastic in his work.\nA good assistant indeed. That’s right, an assistant.\nIt had been two days since Li Shu had come to deliver Su Ping’s Intermediate Breeder certificate. In those two days, Su Ping felt he had received more phone calls than in his entire life. This was the influence of the Breeder Association’s backing. Now, Su Ping was beginning to understand the power of such official organizations.\nAs a result, Su Ping had switched his original phone number to serve as the Heart of Woods reception line. He then applied for a new one and sent the new number to people he knew, finally getting some peace.\nAlthough many inquiries came by phone, most did not follow up after hearing the price. The Beast Tamers with real intentions to pay for Cultivation were those who personally visited. Li Shu was responsible for receiving them, handling guests in the morning and learning basic Cultivation for interacting with Forest Wolves from Su Ping in the afternoon.\nAs for Su Ping, he had pleaded for mercy, asking Vice President Liu to take down the promotional advertisement. He also wrote the Cultivation prices and a new Rule at the entrance: Only one Forest Wolf will be accepted for Cultivation per week. If interested, please schedule an appointment.\nFinally, the world became completely quiet.\nMoney can never be enough,\nSu Ping mused.\nThe purpose of making money is to cultivate Pet Beasts better; priorities should not be confused.\nOtherwise, Su Ping wouldn’t have the time to leisurely scoop poop with Li Shu here.\nAs for returning to Yuntian Resort to rent Pet Beasts, Su Ping hadn’t gone again. After speaking with Qin Xiaoxue, Su Ping had become much more cautious about Yuntian Resort. Moreover, as he had said that day, renting so many Pet Beasts in a row meant he had to constantly watch over them at Yun Tian, which was both worrisome and exhausting. Although battles greatly improved the Pet Beasts, doing it occasionally was fine; however, daily battles were too much. The Forest Wolves might withstand it, but Su Ping couldn’t.\nLi Shu glanced at Su Ping, sincere admiration flashing in his eyes.\nLi Shu might appear frivolous, but he wasn’t dumb. This became clear when he talked to his father, Li Senlin, via video chat that night. Upon mentioning Su Ping’s Intermediate Breeder certificate, Li Senlin reacted as if he had seen a ghost. Even his father had shamelessly tried to use Li Shu’s connection to see if he could interview Su Ping, but regrettably, he was politely declined.\nWhat did it mean for a peer to so drastically alter his father’s opinion of his friendships?\nAlthough his own Talent was average, in a society so closely intertwined with Pet Beasts, everyone wanted to become a professional Beast Tamer or find a profession where they could rely entirely on Pet Beasts for a living. Besides passion, it also represented a promising future. Therefore, he was also thick-skinned in his desire to stay here longer.\nBeing able to learn a little more from Su Ping would be good.\nSu Ping himself didn’t really care; in fact, he was quite happy to have Li Shu stay. The reason was pretty simple. For example, right then, Su Ping wasn’t carrying much Forest Wolf dung, but Li Shu’s basket was piled high with it.\nAnd right then, the two of them stood before a particular item.\nIt was a small pine tree, only about one meter tall. The vibrant green leaves swayed gently, as if welcoming their master’s arrival. This was the Luozisong (Pine), a Plant-based Pet Beast with Elite Tier Racial Potential. Its main combat Skill was the Pine Cone Cannon; it could condense pine cones on its branches and shoot them out with great power, making it a stationary artillery-type Pet Beast.\n\"Do you know why I had you shovel poop?\" Su Ping asked.\n\"First, getting the scent of Forest Wolf dung on you can greatly reduce their aggression towards you, or even eliminate their hostility. With me around, you can get closer to other wild Forest Wolves.\n\"Second, some Plant Type Pet Beasts absorb Forest Wolf dung extremely well, which can accelerate their growth. The Luozisong is one of them.\n\"That’s all. If we were outside, forget about shoveling it for free; you’d have to pay me a thousand Gold just for the privilege of touching it!\"\nLi Shu’s eyes lit up, and he instantly straightened. \"My fault! I didn’t appreciate your painstaking efforts, adoptive father! I deserve to die! From now on, adoptive father, you can leave the Forest Wolves’ daily poop to me! If the Luozisong doesn’t use it all up, I will!\"\nWatching Li Shu thump his chest and make promises, Su Ping glanced sideways at the guy. But he was too lazy to contradict this show-off’s antics; instead, he turned his gaze to the Luozisong in front of him.\nHe had agreed to let Li Shu stay at the Heart of Woods for a while, not only because he had a good relationship with Li Shu, but also because Li Shu had indirectly done him a great favor by leading to Qin Xiaoxue’s arrival. After all, without Qin Xiaoxue, it would have been difficult for Heart of Woods to secure its first round of start-up capital, let alone the subsequent acquaintance with Vice President Liu and that special wager.\nBesides these reasons, there was another main one: this Luozisong.\nWithin the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, there were countless Pet Beast Compendiums waiting to be illuminated and activated. Although the Luozisong wasn’t his Pet Beast, as long as he reached the intimacy threshold with one, he could activate its compendium entry. Upgrading was one aspect, but just by activating it, he could receive corresponding rewards. Su Ping naturally wouldn’t miss out on the Origin rewards of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas.\nTherefore, Su Ping also wanted to use the time Li Shu was here to try and bond with the Luozisong, hoping to increase its intimacy to the required level, light up the Luozisong’s Pet Beast Compendium entry, and obtain a reward.\nTo prepare for this, Su Ping had even consulted abundant information on the Cultivation requirements and details for the Luozisong, but hadn’t found anything particularly useful. He then asked Qin Xiaoxue for some tips on cultivating Plant-based Pet Beasts, which gave him a bit more confidence.\nForest Wolf dung was a fertilizer that the majority of Pet Beasts in the Plant System desperately needed. Unfortunately, the fertilizing Magic Potion formulas for these Plant-based Pet Beasts were also hard to come by; even with money, Su Ping found them difficult to collect. Su Ping could only use the most basic method: mixing quality soil with the Forest Wolf dung and applying it around the Luozisong.\nBut before Su Ping had a chance to get closer to the Luozisong in front of him, to communicate feelings and experience the relatively tender expressions of a Plant-based Pet Beast, his phone suddenly chimed with a DING-DONG sound.\nHe took it out and saw a message appear:\n[The item you purchased has been delivered. Please come outside to receive it promptly, thank you!]\nA hint of joy flashed in Su Ping’s eyes.\nThe materials he had purchased for millions of Gold had finally arrived! Could the Heart of Woods Cultivation for the other Forest Wolves, and Xiao Qing’s intake of Poison System resources, finally begin?\nFollow current novels on No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt",

Courier Wang Hao, employee ID 95,841, and his Pet Beast courier, Gaga, greet you.\"\n\"Gaga!\"\n\"Please check your delivery items. If everything is correct, you may sign for it.\"\nAfter inspecting the materials from the Giant Feathered Sparrow named Gaga and from the courier’s Space Ring, Su Ping verified that everything was correct before signing for the package.\nInside were less than twenty sets of materials for the Heart of Woods Magic Potion, as well as the four portions of Poison System Resources.\nIt cost Su Ping over four million, all the money he had earned from Qin Xiaoxue.\nLi Shu was still fertilizing the Luozisong pines, so Su Ping didn’t ask for his help.\nWhen dealing with goods worth millions, one could never be too careful.\nBesides, even if Su Ping had asked Li Shu, knowing what these materials were, Li Shu would likely have been reluctant to handle them.\nSu Ping took Xiao Qing, who was still in training, and immediately headed to the medical room without stopping.\nHe could hardly wait.\nCompared to crafting new Magic Potions to cultivate other Forest Wolves to obtain the Heart of Woods skill, his own soul-bonded Pet Beast was naturally more important.\nMoreover, Su Ping had been eager to test Xiao Qing’s tolerance for these Poison System Resources.\n\"AWOOO!\"\nXiao Qing was quite excited too.\nThe little creature could sense its master’s excitement; moreover, it was here that it had comprehended the Heart of the Poison Wood.\nThis place held special significance in Xiao Qing’s heart.\nAfter turning on the Life Detector to monitor Xiao Qing’s vital signs, Su Ping put on a gas mask before carefully opening a small wooden box he had brought.\nAlthough these Poison System Resources had been processed, Beast Tamers were more vulnerable than Pet Beasts at this stage. It was always better to err on the side of caution.\nIt was a special type of plant.\nWith dark green branches and leaves, it had three dark purple flowers.\nThe flowers were still vibrant, yet they emitted no pungent smell. Instead, they possessed an indescribable, seductive beauty.\nYet, such a beautiful plant had an unfitting name: Wolfsbane Aconite.\nThe name was ferocious, but it was actually the cheapest among the three Poison System Resources he had purchased.\nIt was a purely plant-based Poison System Resource, unrelated to Poison Type Pet Beasts.\nTherefore, it had relatively low value and could only be helpful to some common Poison Type Pet Beasts.\nBut that was enough.\nXiao Qing’s reaction confirmed that Su Ping’s decision was correct.\nUpon seeing the plant, Xiao Qing’s deep eyes fixed on it, its entire attention captured.\nAs a carnivore, its desire for such a plant was a call from its bloodline and genes.\nHowever, Pet Beasts do not know self-restraint, but Su Ping did. He put on specially-made gloves. He wouldn’t give the entire Wolfsbane Aconite directly to Xiao Qing to swallow.\nInstead, he plucked a single purple flower and handed it to Xiao Qing.\nXiao Qing swallowed it in one bite. Without even chewing, it gulped down the flower.\nSu Ping was somewhat speechless.\nThen, the Pet Beast and its master just stared at each other. After a full ten minutes, watching his master’s eyes behind the gas mask turn almost red from staring, Xiao Qing tilted its head and uttered, \"AWOOO.\"\nSu Ping’s eyelid twitched. He quickly glanced at the Life Detector; all readings were normal, and not even its heart rate or pulse had risen in the slightest.\nNot strong enough?\nClearly, the ingestion of this Wolfsbane Aconite seemed to have no significant effect on Xiao Qing.\nSo, Su Ping picked another flower from the Wolfsbane Aconite.\nIt was the same swift process, the same familiar GULP, and the same familiar ten minutes of a staring contest.\n\"AWOOO...\"\nXiao Qing opened its mouth again, sticking out its tongue and licking its lips; the implication was clear.\nLooking at the remaining flower and leaves of the Wolfsbane Aconite, Su Ping fell into doubt.\nCould I have actually bought a fake?\nThat made no sense—the Beast Master Association cracked down hard on such things!\nHowever, Su Ping soon narrowed his eyes.\n\"Xiao Qing, open your mouth.\"\n\"AWOO?\"\nXiao Qing opened its mouth and looked doubtfully at its master. Su Ping took a closer look and, sure enough, its normally pink tongue now had some faint purple coloration. Other than that, there were no changes.\nThis time, Su Ping gritted his teeth, prepared an antidote and stomach lavage equipment, and then placed the entire remaining Wolfsbane Aconite in front of Xiao Qing.The source of this content ɪs NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nGULP.\nIt swallowed it in one bite.\nSu Ping’s heart tensed.\nPoison System Resources were not like other resources. If other resources didn’t work, they generally didn’t pose much of a life-threatening risk, but Poison System Resources were different. Su Ping even had to provide identification when purchasing these items.\nSure enough!\nThis time, within five minutes, Su Ping saw on the Life Detector that Xiao Qing’s pulse and heartbeat began to accelerate.\nSu Ping held his breath, intently watching Xiao Qing’s condition and the Life Detector.\nXiao Qing, which had seemed spirited before, suddenly drooped, slumping onto the table. Purple, vein-like markings even surfaced on its body. However, the traces were very faint.\nThis purple, appearing on Xiao Qing’s originally emerald-green fur, looked particularly striking. However, these purple, vein-like markings lasted only a few minutes before disappearing again.\nAfterward, Xiao Qing reopened its eyes and stood up.\nSu Ping, however, furrowed his brows slightly.\nHe was, of course, relieved that Xiao Qing’s life was not in danger, but now, there was no improvement in its Realm or Skills. Even his guess that the Heart of the Poison Wood’s effects might improve didn’t pan out; there was no change whatsoever.\nThis left Su Ping slightly disappointed.\nBut this was also normal. After all, the Wolfsbane Aconite was the most basic of Poison System Resources and not very valuable.\nAnd now that Xiao Qing had reached the Ordinary Sixth Stage, it would have been unreasonable for it to advance so easily. The Heart of the Poison Wood’s effect was powerful, and Xiao Qing’s mutated Poison Type bloodline was remarkable, but there was no reason for such rapid improvement.\nHowever, just as this thought surfaced, Su Ping was surprised to find that the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas had suddenly reacted. On the Forest Wolf’s emerald-green card, beneath the log entries, a new record slowly appeared:\n[The effectiveness of Poison Type cultivation for Pet Beasts with mutated Poison Type bloodlines has marginally improved; analysis requirements have been somewhat reduced.]\n[Further analysis into the reasons for the Forest Wolf’s Poison Type mutation is now possible. By expending 49,990 Experience Points from this Catalog, you can forcibly determine the cause of the Forest Wolf’s Poison Type bloodline mutation and obtain the mutation cultivation method.]",

      "content": "Chapter 44: Chapter 44: Proficient Level Poison Vine Strangulation! Xiao Qing’s Improvement! (Three Updates)\nHmm?\nSu Ping raised his eyebrows as he felt the feedback from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas regarding Xiao Qing’s recent changes. Although he hadn’t seen any progress in Xiao Qing through the Eye of Truth, the display from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas indicated Xiao Qing’s condition.\nNot to mention anything else, just the fact that the Experience Points needed to analyze Xiao Qing’s bloodline mutation had decreased is already tremendous news. Even though it’s just a reduction of a mere ten Experience Points, isn’t this just the beginning? Could it be that as long as I correspondingly enhance Xiao Qing’s Poison Type bloodline and help it ingest Poison System Resources, the Experience Points required for analysis will continue to decrease? Compared to the Poison System Resources that can be purchased with money, the Experience Points from the Catalog are undoubtedly more precious.\nOver the past few days, even though no other Forest Wolf had reached the required affinity for a significant rise in Catalog Experience, through daily training and the continuous improvement of these little ones, Su Ping’s Forest Wolf Catalog Experience had risen to over one hundred, nearing two hundred. Although it was still far from two thousand, Experience Points were not solely used for upgrading the Catalog.\nWhat I’m concerned about is perfecting the other Cultivation methods and the Evolution method for the ’Wanmu Wolf’ that Sun Chaoju is soon to lose to me. That incomplete Evolution Cultivation method will undoubtedly require a large consumption of Experience Points to supplement. I need to be prepared.\nSu Ping resolved.\nAfter patting Xiao Qing’s head, which was still somewhat confused, Su Ping began to worry anew.\nMutated Pet Beasts were indeed excellent, possessing Abilities and development different from other Pet Beasts; Xiao Qing, for instance, could break through its race limit. But there was a downside: the uncertainty in their future Evolution.\nIt’s true that Breeders can change some materials during the Cultivation and Evolution process based on the mutant Attributes. However, such Breeders are exceedingly rare and valuable. My current status is entirely due to the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas. When it comes to Cultivation and Evolution, I’m still a beginner.\nWith this in mind, Su Ping’s gaze hardened.\nThe power of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas is undisputed. Perhaps, as the Catalog improves, it might be possible to develop a perfect Evolutionary Form for Mutated Pet Beasts like Xiao Qing. But for now, that isn’t possible. What I need to do now is improve my Breeder ability and truly become an elite Breeder! That way, I can find the perfect method for Xiao Qing’s future Evolution!\nWith that thought, Su Ping’s spirits lifted suddenly.\nTime waits for no one. However, these things can’t be accomplished overnight.\nFor now, the most important thing was to take Xiao Qing for a test.\nHe led Xiao Qing, who had regained its spirit, out of the woods. This time, Su Ping didn’t pick one of the Little Ones as a test subject but directly found a Forest Wolf that had reached the Elite Tier.\n\"San Ha, come here!\"\nSu Ping was casual with naming these Forest Wolves. As long as they could be recognized, it was barely acceptable.\nThe Forest Wolf called San Ha trotted over proudly and energetically. Then, under the resentful gaze of San Ha, Xiao Qing’s purple vines swiftly wrapped around it. The serrated barbs painfully pierced San Ha’s unresisting fur.\nSu Ping naturally understood his own Pet Beasts better than the other Forest Wolves. Quickly, he noticed something.Google seaʀᴄh ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\nAlthough there were no improvements in Xiao Qing’s tier, realm, or skill level, I can sense from San Ha’s reaction that the toxicity of Xiao Qing’s Poison Vine Strangulation has increased. As for how much and to what extent, more extensive testing will be required to determine that.\nHowever, just as he was about to stop the fight, the purple vines around San Ha suddenly darkened dramatically, and their texture acquired an indescribably different feel. What was previously as thin as a finger, in a split second, thickened to the girth of a baby’s wrist!\n\"AROOO!\"\nSan Ha, who had only been somewhat resentful and discontented, suddenly let out a scream of agony. Clearly, while the Poison Vine Strangulation had caused it some discomfort, this sudden change brought an indescribable pain, even a sense of threat!\nSu Ping reacted instantly, his Eye of Truth locking onto Xiao Qing. Sure enough, at this moment, Xiao Qing’s Poison Vine Strangulation had unexpectedly advanced from Beginner to the Proficient Level!\nAlthough the shared connection ability means the skill levels of my Pet Beasts increase rapidly, Xiao Qing’s improvement is indeed beyond my expectations. Currently, Xiao Qing hasn’t even fully mastered all of its Racial Skills, with Accelerated Growth still to be comprehended, yet Sunlight Absorption and Poison Vine Strangulation have already reached the Proficient Level. Of course, this is also due to Xiao Qing’s outstanding innate Talent.\nAt the same time, I’ve also confirmed one thing: the ’Vine Strangling’ practiced by the Forest Wolves can be shared and utilized alongside Xiao Qing’s ’Poison Vine Strangulation’. Apart from recently comprehending Self-Healing, what’s left to learn is Heart of the Poison Wood. However, this ability is a semi-passive skill, and currently, with only Woodhead, Old Sha, Little One, and Xiao Qing linked together, the shared training effect is relatively average. Of course, that problem is no longer an issue now! All the materials I bought for the Heart of Woods Magic Potion were for this very moment, weren’t they? Moreover, I also want to test the other effects and uses of the Magic Potion.\nInstantly, Su Ping waved his hand, instructing Xiao Qing and Woodhead to continue their prior training, one acting as the attacking party while the other focused on practicing the ’Self-Healing’ skill.\nMeanwhile, he called out in a loud voice, \"Old Sha!\"\n\"AWOO!\"\nOld Sha, who hadn’t heard the young master call him individually for a long time, immediately perked up his ears like the most loyal of butlers, stiffening his neck in anticipation of the young master’s command.\n\"Come on, it’s time to pull weeds!\"\nInstantly, Old Sha’s perked ears drooped.\n\"AWOOO...\"\nHis voice became listless.\nHe knew all too well what ’pulling weeds’ entailed!\nLuckily, this time, aside from master and servant, there was another helper...\n「Eventually, night fell.」\nLi Shu, after a busy day, returned to his room. His father, Li Senlin, initiated a video call.\n\"Son, how is it going, learning with Su Ping? I tell you, you’ve encountered such an outstanding and formidable classmate. Study hard with him; don’t fear hardship or fatigue! It’s a rare opportunity, and his willingness to teach you is a blessing for our family. But we also can’t neglect courtesy. When I come to pick you up, I’ll bring some gifts for Su Ping. What does that little guy like...\"\nWatching his father’s earnest expectation, Li Shu pressed his lips together.\nHe didn’t know how to break it to his dad.\nEven at this moment, Li Shu’s eyes were filled with deep confusion.\nA Breeder, an Intermediate Level Breeder registered with the Breeder Association, was, by his father’s description and his own understanding, a truly respected person. In his imagination, such a Breeder’s day should revolve around Pet Beasts, casually instructing them so they would learn various amazing Skills, improving at speeds countless times faster than those under the care of Beast Tamers—talents admired by many. But today, after a day at Heart of Woods, he understood Su Ping’s routine all too well. What had he done today, tagging along with Su Ping? Or rather, from his perspective, what had Su Ping done all day? To put it simply: scooping poop, cutting grass, watching Pet Beasts spar. Is this what a Breeder’s day really is? How astonishing and disillusioning.",

      "content": "Chapter 45: Chapter 45: Wood’s Breakthrough! The Bet is Settled! (Four More)\nIn front of Su Ping were more than ten vessels.\nContained within these vessels were all items of an inky green hue.\nEven Su Ping couldn’t help but feel a thrill of excitement at the sight of these more than ten bottles of Heart of Woods Magic Potion.\nThese items had a cost price of several million already. If calculated by profit, their total value would soar into the tens of millions.\nSu Ping had never encountered such a large sum of money in his past or present life. And now, it was laid out right before his eyes.\nHowever, Su Ping wasn’t in a hurry to administer it all to his Forest Wolves.\nHe wanted to perfect his understanding of cultivation. The Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas provided direct answers, but it didn’t explain the reasoning or the process to him. Now, Su Ping aimed to reverse-engineer this process and reasoning step by step, based on these answers. These Magic Potions could offer him some assistance in this endeavor.\nSu Ping stored several bottles in the freezer for preservation. These would serve as his reserves and start-up capital for cultivating other Pet Beasts. He still left out more than ten bottles.\nSu Ping then immediately opened two bottles, reserving them for upcoming experiments. The cost of experimenting with just these two bottles was already substantial.\nSu Ping took a spoon and carefully scooped out one-tenth from one of the bottles. From the other, he directly poured out half.\nThis was Su Ping’s first time cultivating Pet Beasts, so he had no prior experience. However, after becoming an Intermediate Breeder and gaining some understanding of various Pet Beast Breeding Bases, he came to realize something.\nPet Beasts weren’t cultivated so easily. With individuals like Woodhead and Qin Xiaoxue, it was one thing, but what if people with ulterior motives appeared? What if they allowed their Pet Beasts to interact with his, only to steal cultivation methods and techniques through communication with the beasts? This wasn’t baseless speculation; it was a distinct possibility.\nTherefore, even with a Magic Potion like Heart of Woods, it was best not to feed it all at once, as that would allow the Pet Beast to achieve instant comprehension. Instead, administering it in batches and pairing it with some unusual training would serve two purposes: it would extend the duration, making the cultivation time seem more reasonable, and it would also prevent the cultivation methods from being easily leaked.\nNevertheless, Su Ping wanted to test if administering it in batches would affect the potion’s efficacy.\nHe called over two Forest Wolves. Administering one-tenth of the Magic Potion to one of them directly yielded no additional effects.\nSu Ping then found another Forest Wolf and gave it half of the Heart of Woods Magic Potion.\nThis time, there was a difference. The Forest Wolf’s body began to glow faintly, but the effect ultimately disappeared. Evidently, it had failed to achieve comprehension.\nSu Ping wasn’t disheartened. So far, it seemed there was at least some effect. He could take his time experimenting over the next few days.\nWith that thought, Su Ping took out paper and pen and quickly began recording the changes in the Forest Wolves before him.\nLi Shu, who had been taking care of the Luozisong, finally couldn’t resist asking, \"Bro Ping, what is this...?\"\nSu Ping glanced at him.\nEarlier, while Su Ping was making the Magic Potion, this fellow had been trying to bond with the Forest Wolves—a necessary step for a Junior Breeder. If possible, helping a classmate—who could be considered his only good friend—avoid a few detours while he was assisting wasn’t a big deal. However, the Heart of Woods Magic Potion represented not only the knowledge passed down through the Su Family for many years but also unimaginable wealth and temptation. Su Ping didn’t want to use such things to test people’s hearts; it was meaningless. He wasn’t the type to test others anyway.\nSo, he simply answered vaguely, \"It’s a special food for Forest Wolves that can accelerate their growth.\"\nStrictly speaking, he wasn’t lying.\nLi Shu nodded without asking further and even said in agreement, \"So that’s it! I was just thinking, only Forest Wolves would like this kind of smell!\"\nAs soon as Li Shu said this, Su Ping was momentarily stunned. A flash of insight, a peculiar idea, inexplicably crossed his mind again.The most update n0vels are published on\nSu Ping blinked. He seemed to have suddenly understood something that wasn’t particularly profound. Why had the addition of Wolf Tobacco to his family’s Heart of Woods Magic Potion resulted in such a qualitative change? Although the perfected recipe was recreated based on the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, the fact that adding just this one ingredient could achieve such an effect meant Wolf Tobacco’s impact was absolutely extraordinary. So, was it possible that Wolf Tobacco inherently had some effect on Forest Wolves?\nSu Ping suddenly felt invigorated. The joy of Pet Beast cultivation lay in discovering a new direction, a new possibility, and then trying, experimenting, and perfecting it—this was the normal development path for a Pet Beast Breeder.\nAlthough testing this possibility seemed somewhat inhumane to his little companions, Su Ping believed that for their master to become a truly great Breeder, they would be willing to make that small sacrifice!\nAt that moment, Su Ping looked towards the eagerly attentive pack of Forest Wolves, his eyes shimmering with a faint, eerie green glow.\nIn that instant, Su Ping seemed even more wolf-like than the pack itself.\nAll the wolves, including Old Sha, instinctively tucked their tails and shied away from their young master’s gaze.\nHowever, just then, a clear whimper sounded. The source of this whimper wasn’t any of Su Ping’s Forest Wolves, but rather the most special one in the entire pack.\nWoodhead!\nMiss Qin’s treasured pet, now fully integrated into Su Ping’s wolf pack—a top-tier Forest Wolf.\nBut at this very moment, Qin Xiaoxue’s cherished pet trembled, enveloped in a gentle halo of white light.\nWoodhead still had some injuries on his body. His bluish-gray fur was extremely disheveled, with traces of blood underneath. An onlooker might think Su Ping was abusing the poor creature. However, in truth, Woodhead’s injuries were the lightest compared to the other sixteen Forest Wolves in the pack.\nEspecially under the envelopment of that gentle white halo, the previously scabbed scars were visibly healing at an astonishing speed. This rate of recovery was comparable to that of an Elite Level professional healing-type Pet Beast.\nClearly, Woodhead was not in this state because of his injuries.\nSu Ping, who was extremely familiar with Forest Wolves, immediately understood what was happening.\nSure enough, as the soft glow disappeared, the injuries on Woodhead’s body had mostly healed.\nSuch self-healing ability and effect certainly couldn’t be accomplished by entry-level Self-Healing, not even for Woodhead, who was a top-tier Elite Level Forest Wolf!\nThere was only one possibility left!\nAnd indeed, under the observation of the Eye of Truth, Woodhead’s Skills section now showed the ’Self-Healing’ skill, with its level having evolved from Beginner to ’Proficient’!\nHis gamble had paid off!",

      "content": "Chapter 46: Chapter 46 The Research and Discovery of Wolf Smoke Grass (First Update)\nThe growth of the tree was complete, but Su Ping did not hurry to find Qin Xiaoxue and have her call Sun Chaoju and Vice President Liu to fulfill the wager. A full fifteen days, half a month, remained, and there indeed was no need to rush.\nThough he was eager to obtain the accelerated growth and the evolution methods for the Wanmu Wolf, meals must be eaten one bite at a time. Besides, even if he obtained these now, with the current experience of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, he would be unable to fully document them.\nAs for Su Ping’s current schedule, it was quite packed. These were tasks he had set for himself, and the past days had been extremely fulfilling.\nIn the morning, he would take Li Shu to feed the Forest Wolves, clean up after them, and start planning the day’s training for the wolves. Those whose training was most outstanding were rewarded with a portion of the Heart of Woods Magic Potion.\nThat’s right, a portion. Previously, of two Forest Wolves, one consumed one-tenth of the Magic Potion with no change, while the other, after taking half, was given the other half by Su Ping the next day and then had an epiphany.\nIf half was effective, Su Ping later tried a quarter, which also worked. Directly consuming the Heart of Woods Magic Potion was too conspicuous, so feeding it in batches yielded even better results.\nDuring the day, when the sunlight was plentiful and with the effect of Sunlight Absorption, the pack of Forest Wolves recovered their physical strength extremely well. Hence, the training effect was even better.\nNot to mention, in just a few days, aside from the lack of unexpected Skill Level breakthroughs, several Forest Wolves experienced substantial improvements in Level and Realm. Even one young Forest Wolf that had been stuck at Common Tenth Level achieved a promotion to the adult Elite Tier.\nThe Cultivation of Pet Beasts is not solely dependent on the Race’s Racial Potential limits! While the Forest Wolf’s race limit is Elite Tenth Stage, this is the cap for Forest Wolf evolution, not the Level every Forest Wolf can reach! Some lazy Forest Wolves, without battle or training to improve themselves, would be considered quite fortunate if they could naturally break through to the Elite Level.\nAfter the training for the Forest Wolves was arranged, Li Shu would act as the receptionist in the morning, while Su Ping was responsible for another matter: building a good relationship with Li Shu’s Luozisong. In Li Shu’s words, Bro Ping treated his Luozisong better than he treated him. Not only did Su Ping cultivate it personally, but he would occasionally use some low-level spirit spring water to water the Luozisong. As a result, in these few days, the Luozisong had \"plumped\" up a little.\nCome afternoon, Su Ping conducted experiments on the theory Li Shu had mentioned a few days ago. He also cultivated new Forest Wolves.\nThat’s right, after the Breeder Association’s advertisements were officially registered and published, the business for Heart of Woods suddenly boomed. Even though Su Ping had raised his prices and limited the Cultivation to once a week, there were still people lining up. It was just one Forest Wolf, and indeed, it did not require much intensive Cultivation. If anything could be considered a bit of a waste of time, it might be Su Ping’s need to foster the Forest Wolf’s Affinity towards him during the process. Besides increasing the experience for the Forest Wolf’s entry in the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas,\nWho knows? It could turn into a returning customer.\nPlus, he could make money on the side. Why not?\nAll these were fine, but what deserved special mention was Su Ping’s experiment. This was, indeed, quite an inhumane experiment.\nThe subjects were two of his own Forest Wolves, both at Ordinary Level. These two were also special among the pack, as they had each consumed only one-tenth of the Heart of Woods Magic Potion. Su Ping had never thought much about Wolf Tobacco before, but its addition had greatly amplified the Heart of Woods’ effects.\nThis indicated that this highly reproductive yet pungent special plant might have uses unknown to me?\nAnd so, these two little fellows had become Su Ping’s test subjects. That’s right, under Su Ping’s orders and Old Sha’s pitying, watchful gaze, they had been coming to the Lingxi River over the past few days.\nWhat for? It was simple!\nEating grass! One ate grass while the other basked in the sun.\nAlso, every morning, Su Ping had been taking out one-tenth of the Heart of Woods Magic Potion to give to the two little ones. This was to ensure their changes wouldn’t be affected by external factors.\nHowever, over the course of these days, Su Ping had not noticed any changes. He looked at his journal. On it, a simple line was written: [Investigating the effect of Wolf Tobacco on Forest Wolves consuming the Heart of Woods Magic Potion to deduce Wolf Tobacco’s unknown properties.]\nThis was already the sixth day of the experiment. For these six days, this was how Su Ping had spent his time.\nHe watched one Forest Wolf lazily soaking up the sun, while the other begrudgingly chewed on the abundant Wolf Tobacco on the ground. Clearly, from this little fellow’s infuriated gaze, one could tell that it was extremely discontented.\nWhy can’t I finish all this damned Wolf Tobacco?\nSu Ping paid no attention to the little one’s resentment, glanced at his journal, then looked over at Old Sha, who was extremely alert on the other side, and smiled, \"Don’t worry, although the Heart of Woods is on the outskirts of Linzhou City, the Beast Master Association and the military’s Beast Tamer Corps regularly patrol the city’s outskirts to drive out wild Pet Beasts. There’s no danger.\"\nStrangely enough, lately, whenever Su Ping brought the two little ones here, Old Sha would always follow. Even if Su Ping had told it to properly oversee the Forest Wolves’ training, Old Sha refused. From Old Sha’s stubbornness and certain behaviors, Su Ping understood the creature was actually worried about his safety, fearing enemies might be nearby.\nOf course, this was Su Ping’s speculation; although he had a full understanding of Forest Wolves, he couldn’t completely comprehend a Pet Beast’s thoughts without the Telepathic Communication Talent, especially a wild Pet Beast without a Soul Contract. However, Su Ping didn’t mind; Old Sha was one of his own. How could he force it against its will? Besides, it was a gesture of goodwill from Old Sha, and now, the training Forest Wolves were working very hard. Even without Old Sha’s supervision, he didn’t need to worry too much.\nYet, looking at Old Sha at this moment, Su Ping couldn’t help feeling worried. Old Sha had lived for over forty years; it was indeed very old.\nJust as his spirits sank, Su Ping’s gaze suddenly shifted.\nIt wasn’t that an enemy had appeared, but one of the Forest Wolves had unexpectedly changed!\nHalos of light enveloped it, with specks of light adhering to it. The next moment, a piercing Wolf Howl, though immature, rang out, filled with indescribable joy!\nSu Ping shot to his feet and rushed to its side, staring in disbelief. The other Forest Wolf, which was still lazily sunbathing, perked up its ears, blinked, and with great confusion in its small eyes, looked at its companion that had suddenly transformed.\nThe sixth day! Su Ping clenched his fists. The sixth day!\nThis meant that this Little Forest Wolf had, in effect, only consumed six-tenths of the Magic Potion—just a little over half.\nYet under these circumstances, the Little Forest Wolf actually managed to complete its comprehension so many days ahead of schedule. Could it be that Wolf Tobacco truly possesses effects unknown to me?\nAnd at this moment, abruptly, in Su Ping’s mind, the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas’s entry for the Forest Wolf once again slowly turned open.",

      "content": "Chapter 47: Chapter 47: Side Effects of the Wolf Smoke Herb, the Value of the Laboratory! (Second Update)\nAt the very bottom of the Catalog, above the previously recorded logs, a new entry appeared:\n[Discovery of the partial effects and applications of Wolf Tobacco on the Forest Wolf, Forest Wolf Catalog Experience Points +100. Fully understanding and excavating the specific effects and uses of Wolf Tobacco can yield additional experience points.]\nAs expected!\nA look of unimaginable joy surfaced in Su Ping’s eyes as he firmly fixated on the Forest Wolf that had completed its comprehension.\nBut soon, a slight frown creased Su Ping’s forehead.\nAs the light faded, the small Forest Wolf appeared before Su Ping’s eyes.\nAnd the Eye of Truth quickly assessed the status of the young wolf:\n[Forest Wolf (Wild - Weak)]Google seaʀᴄh NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\n[Current Level: Common Seventh Rank]\n[Racial Potential: Elite Tenth Stage]\n[Skills: Sunlight Absorption (Beginner), Accelerated Growth (Beginner), Vine Strangling (Proficient), Self-Healing (Beginner), Heart of Woods (Beginner)]\nIndeed, from the feedback of the Eye of Truth, it seemed there was no change or difference in the young wolf; even the Heart of Woods skill had already appeared on this little fellow.\nThe pervasive scent of grass and trees further confirmed this.\nThe state of weakness was nothing much.\nHowever, the biggest issue was that, prior to this, to ensure the experiment would not be affected, Su Ping had specifically chosen two wolves of the same level and realm for cultivation.\nAnd the realm of these two wolves was Common Eighth Rank!\nThis meant that while the Wolf Tobacco had indeed further enhanced the Forest Wolf’s affinity with the Heart of Woods, it had caused a decrease in its own level realm.\nWhat was the principle behind this?\nSu Ping frowned, but for the moment, he couldn’t figure it out. It was then he truly felt what it meant to be ’lacking knowledge only when it’s needed.’\nStill, he quickly made a mark on the young wolf and wrote down this research discovery in his notebook as a record.\nAfterward, without wasting any more time, Su Ping took out a sickle from his Beast Taming Space and continued harvesting the vast expanse of Wolf Tobacco.\nBefore, Su Ping hadn’t been sure and therefore hadn’t tried anything more complex.\nBut now it seemed that the effects of the Wolf Tobacco definitely held a mystery beyond his imagination.\nHe needed to extract the essence directly and begin live experiments.\nHowever, while he had some refining equipment at home, he was still missing certain items. For instance, his home cauldron, though generally sufficient, would be too cumbersome for extracting essence from Wolf Tobacco. The process would be too demanding in terms of both time and labor.\nThere were also some instruments needed for observation and recording.\nThinking of this, Su Ping, who had just harvested a large amount of Wolf Tobacco, also felt a bit of a headache.\nSome materials and resources were widely available online and in the real world, but when it came to precision instruments only used by Breeders, he really didn’t know where to buy them.\nLuckily, Su Ping now had some connections.\n\"Hey, Su Ping? It’s rare for you to call me. Could it be that you’ve finished your bet with Xiao Sun?\"\nProbably no one in Linzhou knew more about this area than Vice President Liu.\nMeeting Vice President Liu’s hearty laughter on the other end, Su Ping played coy for a moment: \"You’ll know about that in a couple of days. Old Liu, I wanted to ask, where can I buy equipment for extracting material essence and cultivation instruments for observing materials? I have some new ideas and want to give them a try.\"\n\"Haha, I guessed as much. Su Ping, do you know what the most important thing for a Breeder is?\"\nPerhaps because Su Ping was being coy, Vice President Liu didn’t answer directly but instead asked a question in return.\n\"What?\" Su Ping asked obligingly.\n\"It’s naturally the laboratory! With your ability, you could certainly come to our Breeder Association and apply to rent a private laboratory. Of course, if you’d prefer to buy your own equipment, that’s also an option. Our Breeder Association sells it.\"\nHaving said that, Old Liu went straight to the point: \"The instrument you mentioned for extracting material essence? Our Breeder Association has three types, each with its own strengths and effects. We also have the other equipment you need. I’ll send the details directly to you. After you take a look, you can place the order right away.\"\nAt this point, Vice President Liu seemed very straightforward: \"When you’ve placed your order, give me the order number, and I’ll use my authority to give you the maximum discount.\"\nSu Ping revealed a smile: \"Then I must thank you. I’ll come to see you when I have time!\"\n\"When will that be? I’ll adjust my schedule,\" came the chuckling voice of Vice President Liu, causing Su Ping to falter in his speech.\nHe pursed his lips, about to speak, when he heard laughter from the other end of the phone: \"Hahaha, just joking with you, kid. However, if you have time, you could come over at the end of the month. I’ll be teaching a class at the Breeder Association that is only accessible to wolf-type Pet Beast Breeders.\n\"I don’t know if it will be of any use or help to you, but no matter how talented a Breeder is, it’s best not to always work in isolation.\"\nThis time, Su Ping’s eyes truly lit up. Even though he had the help of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, it was like being handed an advanced-level math Olympiad problem along with its solution. While he now knew the answer and could replicate it for an identical problem, the underlying problem-solving methodology, the ability to draw parallels, or to extrapolate from it, was entirely beyond him.\nA book is invaluable at the right time, and he certainly wouldn’t miss such an opportunity.\nExcitedly hanging up the phone, Su Ping then opened the website address Old Liu had sent, which only member Breeders of the Breeder Association were qualified to use for purchasing.\nHowever, upon looking, Su Ping was stunned.\nHe seemed to understand why, when he asked Old Liu about purchasing equipment, Old Liu had bluntly told him that he could go to the Breeder Association to apply for a laboratory rental first.\nBecause the things in front of him were just too damn outrageous:\n[Automated Polymer Mechanical Core Compression Extraction Machine: An integrated machine controlled by a Mechanical Core, capable of compressing all types of resources except Elemental Type, extracting the essence according to its needs, and condensing it into...]\nThere was a long, convoluted description, of which Su Ping understood little. What he did see clearly was the string of zeros trailing after the price of this large machine, which resembled a cross between a large toilet and a washing machine, connected to a computer screen.\nAt this moment, Su Ping fell into deep thought.\nOld Liu just said he could give me a discount within his authority. So, how big could his discount be?\nCould he discount three hundred million down to one million? Hmm, even ten million would be acceptable!\nClearly, if this were a dream, Su Ping’s thoughts might have a chance of becoming reality.\nUnfortunately, this was real life.\nAnd that was just the cost of purchasing one machine, not including usage costs and the purchase of other machines.\nInstantly, Breeder Su, who just moments ago had felt his funds were sufficient, gazed at the innumerable stalks of Wolf Tobacco crammed into his tiny Beast Taming Space and roared at the heavens:\nI need customers! I need to make money! I need to build my own lab!",

(Third Update)\nThe urge to make money didn’t last long.\nAfter all, the decision made a few days ago to cultivate a maximum of one Pet Beast each week shouldn’t change so quickly—it wasn’t a good habit.\nAnd besides, it was just for researching Wolf Tobacco. Su Ping thought there was no need to use such high-quality equipment!\nWhat was wrong with his own medicine stove? It couldn’t isolate smells, and without a gas mask, one could easily be overcome by the fumes. It lacked an automatic stirring feature, requiring manual grinding with a pestle. It didn’t have a decomposition function and could only process materials into liquids or powders. It just...\nForget it, even Su Ping himself was having a hard time continuing this list.\nHowever, as long as his determination didn’t falter, there were always more solutions than difficulties.\nHe had no reason to stop researching Wolf Tobacco just like that. Using basic experimental facilities was also an option.\nAfter all, although he didn’t have high-quality equipment, he had people!\nSo, after bringing back the slightly weakened Little Forest Wolf, Old Sha, and another Forest Wolf from the banks of the Lingxi River behind the forest, Su Ping found Li Shu, who was training Songzi.\nAfter all, it wasn’t a technically difficult operation. He just needed to control the temperature, wear a gas mask, and continuously work the medicine stove. At most, he just needed to add some water in the middle and heat this big bundle of Wolf Tobacco until it completely condensed into liquid. That was all there was to it.\nThere was no technical difficulty.\nBut without a doubt, this was a necessary step on the path of a Breeder.\nYes. All these words were what Su Ping said to Li Shu.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nThen, meeting Su Ping’s trusting gaze, Li Shu fastened his gas mask and nodded with resolve.\nIt wasn’t easy! Having been at Su Ping’s place for a week now, he could finally participate in work relevant to a Breeder’s job. Although Li Shu could see that Wolf Tobacco wasn’t commonly found in the city, it was widespread in the uninhabited areas outside it. These herbs were clearly brought back by Su Ping deliberately to train him. He absolutely couldn’t betray his adoptive father’s trust!\n\"Go for it!\"\nAfter teaching Li Shu how to use the heating medicine stove, Su Ping called Old Sha, who wore a special wolf-dog gas mask, to watch for any issues. Only then did he fully relax.\nSu Ping then went to Songzi.\nEven though its master was gone, Songzi, the Luozisong, knew that Su Ping, who stood before it, was its master’s best friend. It was also thanks to this very person that it had been able to grow so robustly during this time. Its Realm had even broken through to ordinary Third Rank.\nPlant-type Pet Beasts generally lacked strong mobility but offered many functional uses.\nIf it weren’t for the fact that Songzi, the Luozisong, was difficult to cultivate and required a large area, making it hard to grow in large numbers, Su Ping would have considered choosing it as his second Pet Beast.\nHowever, while he couldn’t choose it, this couldn’t hide his fondness for this type of Pet Beast.\nThe small Songzi swayed gently. Though it had no face, the slight trembling of its trunk and branches clearly signified an interesting soul nestled within.\nDuring this past week, Su Ping had spared no effort in cultivating this little Songzi. Furthermore, before he returned to the Heart of Woods, Su Ping, while spending time with Li Shu, had interacted with this little guy on multiple occasions.\nHowever, since it was not a wolf-dog type Pet Beast, even with guidance from Old Sha, the Wolf King, and after such a long time, there wasn’t even a hint that the intimacy level had been reached.\nThis made Su Ping a bit helpless.\nNow, he was well-acquainted with the nature of Forest Wolves. After his Forest Wolf Catalog reached LV2, and with Old Sha’s guidance, even the Forest Wolves brought to him for Cultivation reached the required intimacy level in two or three days at most, some even in a single day.\nHowever, this little Songzi had truly taken a long time.\nFrom this, Su Ping could infer, albeit with some difficulty, that getting wild Pet Beasts to reach the required intimacy level in the future—and thus light up new entries in the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas—would be considerably more challenging.\nBut today, Su Ping came with a confident heart.\nBecause today, Su Ping had something extra in his hands.\nIt flickered with wisps of refreshing fragrance, but in reality, it had no physical form.\nThis thing, if called a treasure, indeed was one, but if not, it wouldn’t be of much use to other Pet Beasts or human Beast Tamers.\nThe Life Ancient Tree was Qin Xiaoxue’s second Pet Beast.\nHowever, that day, when Qin Xiaoxue saw Xiao Qing, who was also a Mutated Pet Beast, she answered Su Ping’s questions and satisfied his curiosity. This answered his question about the nature of the mutation of Qin Xiaoxue’s Life Ancient Tree and the direction it had taken.\nDeath!\nRight, although Su Ping had previously realized that Qin Xiaoxue’s Mutated Pet Beast was definitely not mediocre, he had not imagined that the Life Ancient Tree was a Mutated Pet Beast with both Life and Death Attributes coexisting.\nThe challenge of cultivating such Mutated Pet Beasts with completely opposite Attributes was unimaginable. It was vastly more complex than the Forest Wolf by countless degrees.\nQin Xiaoxue, however, was not stingy and had shared some of her Cultivation insights with him.\nThe Life Ancient Tree could not be handled carelessly; its Life and Death Attributes always needed to be balanced. However, since the Life Ancient Tree was a mutation, its essential Attribute was still predominantly Life, so its Death Attribute was more suppressed.\nTherefore, to maintain this balance, Qin Xiaoxue’s Life Ancient Tree needed to expel some Life Energy periodically to foster some Death Energy. Only under these circumstances could the Attribute balance of the Mutated Life Ancient Tree be prevented from collapsing.\nYes, the cluster of Energy Su Ping held was precisely the Life Force expelled by the Life Ancient Tree.\nThis Energy normally had no significant effect beyond healing injuries, but for Plant-type creatures, it was an excellent thing. It could not only expedite the growth of Plant-type Pet Beasts but could also enhance their potential and intelligence.\nAfter all, the Life Ancient Tree remained a powerful Pet Beast with the Racial Potential of the Monarch Level! If this Energy didn’t dissipate over time, Su Ping would indeed be reluctant to use it on little Songzi. And now, this was the trump card Su Ping was using to coax this little Songzi aboard his ’pirate ship’!\nAs expected, when Su Ping took out this pale green Energy, he could vividly feel little Songzi’s excitement, its branches waving even more swiftly.\nSu Ping couldn’t help but roll his eyes at this little fellow.\nAll Pet Beasts behaved the same way, not showing any interest unless they saw advantages to be gained.\nThe Life Energy slowly merged into little Songzi’s body.\nA faint green glow emanated from its body, slowly blooming. Then, as Songzi trembled, a fruit appeared on its branches.\nNext, the fruit shot out like a cannonball and burst open in the air!\nThis surge of Life Energy had actually helped the little fellow comprehend its most powerful combat Skill: Pine Cone Bomb.\nAlthough its power was negligible for now, there was great potential for future development.\nAnd not surprisingly, almost immediately after this anomaly vanished, the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas in Su Ping’s mind opened slowly.\nA brand-new page, one he had never seen before, appeared before Su Ping’s eyes!\nThe intimacy level of Songzi, the Luozisong, had been reached!",

      "content": "Chapter 49: Chapter 49: The Activation of the Falling Pine Catalog - A New Talent! (Four Updates)\nAs expected!\nSensing the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas in his mind, Su Ping’s attention also locked onto one particular section.\nThis unfamiliar Catalog was no longer the Forest Wolf that Su Ping was most familiar with, but rather a tall pine tree. Atop the pine tree hung pinecones, but they were bright red, as if they were about to explode at any moment.\nAlthough undoubtedly a Wood Element Pet Beast, the Luozisong primarily featured wide-ranging offensive abilities. The might of a mature Luozisong could be discerned from this particular Catalog entry.\nAnd almost in the next moment, this originally grey-black Catalog slowly started to be rendered from the top down like a drop of water, gradually revealing a sheen. It was like when he had first made a contract with Xiao Qing, lighting up the Forest Wolf Catalog.\nAlthough it was only a simple Level 1, as long as it could be lit up, one could receive the fundamental reward from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas.\nIndeed, that was exactly what happened.\n[Catalog ’Luozisong’ illuminated, current Catalog Level: 1, fundamental reward obtained: Telepathic Communication]\n[Telepathic Communication (Beast Tamer ability): Allows one to concentrate and use spiritual power to comprehend the meaning of a Pet Beast’s words through mind sensing and to communicate with it.]\nIndeed!\nSu Ping’s eyes brightened; the reward for lighting up a Catalog was still so potent.\nThis talent skill was as commonplace as Eye of Truth, an ability countless Beast Tamers awakened to. However, it must be said, regardless of how mediocre this talent skill might seem, it was indeed handy!\nThere’s no need to elaborate on the effects of Eye of Truth, but with Telepathic Communication, I can communicate more directly and intuitively with my Pet Beasts.\nNo longer will I need to rely solely on my understanding of a Pet Beast to infer the meaning behind its words.\nThe convenience this brings to my cultivation work is unimaginable.\nMoreover, Jin Cheng had actually mentioned before that for ordinary Breeders, the most suitable talent wasn’t anything convoluted, but this simple Telepathic Communication.\nCommunication is the bridge. And communication is also the first step in cultivating Pet Beasts.\nUndoubtedly, with such a talent, the help it will provide me is beyond imagination.\nWithout hurrying to test the effects of this ability, Su Ping had already merged his consciousness with the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, and the newly illuminated Luozisong Catalog appeared completely before his eyes.\n[Catalog: Luozisong]\n[A Wood Attribute plant-type Pet Beast, cumbersome to move, but possesses a ranged attack ability rarely found in Pet Beasts of the same level. Racial Skills: Photosynthesis, Pinecone Cannon, Pine Needle Defense, etc.]\n[Current Catalog Level: 1 (5/500)]\nKnown Evolutionary Atlas, special Cultivation:\n[None discovered yet]\nPreferences, habits:\n[High adaptability to living environments, low demands for sunlight and water sources, but correspondingly slower natural growth rate. A high-quality air spirit spring can somewhat accelerate its growth.]\nRecord Log:\n[Encountered and interacted with a common Luozisong, intimacy met the requirement, Catalogue Experience +5!]\n[Subsequently, each day spent with it, Catalogue Experience +0.5!]\n[Daily, Catalogue Experience is gained based on the number of such creatures one interacts with, their level, and by enhancing the Biological Abilities of creatures that meet the intimacy requirement. This obtained experience allows one to perfect the Catalog and raise its level.]\nThe distribution of the Forest Wolf Catalog was identical to this. However, the entries in its Record Log were much shorter, and the Catalogue Experience gained was pitifully scarce, but this was enough.\nGiven the current situation, I hadn’t intended to cultivate this Luozisong to prominence. Merely activating it to receive the fundamental reward from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas is sufficient.\nAt this thought, Su Ping opened his eyes in satisfaction. He looked at the Luozisong in front of him, which was even more excited.\nThe Luozisong’s body was constantly swaying, \"RUSTLE RUSTLE (new... skills... cannonball... happy...)\"\nThis time, amidst the Luozisong’s swaying and the involuntary RUSTLE RUSTLE sound it made, Su Ping seemed to grasp the meaning behind its words. However, this perception was still exceedingly faint. He didn’t know whether it was because he had just acquired the Telepathic Communication talent, or whether the young Luozisong’s Mental Fluctuation was simply too weak to be caught.\nSu Ping was like a child who had received an amusing toy, suddenly becoming greatly intrigued. He went nonstop to the Forest Wolf’s training area to continue his attempts.\nSu Ping, engrossed in his experimentation, achieved a deeper understanding with the Forest Wolf through Telepathic Communication.Thɪs\nMeanwhile, Li Shu, standing beside the furnace, was on the verge of a breakdown.\nWhen he learned the function of the furnace from Su Ping and what he was to do next, Li Shu was excited.\nBecause before bedtime, during my routine video call check with Dad, I can proudly say that today I finally wasn’t doing customer service, scooping poop, or mowing grass!\nInstead, like a real Breeder, I’m trying my hand at making medicinal herbs, food, or other assorted items for Pet Beasts!\nAnyway, this is a small step on a Breeder’s path of growth, but a giant leap in the significance of my life!\nAnd when he started pounding the medicine with the pestle while controlling the temperature, after five minutes, Li Shu felt something was slightly off, but it was generally acceptable.\nThirty minutes later, he was still pounding. Apart from some soreness in his neck and arms, it was still bearable overall.\nAn hour later, Li Shu, whose arms were trembling from controlling the temperature and wielding the pestle, had lost all anticipation and even secretly hoped it would be over soon.\nTwo and a half hours later, his arms were swollen, and his body was drenched in sweat as if he had been fished out of water. The boiling steam made his head dizzy, and the awful smell of the crushed Wolf Tobacco, which even a gas mask couldn’t completely block, was overpowering.\nThe immense torture, both physical and mental, finally defeated Li Shu, and he fell into a phase of doubting life itself.\nIf the life of a Breeder is like this, then maybe I should consider giving up.\nIs this even humanly doable?\nThis work isn’t meant for humans, is it? It’s definitely for some kind of strength-based, pack-animal Pet Beast, like those mountain-hauling donkeys!\nLi Shu thought, filled with doubt.\nObviously, if this task were so easy, Su Ping wouldn’t be drooling over those three hundred million worth of equipment sent by Vice President Liu.\nAlthough a Beast Tamer’s rank progression does enhance the body and improve endurance, it mainly centers around the enhancement of one’s spiritual power and the Beast Taming Space. Those with strong physical strength were indeed a minority. And Li Shu, who was merely an ordinary Second Rank Beast Tamer, obviously wasn’t up to the task.\nHowever, even with reluctance, seeing the stinking liquid that was starting to thicken in the furnace after heating, Li Shu could only forcibly continue brandishing the pestle and embark on the final phase that was even more torturous than the labor of a load-bearing donkey.",

      "content": "Chapter 50: Chapter 50 Old Sha’s Warning, The Arrival of a Strange Pet Beast? (First Update)\nLi Shu had run away.\nOf course, officially, he was just going back to rest for a while. After all, he had been with Su Ping for over a week, and it was time to return home.\nSu Ping felt somewhat regretful; such good help was truly hard to find.\nBut this was also normal.\nHow was it easy to become a Breeder? If he hadn’t grown up with the Forest Wolves at his family’s Cultivation base and possessed a cheat-like ability, wanting to become a Breeder would have been an extremely difficult feat.\nWhen Li Shu’s father, Li Senlin, arrived, he was extremely courteous and even wanted to give Su Ping a hefty red envelope, which Su Ping declined.Thɪs NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nHe had a good relationship with Li Shu. Since Li Shu had helped him for so many days, and even though Su Ping had also helped upgrade Luozisong’s Level and even taught it the Pinecone Bomb Skill, he had also gained what he wanted. This was already enough, which made Li Senlin quite embarrassed.\nLi Shu’s departure didn’t affect Su Ping too much.\nAlthough he now needed to answer the phone and receive customers himself, the busiest period had already passed. Those Pet Beasts confirmed for Cultivation had their deposits paid, and they had started queuing for Cultivation.\nThe Heart of Woods, after an initial few days of disarray, had barely managed to get on the right track.\nHowever, Su Ping did acknowledge Li Shu’s efforts.\nNo wonder the kid was exhausted. A large bundle of Wolf Tobacco had been stirred for an entire afternoon. After several hours of refinement, it had transformed into this bucket of dark green liquid, emitting an indescribably foul and peculiar smell. Even Su Ping, when faced with this concoction, wanted to keep his distance.\nNevertheless, an experiment was still an experiment. Despite feeling repulsed, Su Ping carried it out.\nHaving witnessed the effects of this Wolf Tobacco—and not just its benefits—Su Ping naturally couldn’t use his own Forest Wolves as test subjects. Instead, he directly bought several mice for experimentation.\nThe result left him speechless. The mice not only showed no aversion but, being rodents, actually seemed to quite like it. However, after consuming it, there was absolutely no change or difference in them. In fact, after being fed for two days, they had even gotten fatter.\nThis left Su Ping somewhat speechless. However, as previously mentioned, he couldn’t use his own Forest Wolves as test subjects, nor was he extravagant enough to buy a wolf-type Pet Beast just for experimentation. The Wolf Tobacco experiment could only be temporarily shelved until conditions allowed for it to resume in the future.\nAfter Li Shu left, Su Ping’s actions were no longer constrained.\nOver the past few days, he had not only completed the Cultivation of the Pet Beast Forest Wolves, resulting in 10,000,000 credited to his account, but after deducting taxes, he was left with a hefty sum of nearly 9,000,000.\nIt was just a pity that such a large sum of money could no longer stir Su Ping’s heartstrings. The absurd 300,000,000 price tag for a single piece of laboratory equipment that Vice President Liu had mentioned made Su Ping realize that in the field of Pet Beast Cultivation, this amount of money truly wasn’t much.\nMeanwhile, aside from Woodhead, all twenty-five Forest Wolves, plus his own Xiao Qing, making a total of twenty-six Forest Wolves, had completed the Heart of Woods Cultivation process!\nWhat did this entail? The implications were self-evident.\nAlthough they had all completed their Skill development simultaneously, Su Ping knew that this was just the beginning.\nThe unique cooperative combat style of the Pet Beasts belonging to the Zhang Wen and Zhang Wu brothers had given Su Ping a new direction and method for Cultivation. The combat of his Contracted Beasts was one aspect. However, if possible, he also wanted to train these Pet Beasts in group combat.\nGenerally, a Beast Tamer’s primary focus was on their Contracted Beasts. The reason was simple: ordinary Beast Tamers couldn’t carry too many wild Pet Beasts.\nBut Su Ping was different. He possessed the Pet Beast Home Talent. As long as the Pet Beasts were not a higher Level than himself and could fit into his Beast Taming Space, he could take them with him. Under such circumstances, coupled with the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas enhancing his affinity with and control over these Pet Beasts, he could definitely try to forge a different path as a Beast Tamer.\nHowever, training methods for group combat were relatively difficult. Su Ping had been actively searching for training methods during this period.\nWhat was slightly regrettable was that the Zhang Wen and Zhang Wu brothers hadn’t come by since that one time. He wasn’t sure if their family disapproved of such expensive training or if there was some other reason, which Su Ping found somewhat disappointing. If possible, he truly wanted to learn.\nHowever, right now, he faced another matter.\n「Nighttime.」\nSu Ping had never found the time to visit the Lingxi River area behind the forest before.\nGone were the sunny days with their lush green grass and the healing beauty of the flowing river. Instead, it felt rather eerie. The swaying of the trees and grass created an illusion of ghostly shadows stirring.\nSu Ping stood there, with Old Sha and Xiao Qing by his side.\n\"Is it here?\" Su Ping asked softly.\nOld Sha, extremely vigilant, scanned the surroundings. Hearing his young master’s question, he didn’t make a sound but simply nodded.\nOver the past few days, the pack’s Forest Wolves had made leaps and bounds in their training, and their Skills had improved quite rapidly. In fact, the Vine Strangling Skill, one of the primary Cultivation Skills, of the Elite Ninth Order Forest Wolf had even advanced to the Mastery Level. The effects of Telepathic Communication allowed Su Ping to address the Forest Wolves’ needs more precisely, which was a great boon for their Cultivation.\nHowever, he had also come to understand Old Sha’s warnings better. Previously, Old Sha had been highly vigilant regarding the Lingxi River. Initially, Su Ping thought Old Sha’s senses might be mistaken or that occasionally some Advanced Level aquatic Pet Beasts had managed to break through from the Lingxi River and evolve. Such aquatic Pet Beasts, even if they lurked, rarely attacked creatures on the shore.\nHowever, after acquiring the Telepathic Communication Talent, Su Ping could more directly understand and interpret Old Sha’s feedback. Only then did he grasp what Old Sha truly meant.\nOver the past few nights, a strange presence had appeared on the banks of the Lingxi River, right in their backyard?!\nSu Ping had to take this seriously. If some undetected Pet Beast had truly arrived, any trouble or disturbance it caused would be a huge problem.\nHowever, even after waiting for a full hour, apart from getting a bit cold from the night breeze, they didn’t see so much as a hair. Even Old Sha, facing Su Ping’s skeptical gaze, visibly showed some embarrassment and surprise—this old wolf was nearly twice Su Ping’s age.\nYet, just at that moment, suddenly, in the distance of the Lingxi River, a ripple, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, appeared.\nThe next moment, a tiny figure emerged from it.\nSu Ping hadn’t even clearly seen what it was, only catching a glimpse of something snow-white in the moonlight, when Old Sha had already lunged forward!",

      "content": "Chapter 51: Chapter 51: Paperman, Metal Element and Space Element? (Second Half)\n\"Old Sha, don’t hurt it!\" Su Ping called out softly.\nOnce the figure appeared, Su Ping sensed that its strength probably wasn’t very high. Although the strength of a Pet Beast isn’t necessarily related to its size, this creature under the moonlight, only as tall as an adult’s calf, didn’t seem to pose any threat at all.\nAnd facing Old Sha’s arrival, the figure showed no signs of nervousness or fear. It merely retreated a few steps and adopted a very peculiar stance, its hands placed at its waist, its body slightly lowered, poised for action.\nHearing Su Ping’s call, Old Sha also reined in his charge somewhat, but his eyes, shining green in the dark moonlight, remained firmly locked on the little creature before him.\nAt this moment, Su Ping could finally make out what it was under the dim moonlight.\nIt had a tiny stature and a frail, exceedingly pale body that looked as if a gust of wind could blow it away. Folds and marks, painted facial features, and the so-called clothes all confirmed the creature’s identity: it was a Paperman.\nIndeed, from head to toe, its body lacked any semblance of flesh and blood. It wasn’t a Spiritual Body of the Undead Elemental type, nor was it a bony skeleton. It looked as if it were crafted with exquisite origami techniques. Even its cheeks had blush painted on them, giving it an eerie appearance.\nOrdinary Level Undead Pet Beast: Paperman. Reputed to be the shame of the Necromancy System, it competed with the Skeleton Soldier for the title of the weakest Undead Pet Beast.\nHowever, as weak as Skeleton Soldiers might be, with their race’s potential generally capped at the Ordinary Tier, they boasted a vast array of evolution pathways! As the most common Undead Pet Beast, Skeleton Soldiers have various evolutions like Skeleton Archers and Skeleton Warriors. They even have a Commander Level evolution path to Skeleton General, and legendary King Level evolution paths such as Bone Tyrant, or even the mythical Emperor Level ’Lord of Death’.\nAlthough Papermen also had a few developed evolutionary paths, their fame and practicality clearly fell short of the Skeleton Soldier’s effectiveness.\nSu Ping had never imagined that the ’guest’ in the backyard, the one that had kept Old Sha on edge for days, was actually such a little thing!\nʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\nThis brought him a wave of relief, but also a twinge of disappointment.\nHe’d thought there might be some unexpected surprise! But this was it?\nHowever, in the hazy moonlight, Su Ping quickly noticed that this little Paperman was a bit different from the normal ones. Apart from its unremarkable height, what was slightly noteworthy was the posture this little Paperman was currently adopting.\nIt was bending slightly, its inverted-triangle eyes, drawn with black paint, staring intently yet blankly at Old Sha. Both of its papery hands were placed on its left hip, as if clutching something.\nClutching something?\nSu Ping squinted. After getting a clear look, he couldn’t help but feel a mix of amusement and exasperation. It was the hilt and scabbard of some weapon, though whether it was a knife or a sword was indiscernible.\nThe Paperman’s main ability was that its body could take on many different forms by reconfiguring its folds. Its methods of attack were similar, and this was the first time Su Ping had seen such a little Paperman.\nOf course, Su Ping wouldn’t dare to be careless or underestimate it. The simple reason was that he still hadn’t figured out how this little Paperman had appeared just now.\n\"Old Sha, don’t act rashly!\"\nAfter instructing Old Sha, Su Ping slowly approached; he really wanted to get a good look and see what kind of secret this little Paperman held.\nWith that in mind, he slowly began to manifest his Eye of Truth.\nHowever, the instant he got close enough to use his Eye of Truth, a fierce glint seemed to flash from the little Paperman before him:\n\"WAAH!\"\nA strange cry erupted. Before Su Ping even had time to react, this little thing, barely as tall as his calf, actually moved!\nAn indescribably sharp force shot out from its waist, instantly severing the Wolf Tobacco plants in front of it and creating a crescent-shaped vacuum.\nYet, Old Sha was faster.\nOld Sha leaped directly in front of Su Ping. A wall of vines shot up, blocking the strike.\nBANG! The sound was particularly harsh in the dead of night.\nHowever, just as Old Sha let out an angry howl at the moon, and the wall of vines switched from defense to offense, about to envelop the little Paperman—\nThe Paperman’s figure rippled, seeming to dissolve into the air, and vanished without a trace!\nJust as it had appeared, its disappearance was utterly without warning.\nWhat was going on?\nSu Ping blinked. Old Sha rushed to where the little Paperman had just vanished, circling it repeatedly and scanning a full 360 degrees, but found nothing out of the ordinary.\nThe pale moonlight shone down, and Su Ping remained motionless.\nHe still hadn’t recovered from the shock of that attack. Its power was too great, far surpassing his understanding of Papermen as Pet Beasts.\nAnd, if his basic Beast Tamer knowledge wasn’t mistaken, that attack... was it a Metal Element Skill?\nBut did Papermen, as a type of Pet Beast, even possess Metal Element attacks? Obviously not. If they did, Papermen wouldn’t be considered the shame of the Necromancy System and the weakest of the Undead Pet Beasts by the entire Beast Tamer community.\nThen there was its sudden disappearance. While Su Ping had never witnessed such a thing firsthand, he understood the principle behind it. That was a Space Element ability!\nA Paperman possessing Metal Element abilities was already peculiar and outlandish enough. How could it possibly have Space Element abilities too?\nYet, the evidence was right before Su Ping’s eyes. The mark left by that attack was still on the ground.\nUnfortunately, his Eye of Truth hadn’t managed to capture the Paperman’s specific details just then.\nNevertheless, Su Ping could tell from its keen defensive awareness and strong offensive intent that this Paperman was probably not a Beast Tamer’s Contracted Beast, but a purely wild one.\nBut such a bizarre Paperman couldn’t possibly have wandered into Linzhou City from the wilds, could it? And those strange spatial fluctuations...\nSuddenly, Su Ping felt like he understood something. A few days ago, Qin Xiaoxue had mentioned that Dong Muyun, the chairman of Tianyun Group, supposedly had a Space Element Pet Beast, hadn’t she? This situation right now...?\nSu Ping’s brows furrowed even tighter. He suddenly began to understand why Tianyun Group might be in such a rush to buy his family’s plot of land.\nClearly, this was most likely related to the current situation. But what exactly was happening?",

(Three More)\nNighttime.\nTossing and turning, unable to sleep, Su Ping finally sat up in bed.\nAlthough he had some experience from his past and current lives, what happened tonight was simply too bizarre.\nHe was also certain that the Paperman had mutated. Otherwise, why would it have Metal Element abilities?\nBut compared to that spatial ripple, the possibly mutated little Paperman didn’t seem like much.\nWhat on earth was that thing?\nSo, unable to sleep and finding no answers online, Su Ping picked up his phone and dialed a number.\nIt was neither Qin Xiaoxue nor anyone else, but the person closest to him in this world—bar none: his own father, Su Anyong.\nEver since his dad went to Beihai City, he’d occasionally send a message to say hello, with no further contact. It was as if Su Anyong had forgotten he had such a son and his own family business.\nHowever, after so many years, Su Ping had long grown accustomed to his unreliable old man.\nBut regarding today’s events and their connection to the Tianyun Group, Su Ping really didn’t know where to begin.\nUnfortunately, the phone rang for a full minute with no answer. Anyone else might have assumed the person was asleep, or perhaps that something dangerous had happened. But Su Ping clearly wasn’t worried. After a short while, though no call came through, a message did.\nSu Anyong: [What’s up?]\nSu Ping: [Can’t we talk on the phone?]\nSu Anyong: [Not convenient.]\nSu Ping: [?]\nSu Anyong: [She just fell asleep. Waking her would be bad.]\nSu Ping: [Nice.]\nSu Ping: [So you really went and found me a stepmom?]\nSu Anyong: [Nonsense! Your Second Uncle found a reliable one this time, and she’s a wealthy widow! Once your old man has money, just tell me whatever you want to buy!]\nReading the message from his father, Su Ping felt suspicious.\nIs this for real?\nAfter all, even though his father was unreliable, Su Ping didn’t recall him being the type to fool around. But seeing his confident tone, Su Ping didn’t hold back.\nSu Ping: [At the Breeder Association, there’s a Mechanical Core Compression Extractor. Our family’s old medicine furnace should have been retired long ago. I want to replace it. It’s not expensive, just three hundred million.]\nSu Anyong: [?]\nSu Anyong: [Kid, aren’t you afraid that thing will shorten your lifespan? Besides, you’re not a Breeder. Why buy it?]\nSu Ping: [Who says I’m not a Breeder? I’m now an Intermediate Level Breeder specializing in Forest Wolves, certified by the Jianghai Province Breeders Association, and I’ve mastered Wood Heart Skill cultivation! A vice-president personally delivered my certificate! Su Anyong, for your son’s path to becoming a Breeding Master, it’s time to invest. The future returns are unimaginable!]\nSu Anyong: [Alright, alright, an Intermediate Level Breeder, huh? On the path to becoming a Breeding Master, huh? Mastered Wood Heart Skill cultivation, huh? A vice-president personally delivered it, huh? You’re wrong! A vice-president isn’t enough. It should be the president of the Imperial Capital Breeder Association who delivers it to match my son’s talent and abilities!]\nSu Ping: [Indeed. To think we father and son are on the same page. But it’s fine. There will be opportunities in the future.]\nSu Anyong: [You little rascal, now you’re even pulling my leg! Just wait until I get back. I’ll have you show off in front of your grandfather. We’ll see if the old man’s lifetime wish being fulfilled by his grandson will make him come back to life just to drag you down to the underworld to show off properly!]\nSu Ping: [I’m serious! Also, there’s something else I need to tell you.]\nSu Anyong: [Whatever it is, we’ll talk later. Damn, she woke up again! My poor back... Not talking now. I’ll be back in a while. Take care of the house.]\nHe watched speechlessly as the last message came in, and Su Anyong’s profile picture turned gray.\nSu Ping was speechless.\nHe knew it. Three sentences into a conversation with this old guy, and he’d be led astray. Sure enough, he hadn’t managed to discuss any serious matters, nor even successfully show off to Su Anyong.\nNow he even had to worry that his father might accidentally bring home a half-brother or half-sister for him.\nDamn it!\nSu Ping, already burdened with complex emotions, found it even harder to fall asleep.\nIf I can’t sleep, I’ll go train! I’ll go meditate!\nAs long as my own strength is great enough, all obstacles will cease to exist.\n「Late that night」\nSu Ping stood at the edge of the forest. Clearly, he had come out because he couldn’t sleep and was curious about the results of the little one’s training that day.\nBy this time, all the wolf packs had also ceased their training, but they had not yet dispersed\nInnumerable vines were entwined on the ground, and large pits were scattered everywhere, testament to the Forest Wolves’ training results over the past few days.\nQin Xiaoxue’s Woodhead was among them. Although Woodhead’s Self-Healing ability had reached the standard, its innate Talent was also exceptionally good. As a member of the shared-link training, its excellent Talent also helped the other Forest Wolves when they practiced Skills. This allowed the other Forest Wolves to achieve breakthroughs faster.\nUnfortunately, during this time, Su Ping had been busy researching Wolf Tobacco and breeding matters, and had somewhat neglected his own meditation, so his Realm had not improved.\nHowever, it was worth mentioning that after all this time, Xiao Qing’s own Realm Level had once again caught up with Su Ping’s Realm. It had reached the common Seventh Rank.\nThe reason was simple: in the past few days, after Xiao Qing had fully digested the effects of its last consumption, Su Ping had it consume another Poison System Resource. A Heartbane Fruit.\nThe effects of this consumption were good. After swallowing it, Xiao Qing’s Realm had risen by one Level. Although its Poison Vine Strangulation Skill had not leveled up this time, experiments with San Ha—the only Forest Wolf in Su Ping’s pack that had upgraded its Self-Healing Skill to Master Level—had shown that the toxicity of Xiao Qing’s Poison Vine Strangulation had further increased.\nAt the same time, the experience cost for the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas to analyze Poison Type mutations had also decreased further.\nAnd it was during Su Ping’s patrol that he suddenly paused, his gaze turning toward one of the Forest Wolves. This Forest Wolf was none other than Qin Xiaoxue’s Woodhead.\nAt this moment, there was something not quite right about Woodhead’s state. Even at night, green specks of light seemed to swirl around its body, like encircling fireflies. At this moment, Woodhead seemed as though it truly belonged to this forest, as if the grass and trees were calling out to it. This sense of profound connection with its surroundings made Su Ping keenly aware that Woodhead had made special progress. Indeed, it had.\nThe Eye of Truth activated instantly.\nSu Ping quickly saw what had happened to this Forest Wolf—a top-tier specimen belonging to a wealthy scion—that had stayed at his home for the better part of half a month:\n[Heart of Woods (Proficiency)]\nSeeing the Heart of Woods Skill increase to Proficiency, Su Ping knew he couldn’t keep Woodhead any longer!\nI have to notify Qin Xiaoxue to come and pick up her wolf!\nOtherwise, if it suddenly masters another Skill, it’ll be hard to explain.",

      "content": "Chapter 53: Chapter 53: Fifteen Days of Torment! The Final Result! (Four more)\nShuhua City.\nIn the urban area lay a Pet Beast Breeding Base covering an enormous area.\nAbove the main entrance, two large characters shone brilliantly:\nWolf Den!\nNext to this signboard stood an impressive sculpture of a Forest Wolf, a massive five meters tall, exuding valor and majesty. Anyone passing by couldn’t help but look on with envy.\nThis was the largest Forest Wolf breeding base in Shuhua City. Its owner was Sun Chaoju, an Intermediate Breeder and a student of Liu Fuhai, the vice president of the Jianghai Province Breeders Association. An Intermediate Breeder—such a status and ability commanded respect from anyone. In Jianghai Province, he was definitely a person of importance.\nHowever, at this very moment, this renowned Sun Cultivator, who had made quite a name for himself, hadn’t been eating or sleeping well for the past few days. The deadline for the bet he’d made with Su Ping and Qin Xiaoxue was drawing ever closer. Although Sun Chaoju had good composure, it was unrealistic to expect him to remain completely unruffled by a gamble of this magnitude.\nDuring this period, Sun Chaoju had been paying relentless attention to the Heart of Woods Pet Beast Breeding Base. After becoming an Intermediate Breeder and being registered by the Breeder Association, the constant stream of customers seeking Cultivation didn’t surprise Sun Chaoju. In fact, some of his own people were even among them. Nevertheless, Sun Chaoju refrained from resorting to any underhanded tactics or competition; his teacher had warned him once before. He simply wanted to see if Su Ping’s abilities and success rates were truly as high as he claimed.\nSuch high success rates!\nHowever, the outcome was beyond his wildest expectations. This kid only took in one customer per week for Cultivation, which was understandable; the five million price tag was also fairly reasonable. But what he hadn’t expected was that, over these past few days, only two Beast Tamers had sought Cultivation, and both attempts had been successful!\nThis made Sun Chaoju both thrilled and anxious. Thrilled, because if he could obtain such Cultivation techniques, his own Wolf Den would undoubtedly achieve further advancements! Anxious, because if Su Ping truly possessed such bizarre abilities and methods, did that mean he was genuinely capable?\nWas he truly able to improve the Self-Healing Skill of Qin Xiaoxue’s Forest Wolf, Woodhead, from Beginner to Proficient Level within a mere fifteen days?\nOf course, this thought only flickered through his mind for an instant before he cast it aside.\nIn fact, if it had been any other skill of Qin Xiaoxue’s Pet Beast that needed enhancement, Sun Chaoju would have felt genuinely uneasy. After all, someone of Qin Xiaoxue’s status wouldn’t choose anything but the best Pet Beasts. Moreover, with Miss Qin’s previous training, the Pet Beast might have been just a step away from a breakthrough in its skill level!\nBut for Woodhead, it was the Self-Healing Skill that needed Cultivation!\nFirstly, Sun Chaoju had reason to believe that even with Miss Qin’s thorough training of the Forest Wolf, including multiple instances of practical combat, its training in Self-Healing was likely still unsatisfactory.\nAfter all, how many people could actually manage to injure Miss Qin’s Pet Beast?\nA little thought made it clear that such an occurrence was highly improbable. Indeed, that was the case; otherwise, Woodhead’s Self-Healing Skill wouldn’t still be at entry-level even after reaching the Elite Tenth Stage.\nSecondly, and most importantly, as an Intermediate Breeder specializing in Forest Wolves, Sun Chaoju knew all too well which Forest Wolf skills were the hardest to improve. Apart from skills acquired later, among the Forest Wolf’s innate skills, Self-Healing and Sunlight Absorption were the two most difficult to enhance. Sunlight Absorption was easy to improve in the initial stages, but becoming Proficient in it, much less achieving Perfection, was extremely rare. It was generally not something a Breeder could cultivate to such a high level, much less to Perfection. The same went for Self-Healing.\nAmong the derivative attributes of the Wood Element, the most formidable was naturally the Life Series attribute. As a relatively rare attribute, the Life Series attribute might not be as directly powerful as the Psychic Element, Space Element, or even Time Series, but it was definitely a rare attribute. Ultimately, the Forest Wolf was a pure Wood Element Pet Beast. However, the Self-Healing Skill was a Racial Skill born from the Life Series attribute. This meant that compared to skills like Vine Strangling or Accelerated Growth, the cultivation of the Self-Healing ability fell within the domain of the Life Series.\nUnder these two conditions, Sun Chaoju truly couldn’t believe that Su Ping could train Miss Qin’s Woodhead to the Proficient Level from scratch within fifteen days!\nWhat a joke! What is skill level Cultivation? Child’s play?\nThus, as time marched on and the deadline drew nearer day by day, the excitement and agitation in Sun Chaoju’s heart grew harder to contain. The closer the fifteen-day limit approached, the greater he felt his chances of winning the bet became. However, it was precisely because of this that Sun Chaoju felt even more helpless. After all, when the bet was made, his own teacher had said that even if he genuinely lost, he would have to hand over his Accelerated Casting technique to the other party.\nTo be honest, Sun Chaoju wasn’t overly concerned about the incomplete Evolution Method for the Wanmu Wolf.\nBecause only he knew just how flawed that thing was.\nDeveloping the Wanmu Wolf’s Evolution Method was like trying to fill a bottomless pit. Forget Su Ping, who was only an Intermediate Breeder; even for a Senior Breeder like his teacher, successfully developing it would likely be extremely difficult.\nBut Accelerated Casting was different. This was the cornerstone of his Wolf Den Pet Beast Breeding Base. It was a Secret Technique for Cultivation that couldn’t even be exchanged within the Breeder Association.\nAlthough he was confident that without his guidance, Su Ping would find it difficult to fully master it to the same degree as him, what if he did?\nNo! There could be no ’what ifs’!\nWith that thought, Sun Chaoju shivered involuntarily.\nWhat was I thinking? Why was I bolstering someone else’s prestige and diminishing my own morale?\nWith the fifteen-day deadline just a couple of days away, as long as he could endure these last excruciating days, he would undoubtedly get his hands on the Cultivation method of the Heart of Woods! By then, the Wolf Den’s reputation and profits would soar to unimaginable heights!\nThinking this, Sun Chaoju let out a slight sigh of relief. However, at that very moment, his phone suddenly rang.\nHe looked down, and his eyebrows shot up.\nCaller ID: Teacher Liu.\nThe arrival of this call at such a time, for some reason, sparked a rather unpleasant premonition in Sun Chaoju’s heart.Follow current novels on NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nHe cautiously answered the call, \"Hello?\"\nHowever, quite rapidly, the latest model mechanical smartphone in the hands of the locally renowned Sun Cultivator slipped from his grasp, THUDDING onto the ground.\nIt shattered into pieces.",

      "content": "Chapter 54: Chapter 54: Sun Chaoju Accepts His Loss with Conviction and Satisfaction! (First Update)\nBefore returning to the vast breeding base in the suburbs of Linzhou, Vice President Liu and Sun Chaoju wore different expressions; the former was just slightly sentimental, while the latter’s was pitch-black.\nSun Chaoju would have never imagined that, as the fifteen-day deadline neared, this young man had actually achieved it.\nWhen they got out of the car, both men were slightly startled. Qin Xiaoxue was standing at the entrance waiting for them, her face blooming with a smile, unable to contain her excitement and joy.\nWhen had either of them ever seen such an expression on Miss Qin’s face?\nThey were also a bit doubtful. Just reaching Proficient Level in Self-Healing—was that worth such excitement?\nHowever, her current attitude clearly showed just how satisfied Miss Qin was with Su Ping’s cultivation.\n\"Grandpa Liu, Breeder Sun, you’re here! Come in quickly, Su Ping is waiting for you.\"\nVice President Liu looked incredulously at Qin Xiaoxue. Having known this girl for so long, it was the first time he had heard the term ’Grandpa Liu’ from her.\nHe subconsciously glanced at the sky. Had the sun risen from the west? Otherwise, how could such an unbelievable thing be happening?\nNevertheless, Vice President Liu was also curious about what exactly had happened to make Miss Qin so delighted.\nTogether with a silent Sun Chaoju, they walked into the reception room. Su Ping, whom they hadn’t seen for over ten days, was half-kneeling there, combing the fur on Woodhead’s neck.\nAnd Woodhead, the proud Forest Wolf who had looked down on everyone just half a month ago, was now comfortably lying on the ground. His eyes were narrowed, his tongue was lolling out, and his limbs were curled towards the sky, exposing his belly for Su Ping to handle as he pleased.\nThis posture stunned both Sun Chaoju and Vice President Liu.\nWhat kind of magic did this young man possess? Not only had he appeased Miss Qin, but he had also tamed this Forest Wolf, making it as docile as a house dog instead of a ferocious beast.\nHowever, it was evident that, at this moment, Sun Chaoju was the most impatient one among them.\nWithout a second thought, his eyes focused intently on Woodhead.\nFeeling the fluctuation of the Eye of Truth, Woodhead glanced at him but paid him no further attention, continuing to pant heavily with his tongue lolling out.\nHowever, just one glance was enough to leave Sun Chaoju petrified.\nOnly then did Su Ping look up, put the comb aside, and sit down with a smile. \"Breeder Sun, are you ready to admit defeat?\"The source of thɪs content is ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nSun Chaoju opened his mouth.\nHe desperately wanted to deny it. In fact, on his way there, he had already concocted excuses:\nMiss Qin’s Forest Wolf Pet Beast naturally has the best talent! Its successful cultivation wasn’t because Su Ping was so capable, but because Woodhead’s talent was high enough! Maybe Woodhead’s Self-Healing was already on the verge of a breakthrough, and just a little training was all that was needed for it to advance, as simple as pushing a boat with the current.\nBut now, in this reception room, he couldn’t bring himself to utter a single word of those excuses.\nMoreover, the young man before him suddenly didn’t seem so detestable anymore.\nAfter all, people don’t often express strong emotions towards those who are far beyond their reach.\nAt this moment, he finally began to understand why his teacher had said those words.\nWhen faced with true genius, reasoning often falls short.\nAnd the Su Ping before him had utterly conquered Sun Chaoju.\nFacing Su Ping’s smile, which seemed somewhat challenging, Sun Chaoju took a deep breath. Then, to the surprise of both Su Ping and Qin Xiaoxue, he actually nodded. \"A bet is a bet, and I admit defeat! I’m thoroughly convinced! Su Ping, you are the most incredible young Breeder I have ever met!\"\nThese words of sincere admiration made Su Ping feel somewhat embarrassed.\nBut Sun Chaoju paid no mind to that.\nActually, there wasn’t much direct business competition between the Wolf Den breeding base and services related to the Heart of Woods skill, aside from matters involving Qin Xiaoxue. Plus, Shuhua City was quite a distance from Linzhou. While there might be some impact, it wouldn’t be significant.\nSo, at this moment, after seeing Woodhead’s current state, Sun Chaoju knew that something like ’Accelerated Spellcasting’ might truly be, as his teacher had said, not that important for Su Ping’s future.\nOne must have foresight and look to the long term.\nAnd that was precisely what Sun Chaoju was considering now.\nIt couldn’t be helped; the words \"Proficient Level\" displayed for the skills in the Eye of Truth’s feedback on Woodhead were simply too glaring!\nIn just over ten days!\nNot only had Self-Healing reached Proficient Level, but even the newly cultivated Heart of Woods skill had also reached Proficiency!\nSuch a level of cultivation expertise, and such natural control and affinity for Forest Wolves—Sun Chaoju had already lost any desire to compete.\nOn his way here, he had been resentful, indignant, and even held some grudges. But now, seeing the feedback from the Eye of Truth, all those feelings had vanished, replaced entirely by sheer astonishment at the young man before him.\nHe even extended his hand, placed a USB drive directly on the coffee table in the reception room, and looked at the somewhat astonished Su Ping, who hadn’t yet reacted. Sun Chaoju said, \"Inside this is the cultivation method for ’Accelerated Spellcasting,’ the incomplete evolution methods for the Wanmu Wolf, and some data I’ve compiled from my research on its evolution. It’s all yours! If you’re worried, you can have Teacher Liu or President Qin verify it first.\"\nSu Ping looked at the USB drive, then back at Sun Chaoju, genuinely startled.\nSetting aside everything else, judging from Sun Chaoju’s words, the research he’d conducted on the Wanmu Wolf’s evolution must have cost him an unimaginable amount. And now he was just handing it all over?\nSeeing Su Ping’s astonishment, this time it was Sun Chaoju who felt a surge of pride.\nYou brat, did you really think that just because I could become Vice President Liu’s disciple and own such a large breeding base, I’d be a petty and vengeful person? A fool with no foresight? An idiot with no strategic sense?\nWith this thought, Sun Chaoju, now feeling as if he were cloaked in a holy light, added, \"Regarding the research on the Wanmu Wolf’s evolution, if you need anything, you can call me. I might not be able to offer much direct help, but I can provide some Forest Wolf test subjects for evolutionary attempts.\"\nAt that moment, Su Ping finally recovered, looking at Breeder Sun with some amazement.\nWhether Sun Chaoju wanted to invest, repair their relationship, or simply bet on Su Ping’s future ability to develop a complete evolution method for the Wanmu Wolf (thereby getting his own name on the list of developers), as long as it wasn’t all for show, then this Sun Chaoju had genuinely changed Su Ping’s impression of him, making him more willing to interact.\nAfter all, anyone still passionate about pursuing the path of a Breeder and enthusiastic about the Pet Beast cultivation industry inevitably possessed admirable qualities.\nIt was for this very reason that Dragon Nation had thrived over the past century. Numerous Pet Beast evolution and cultivation breakthroughs had blossomed like a hundred flowers, greatly strengthening the overall national power and allowing Dragon Nation to once again become one of the largest countries on Blue Star.\nThus, facing the expectant gazes before him, Su Ping also nodded with a smile. \"Alright.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 55: Chapter 55: Secret Realm? Qin Xiaoxue’s Departure and Promise! (Second Update)\nSun Chaoju and President Liu did not stay for long. After a brief chat about the Forest Wolf’s cultivation, they left. Vice President Liu, before departing, reminded Su Ping not to forget to attend his lecture when the time came.\nSu Ping also inquired about the specific time and confirmed his attendance.\nVice President Liu was a Senior Breeder skilled in wolf-type Pet Beasts, and such Breeders were not plentiful in the Dragon Nation. They were all figures renowned in their own right. Learning more about his theories would only benefit Su Ping’s study of Pet Beast cultivation, with no drawbacks.\nQin Xiaoxue, on the other hand, was not in a rush to leave. It wasn’t until the other two had departed that she patted Su Ping on the shoulder.\n\"Good lad! You’ve really made me proud this time! Those two old chaps were so distrustful at first, they almost told me to my face I’d been swindled. Seeing them like this now is just delightful!\"\nIt was clear that Qin Xiaoxue was indeed very happy today.\nHowever, Su Ping didn’t rush off to meticulously study Accelerated Casting and Woodhead’s Evolution methods. He stayed, clearly having some business with Qin Xiaoxue.\nHe didn’t ask directly but instead said with a smile, \"Now that I have Accelerated Casting, I’m quite confident. How about leaving Woodhead with me a bit longer? I can cultivate that Skill for him too.\"\nHis confident inquiry was met with a refusal from Qin Xiaoxue. \"No need. Summer break is almost over, and I’ll be tidying up to return to Magic Capital in a couple of days.\"\nUpon hearing this, even Su Ping was taken aback.\nAfter all, he had grown accustomed to having Qin Xiaoxue around during the past half-month.\nBut he quickly gave a light smile. \"Well then, have a smooth journey, and don’t forget to message me when you get to Magic Capital.\"\nIt was Qin Xiaoxue, however, who turned her head and gave him an odd look, before seemingly explaining as she continued, \"Actually, the purpose of Woodhead learning so many Skills was indeed for his Evolution. The Evolution path of the Crown Wolf Emperor requires a Forest Wolf to master eight Skills before the initial cultivation plan for Evolution can begin! Thanks to you, we’ve finally achieved this!\"\n\"Crown Wolf Emperor?\"\nThis was an Evolution path Su Ping had never heard of before.\nQin Xiaoxue did not withhold any information. \"Yes, it’s a Pet Beast with the Racial Potential to reach Emperor Level. But given the name, you should be able to guess.\"\nSaying this, Qin Xiaoxue spoke with some regret, \"It’s a pity your Xiao Qing has a mutated bloodline; otherwise, he could also try this path. The old lady still has some stock of the Heart of Woods and the Thorny Crown. If you come to Magic Capital’s Beast Taming Academy, with my connections, trying this Evolution path wouldn’t be a problem.\"\nHeart of Woods?\nThorny Crown?\nSu Ping did not know what the latter was. But he did know the former.\nIt was an Emperor Level Peak resource of the Wood Element, with a value beyond imagination. In the mobile app’s marketplace, materials of this Level were not sold publicly; there was no price set for them.\nSu Ping pursed his lips, suppressing the complex emotions rising within him. He could only offer a faint smile. \"I believe Xiao Qing’s future development and Evolution will be no less impressive than Woodhead’s!\"\n\"AWOO!\" Xiao Qing, who had come out to his side, howled in agreement.\nStrong... Evolve...\nWoodhead, however, merely glanced at this little brother, Xiao Qing, uninterested. Now at Elite Peak, Woodhead was wiser than Xiao Qing and naturally understood he would soon part ways with Su Ping. Therefore, reluctant to leave, he didn’t want to argue about such trifles.\n\"By the way, when Woodhead evolves in the future, can I watch in person?\" Su Ping seemed to have thought of something and suddenly asked.\nQin Xiaoxue naturally nodded in agreement. \"No problem. You can come over then, or I might find some time to return to Linzhou.\"\nAs she said this, Qin Xiaoxue suddenly added without any particular reason, \"By the way, your Talent is Pet Beast Home, right?\"\nSu Ping nodded. \"What about it?\"\n\"Nothing.\"\nQin Xiaoxue didn’t elaborate, and Su Ping didn’t inquire further. The pleasantries were over, and it was time to discuss serious matters.\n\"I think I know why Dong Muyun wants to acquire my family’s business,\" Su Ping said.\nUpon hearing this, Qin Xiaoxue abruptly turned her head to look at him. \"What reason?\"\nUnable to contact his unreliable father, and among all the people he knew, it was indeed Qin Xiaoxue, whom he had only known for a little over ten days, that Su Ping could trust the most.\nSu Ping didn’t conceal anything and recounted last night’s events to Qin Xiaoxue.\nWhen he mentioned the ripples in the space, Qin Xiaoxue’s face showed a look of understanding. \"A Secret Realm? I see!\"\nAfter that, Qin Xiaoxue looked at Su Ping with a complex expression. \"Su Ping, do you have any idea what a Secret Realm is worth? And you just told me about it like that?\"\nAs he looked at Qin Xiaoxue at that moment, Su Ping thought to himself, if it hadn’t been for her, I wouldn’t even know the thing was called a Secret Realm, let alone its value. But at a time like this, telling the truth would be just plain stupid, wouldn’t it?\nHe blinked and looked calmly at Qin Xiaoxue. \"I trust you!\"\nSincerity is the ultimate move.\nQin Xiaoxue was taken aback. Then, as Su Ping watched, she blushed for the first time in her life and, without thinking, quickly turned away and spoke at a rapid pace, \"A Secret Realm is the ownerless Beast Taming Space left behind by a powerful Beast Tamer upon their death. There’s no corresponding course in the basic taming academy; only Advanced Colleges teach about it. Secret Realms are incredibly rare, precious, and dangerous. Some may contain the heritage of the Beast Tamers who left them, or even descendants of their Pet Beasts, along with various resources—all can be found within a Secret Realm. In the Dragon Nation, there’s a special organization called the Qintian Monitor; their duty is to detect the emergence of Secret Realms throughout the nation to prevent powerful Pet Beasts from emerging and harming other Beast Tamers. However, if a Secret Realm appears on private property, then the owner of the land has the right to deal with it. They can choose to explore it themselves, hand it over to the Qintian Monitor, or even sell it to others.\"\nAfter finishing in a rush, Qin Xiaoxue took a deep breath and then continued, \"Su Ping, I can’t give you any advice about your Secret Realm, but rest assured, if you don’t want to sell it, no one can force you!\"\nHaving said that, Qin Xiaoxue, as if possessed, suddenly stood up, grabbed Woodhead, who let out a pitiful cry, and ran quickly toward the door.\nHer hasty departure left Su Ping unable to react. Just when he thought Qin Xiaoxue had left for some unknown reason, she suddenly returned, holding the nearly breathless Woodhead, whose eyes were rolling back. With her cheeks still flushed, she stood at the door of the reception room, looking at a baffled Su Ping.\n\"Su Ping, work hard for the professional Beast Tamer assessment in a year’s time! It’s important! So right now, you need to focus on improving your strength! I’ll be waiting for you to participate!\"\n\"?\"\nSu Ping was even more confused. He then saw Qin Xiaoxue truly disappear without a trace this time.\nHe pondered for a while.\nWhat on earth was that woman talking about at the end? How do these things even connect? And waiting for *me* to take the professional Beast Tamer assessment? She’s already been admitted to Magic Capital’s Advanced Beast Taming College, so why would she wait for *me* to take an assessment? Don’t tell me she hasn’t taken it yet? Not likely, right? Besides, even if she hadn’t, *I’ll* be taking *my* assessment here in Jianghai Province, while she should be in Magic Capital. We’re worlds apart! What’s there to wait for?\nᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ\nSu Ping looked suspicious and utterly confused.\nIndeed, Miss Qin’s thinking can be a bit muddled at times.\nHowever, just then, Su Ping suddenly started. He leaped up from the sofa and, in a few quick strides, rushed to the front door of his Heart of Wood Cultivation Base, shouting, \"You haven’t paid yet!\"\nHowever, Qin Xiaoxue was nowhere to be seen in front of the door.\nAt that moment, Su Ping was once again plunged into self-doubt.\nWas Miss Qin just toying with me? That escape act, running off without paying—that doesn’t seem like someone with a muddled mind! Could it be that I was too naïve?\nShaking his head, Su Ping decided not to dwell on it. The help Qin Xiaoxue had given him was far more valuable than a mere million or two.\nRight now, the most important thing was undoubtedly his spoils.\nSu Ping took out the USB drive, excitement shining in his eyes.",

      "content": "Chapter 56: Chapter 56: Universal Cultivation Method, The Birth of Wanmu Wolf! (Third Release)\nExcitedly, he inserted the USB drive into the computer.\nSu Ping was practically rubbing his hands together in anticipation.\nThis posture reminded him of his previous life when he first encountered something on the computer that opened the doors to a new world.\nAt the same time, while looking at the computer, he also paid attention to any activity in the Myriad Spirits Catalog in his mind.\nFinally, the first folder on the USB drive opened, and a document appeared before Su Ping’s eyes:\n[Accelerated Casting is an extremely practical passive Pet Beast Skill, speeding up a Pet Beast’s casting time and skill release speed. In battle, a second’s difference can decide life or death, and Accelerated Casting can make skill use smoother and more fluent...]\nUpon opening the document, the introduction that appeared first went on and on about the effects and abilities of the Accelerated Casting Skill.\nHowever, Su Ping wasn’t the slightest bit impatient, reading each word carefully—this was, after all, Sun Chaoju’s cultivation labor of love.\nBeyond the method for cultivating Accelerated Casting, it also contained his cultivation insights and his years of understanding in nurturing the Forest Wolf.\nIt goes without saying that such knowledge was like a treasure to a Beast Tamer who had just stepped through this door.\nSu Ping was so engrossed that he almost lost track of time.\nIt was only after he finished reading everything that a new prompt appeared in the Forest Wolf log within the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas in his mind, and Su Ping snapped back to reality.\n[Detected Catalog ’Forest Wolf’ special cultivation method: Accelerated Casting Secret Cultivation Technique.]\n[Detected ’Accelerated Spellcasting’ Secret Cultivation Technique has certain flaws and biases. Do you wish to spend 500 Catalog Experience Points to fully perfect it into a universal Pet Beast cultivation method?]\nHuh?\nWhat?\nSu Ping felt the feedback from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas in his mind, and his first thought was simply:\nWhat?\nAt first, he was puzzled. The Skill effect of Heart of Woods seemed far more precious than that of Accelerated Casting. Moreover, Heart of Woods was a Magic Potion formula. Compared to the now fairly complete cultivation method for Accelerated Casting, why would perfecting it cost more Experience Points than perfecting Heart of Woods?\nThis clearly didn’t make sense!\nBut after carefully sensing all the feedback from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, Su Ping finally understood.\nIt wasn’t that it didn’t make sense, but that he hadn’t believed in the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas’s wondrous abilities!\nNow, Su Ping believed!\nBecause according to the feedback from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, the effects and abilities of this Accelerated Casting could be perfected into a universal cultivation method!\nWhat did that mean?\nBefore this, Sun Chaoju’s Secret Cultivation Technique for Accelerated Casting could only be used on the Forest Wolf, allowing only the Forest Wolf to achieve comprehension.\nBut now, after his own perfection, it was no longer limited by Race! Instead, it could be used by all Pet Beasts!\nSuch a leap in advancement, Su Ping believed, not even Vice President Liu could have conceived of, let alone achieved.\nYet with the feedback from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, Su Ping could achieve it with just a thought.\nRestrain himself!\nHe absolutely had to restrain himself!\nSu Ping took a long, deep breath. The big gift package from Sun Chaoju contained another trump card, and Su Ping suspected that this one was likely the big pit that would require Experience Points to fill!\nAlthough 500 Experience Points weren’t much for Su Ping at this stage, he still needed to finish reviewing the other document before he could feel at ease.\nStill wanting to explore it further, Su Ping closed the document and opened another.\nTo his surprise, this document was ten times larger than the other one!\nOne could easily imagine the extent these experimental data and the Wanmu Wolf’s evolution had reached.\nIndeed, that was the case.\nFrom the very first glance, with the accompanying illustrations and explanations, Su Ping became deeply engrossed.\nFrom this research report, Su Ping also learned how Sun Chaoju and the Wolf Den breeding base had discovered the evolution method for the Wanmu Wolf.\nThe Wanmu Wolf was a special evolutionary type of Pet Beast, created by further intensifying the Forest Wolf’s Wood Element Attribute.\nThe focus of enhancement was on that Wood Attribute!\nPreviously at the Wolf Den base, an odd Forest Wolf had emerged. It seemed to have eaten too much meat and one day suddenly started gnawing on a tree stump.\nAt first, the Wolf Den paid little attention.\nBut later, they noticed that after gnawing on those trees, the Forest Wolf, in addition to its normal behavior, started displaying new actions, such as standing perfectly still or burying its paws in the ground.\nIt truly seemed as if it was developing into a plant.\nThis situation was very strange. Initially, they thought it might be some kind of illness. However, the Wolf Den was a substantial operation; after tests revealed nothing abnormal, they didn’t pay much mind to a single Forest Wolf.\nUntil one day, after basking in the sunlight for several days without moving, eating, or drinking, the Forest Wolf comprehended a Special Skill, one that a Forest Wolf would absolutely never comprehend:\nPhotosynthesis.\nThis Special Skill, which Su Ping had seen before on a Luozisong (Pine)’s offspring, was a Special Skill unique to all Plant Type Pet Beasts.\nThis Skill had some similarities to Sunlight Absorption, but its effect was entirely different.\nIn other words, at this point, the Forest Wolf, under these strange circumstances, having ingested a large amount of plant matter and mimicking plant growth, had begun to take on plant characteristics.\nSu Ping pondered this, then continued reading the research report.\nThe changes in this peculiar Forest Wolf quickly attracted Sun Chaoju’s attention.\nAfterward, several more days passed as the Forest Wolf fully simulated becoming a plant. During these days, Sun Chaoju was far from idle.\nAnomalies in Pet Beasts often represented huge opportunities and new research directions!\nAnd indeed, this proved true. During those few days, Sun Chaoju adopted methods used for nurturing Plant Type Pet Beasts, purchasing considerable Water and Earth Element resources to use on the Forest Wolf, which was now in a plant-like state.\nAnd, not unexpectedly, after the Forest Wolf consumed a massive amount of these resources, its Energy accumulation reached a peak, and evolution began!\nHowever, as Sun Chaoju waited with eager anticipation, the final result was, predictably, tragic.\nThree days. Three days later, the evolving Wanmu Wolf completely lost all remaining traces of its animal form. Its organs, viscera, and flesh all underwent plant fiberization.\nUltimately, even the plant-like husk did not remain; it completely rotted away and vanished from the world.\nAfter that, Sun Chaoju and the Wolf Den began secretly researching this subject, pouring vast amounts of effort and resources into their attempts.Thɪs\nThe results, in the end, were all the same, without exception.\nAll ended in failure!\nAnd as Su Ping finished reading all the research logs, just as he had expected, the Catalog for the Forest Wolf within the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas in his mind slowly lit up once more.",

(Four Updates)\n[Discovery of a special evolution path within the \"Forest Wolf\" Catalog: Wanmu Wolf.]\n[The evolution path to \"Wanmu Wolf\" is in a fragmented state. Do you want to spend 1,682 Catalog Experience Points to complete this evolution path?]\nIt really is possible!\nHe lay on the couch in front of the computer.\nSu Ping’s consciousness fully merged with the Forest Wolf Catalog before his eyes.\nEverything else aside, the most important thing was the line of numbers beneath the Catalog entry:\n[Catalog: Forest Wolf]\n[A special Wolf Tribe adept at using Wood Attribute, possessing extremely strong Life Force. Adult Forest Wolves are typically Elite Level, skilled in Skills such as Sunlight Absorption, Vine Strangling, Self-Healing, and Accelerated Growth.]\n[Current Catalog Level: 2 (813/2000)]\nSu Ping had accumulated these over eight hundred Experience Points bit by bit over the past few days.\nIn addition to the daily interactions with fewer than thirty Forest Wolves, which yielded dozens of Experience Points each day, the initial sheltering, Cultivation, and breakthroughs also granted some Experience Points. The amounts varied, but over the days, he had accumulated quite a bit.\nFurthermore, discovering the effects of Wolf Tobacco on Forest Wolves had yielded an additional hundred Experience Points.\nAll in all, there were quite a few channels for gaining Experience Points.\nHowever, he was still far short of the Experience Points required to complete the Wanmu Wolf evolution path; the total needed was nearly double what he currently possessed.\nThe roughly 1,682 Experience Points required might not seem like much on its own. However, compared to the whopping fifty thousand Experience Points needed to investigate the cause of Xiao Qing’s bloodline Mutation, it was merely a drop in the bucket.ᴛhis ᴜpdated by NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nSu Ping let out a long breath.\nThe allure of a new evolution method was simply too great.\nFirstly, if this evolution method was accessible and its Cultivation cost wasn’t too high, it could be presented at the annual Breeder Competition. An evolution method like this would undoubtedly win unimaginable rewards at the Competition, and might even take first place barring any surprises.\nWhat did common Pet Beasts plus low-cost Cultivation and evolution represent? It represented an enhancement of the nation’s overall strength! This could even be considered a major event capable of boosting the nation’s destiny.\nConversely, if the evolution method required costly resources for Cultivation, it would likely mean the evolved Race possessed substantial Racial Potential, making it a powerful Evolutionary Body! In that case, he could keep the evolution path for himself, not even entering the Competition. It could serve as the foundation for his own Cultivation base, or even as an important legacy for the Su Family’s future. It could even be used to name the family in the future—for instance, the Wanmu Wolf Su Family, or something similar.\nThis was the very foundation for establishing oneself. Such was the value of a Pet Beast evolution path.\nAnd now, Su Ping didn’t need to do anything else. He just needed to spend a few more days at his Pet Beast base, cultivating more Forest Wolves. Then, he could completely master this evolution path known as the Wanmu Wolf.\nA period of ten-odd days was neither particularly long nor short. For many Breeders engrossed in tedious Cultivation experiments, such a period might pass in the blink of an eye.\nBut what was the greatest torment in the world? For gamers, it was knowing that GTA6 and Black Myth: Wukong would be released in ten days. For prisoners, it was knowing their sentence would end in ten days. And at this very moment, for a Breeder like Su Ping, the agony he faced was no less than such tortures—perhaps even worse! What could be more agonizing for a Breeder than a new evolution path that required a wait of about ten days before it could be unveiled?\nIf he had known ten days earlier, couldn’t he have started targeted Cultivation and preparations sooner? If he had known ten days earlier, wouldn’t his strength have improved much more rapidly? If he had known ten days earlier and could have cultivated the Wanmu Wolf sooner, wouldn’t the Forest Wolf Catalog’s Level have increased much faster?\nSu Ping racked his brains, searching for justifications.\nQin Xiaoxue had urged him to rapidly increase his strength within this year or so, to pass the Beast Tamer assessment next year and become an official Combat Beast Tamer.\nAnd there was one more reason of utmost importance to Su Ping! Old Sha!\nOld Sha was already very old. Pet Beasts, unlike humans, were not relatively long-lived species. Pet Beasts also had lifespans. And Pet Beasts from Races with low Racial Potential and low personal Levels had correspondingly shorter lifespans. Ordinary Forest Wolves at Old Sha’s age wouldn’t just be experiencing a decline in vitality; most would have already reached the end of their lifespans. It was only because Old Sha had broken through his race limit and reached the Commander Level. Otherwise, his situation would be uncertain now. But this still wasn’t enough. Old Sha was his family, the Su Family’s best companion. Su Ping couldn’t just watch Old Sha’s vitality wane and let him die of old age! Therefore, for Old Sha’s sake, Su Ping had to unlock the Wanmu Wolf’s evolution method as soon as possible and make Old Sha the very first Wanmu Wolf! To ensure Old Sha could continue living, above all else, Su Ping would not allow Old Sha to die and leave him and his father before Old Sha could witness him becoming the most remarkable Beast Tamer and Breeder.\nSo, from this moment on, unlocking the Wanmu Wolf’s evolution path was the absolute top priority. Even leveling up the Forest Wolf Catalog was less important!\nThinking this, Su Ping stood up.\nHow could he quickly gain Catalog Experience? The answer was simple: cultivate more Pet Beasts and expand his Forest Wolf Troop. That would do it.\nOriginally, Su Ping had considered buying some other Pet Beasts and, in his spare time, unlocking them in the Catalog to see if he could obtain other kinds of wondrous Talents.\nHe would definitely buy other Pet Beasts in the future, especially Plant Type Pet Beasts. As his father had said, with the Forest Wolves, they could form a perfect symbiotic relationship within the ecosystem. But that certainly wasn’t urgent right now. All his energy now had to be focused on acquiring more Forest Wolves, raising their intimacy to the required level to gain Experience Points, and then beginning their Cultivation. He aimed to gather the more than 1,600 Catalog Experience Points needed for the Forest Wolf Catalog in just a few days!\nSu Ping had saved up several million over this period and had been wondering if he could get some experimental equipment. But now, that was no longer urgent. Expanding the Forest Wolf Troop and gaining Experience for the Forest Wolf Catalog had become the paramount concerns.\nIf he unlocked the Wanmu Wolf evolution, he could help other Forest Wolves evolve in the future. How many times more valuable would that be compared to the profits from cultivating the Heart of Woods?\nYou have to give some to get some! Besides, acquiring Forest Wolves wasn’t a one-time expense. Continuous Cultivation was a necessary process, both now and for the future.\nThis is what I have to do,\nSu Ping resolved. At the same time, he took out his phone and started expanding the scale of his Forest Wolf Troop.",

They were also the busiest. However, this busyness was different from serving customers; Su Ping not only willingly embraced it, but he also enjoyed it.\nFirstly, regarding savings and deposits, Su Ping had set aside one million for daily expenses and emergencies. The rest was all used to purchase Forest Wolf cubs.\nNow, the previously 26-member Forest Wolf pack had finally been expanded!\nSu Ping rounded up the number. Not counting his own Xiao Qing, the Wolf Pack now numbered 50!\nIn other words, he had bought a total of 25 Forest Wolf cubs this time!\nThis move could also be considered a major one.\nHe made a direct phone purchase from the Breeder Association, each cub costing about 300,000 to 500,000. The price wasn’t expensive; it was equivalent to buying at cost.\nHowever, for Su Ping, these little fellows were worth far more than their price tag. They also represented his future foundation and companions. At the same time, they were new family members for Heart of Woods.\nAfter all, Su Ping had given up on the business of directly reselling Forest Wolves; the profit was low, and he couldn’t bear to sell the Forest Wolves he raised himself.\nOf course, more importantly, there were the Experience Points provided by these little fellows. With twice as many wolf cubs, just satisfying their intimacy requirement once would yield about 10 Experience Points each; for 25 cubs, that would be more than 300 Experience Points.\nAdding in the Experience Points gained from their Cultivation, growth, and daily interactions, the Evolution of Wanmu Wolf was progressing. Su Ping estimated that in about two more days, he could complete it!\nThinking of all this, Su Ping didn’t even feel sleepy. As he watched the little wolves that had come into the jungle and were already learning to play with the larger Forest Wolves, he wished each one of them would grow up quickly.\nHowever, rubbing his temples, Su Ping felt that he really needed to hire some people. Looking after and training Pet Beasts was something Su Ping couldn’t entrust to others. But day by day, there were still various miscellaneous tasks that he needed to handle. However, he didn’t feel quite at ease with those he might hire. Someone like Li Shu, whom he knew well and could trust, was better; for the rest, Su Ping had no trust.\nAt this thought, Su Ping began to miss Qin Xiaoxue. Miss Qin had been of great help to him these past few days. Apart from Qin Xiaoxue, the only other person he could trust was his own father.\nThe more he tried not to think about it, the angrier he became. He picked up his cell phone and made a call to Su Anyong.\nIndeed, while previously he could still get through, now the voice prompt on the call had changed to \"The subscriber you dialed has turned off their phone,\" leaving Su Ping with no way to vent his frustration.\nHowever, just as he was thinking, his phone really did DING with a new message. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a message from Su Anyong, but from the other person Su Ping was thinking about.\n[Qin Xiaoxue] I’ve arrived at Magic Capital and just remembered I forgot to pay you the Cultivation fee. But I’m not going to pay it now. I’ll mail you something from Magic Capital. Remember, from now on, I’m a permanent VIP at your place! All future Cultivations are on the house for me!\nHmm?\nIt’s rare for Miss Qin to remember skipping out on the bill,\nbut Su Ping didn’t really plan on asking Qin Xiaoxue for the money.\nObviously, it’s not in her nature to skip out on a bill.\nHowever, instead of transferring the money, Qin Xiaoxue mailed something? What kind of item could it be, for her to be so bold? Permanent VIP? All future Cultivations free of charge?\nSu Ping certainly believed that Qin Xiaoxue wasn’t one to make empty boasts. Since she said so, she must have the confidence and backing for it. And thinking about this wealthy lady’s usual way of doing things, Su Ping couldn’t help but feel eager.\nCould it be that Natural Essence she mentioned before? But that’s unlikely. Emperor Level materials and treasures... even with Qin Xiaoxue’s prominent status, such things probably couldn’t be mobilized so easily.\nSu Ping didn’t inquire further, simply replying in the message:\n[Su Ping] No problem!\nThinking here, Su Ping once again recalled Qin Xiaoxue’s previous mention of that matter concerning the Evolution of the Crown Wolf Emperor.\nThe future Evolution of Woodhead... is it Emperor Level? Emperor Level... ah. That’s someone truly standing at the pinnacle of the Dragon Nation’s hierarchy. Such a Beast Tamer could already be addressed with a title of respect. If Qin Xiaoxue’s future really leads to her successfully attaining a King Level title, which Pet Beast would she be titled with? Wolf King? It seems unlikely, as there are too many powerful Beast Tamers with Wolf Tribe Pet Beasts. The title ’Wolf King’... only someone who ranks among the very best even among Emperor-level Beastmasters specializing in wolf-type Pet Beasts would be qualified to be called that, right? Regardless, such an individual would be considered top-tier in the entire Jianghai Province. After all, an Emperor Level individual could add ’Sky King’ after their surname. There are probably only a few in the entire Jianghai Province.\nRecalling her words again, a bright light flashed in Su Ping’s eyes as he murmured, \"Wolf King? The Beast Tamer examination? Suddenly, I’m feeling a rush of excitement!\"\nSu Ping, possessing the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, felt a confidence second to none.The source of this content ɪs ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nIn that moment, as Su Ping looked up at the sky, the light in his eyes shone brighter than the stars.\nIt’s a shame that such a rare surge of emotion was interrupted by a Wolf Howl!\nOld Sha, seeing his young master had yet to make a move, began to urge him on:\n\"AWOO! (Hurry... this time... catch it!)\"\nDetermination filled Old Sha’s eyes.\nSu Ping came back to his senses. That’s right, even with the chaos of the past two days, Su Ping almost always engaged in a fixed activity every night!\nThat was to cross the forest, coming to his backyard, by the bank of the Lingxi River. To this creepy riverbank that appeared by night.\nWaiting for the arrival of that little Paperman.\nAnd indeed, over these past few days, the little Paperman had shown up every day without fail. After appearing, it wouldn’t waste words, directly engaging Old Sha, only to be instantly defeated and then vanish.\nIf not for Su Ping’s order not to harm it and to try to capture it alive, preferably captured alive, Old Sha would have bitten it to death long ago.\nWhen had it ever felt so aggrieved and frustrated by a mere Ordinary Level little Paperman?\nLooking at the irritated Old Sha, Su Ping also felt that, based on his understanding of this little Paperman over the past few days, he should try a different approach!\nAt the very least, I should first see what the deal is with this little Paperman!\nAll those days of encounters, though frequent, lasted only a few seconds each before it disappeared, not even giving Su Ping a chance to activate the Eye of Truth.",

      "content": "Chapter 59: Chapter 59: The True Swordsman? (Second Update)\nThe night wind was cool and pleasant, blowing away much of the day’s heat.\nThe sound of the rippling Lingxi River was in the distance.\nSu Ping and Old Sha did not have to wait too long. Sure enough, it wasn’t long before another spatial ripple slowly appeared.\nThat small figure of the Paperman appeared before their eyes once more.\nThe Paperman was almost instantaneously in action, drawing the paper sword in its hand as it appeared.\nWith a flash of the blade, the Wolf Tobacco in front was cleanly split apart.\nBut this time, the Paperman’s movements hesitated slightly.\nThis was because the figure it had been battling just a few days ago was now standing far away, showing no apparent intention of engaging with it.\nThe paper sword returned to its sheath, and the Paperman yelled out to the distant figure, \"WAH! (To fight... to strike, a true... Swordsman will never give up on defeating an opponent!)\"\nLooking at this earnest little fellow in front of him, Su Ping was slightly taken aback. He had never encountered such a Paperman before.\nA Swordsman? In the Beastmaster Society, this term is both familiar and strange, isn’t it? Why would a Paperman consider itself a Swordsman?\nSu Ping did not understand, but he seemed to have found some key points.\nDoes this little guy keep jumping out from that so-called Secret Realm just to beat Old Sha? The persistence of a so-called Swordsman? That’s too ridiculous. I’d probably be waiting until the cows come home for an Ordinary Level Paperman to defeat Old Sha. However, without a doubt, this Paperman must hold the secrets of the Secret Realm!\nAnd now, having realized the value of the Secret Realm, Su Ping could not simply ignore it.\nThere could indeed be other Pet Beasts within the Secret Realm, but only this little creature seems to be able to move in and out freely. That’s enough for me to study carefully. Obviously, the current situation is how to lower the high-spirited combativeness of this little Paperman before me, get it to calm down completely, and get along well with me, so that I can study the secrets it carries.\nAnd it must be said, Su Ping was also moved after seeing this peculiar little Paperman!\nAlthough the evolution of a mutated Pet Beast is more difficult compared to the evolution and training of regular Pet Beasts, its potential is also much higher. I truly don’t believe that I won’t be able to figure out the evolution of my own Pet Beasts in the future.\nClearly, before this, Su Ping had also collected some knowledge about the Paperman species of Pet Beasts, but it didn’t seem to apply much to this particular Paperman Swordsman before him.\nHowever, the effect of Telepathic Communication came into play at this moment.\nLooking at the Paperman full of fighting spirit, he spoke using the power of Telepathic Communication, \"Is someone like you already a true Swordsman?\"\nPet Beast training and companionship, quite clearly, also emphasized adaptability.\nFrom a single phrase spoken by the Paperman, Su Ping had found an entry point.\nAnd the first rule of the Breeder’s code is to make your Pet Beast respect and admire you as a Breeder.\nIn fact, as if on cue, the Paperman paused slightly, \"WAH?\"\nSu Ping clearly understood this phrase, even without Telepathic Communication.The source of thɪs content is NovᴇlFirenᴇt\nHe put on an inscrutable look and continued, \"\nA true Swordsman is solitary, carefree, and so lofty it’s chilling. The most important condition to achieve this is sheer strength! You are still far from it!\n\"\n\"WAH?!\"\nThe little Paperman looked at Su Ping in confusion, then glanced at the paper longsword in its hand. Afterward, the little Paperman looked at Old Sha, who was eying it tigerishly yet disdainfully, and then at the Forest Wolves, whose auras all seemed stronger than its own. It nodded, seemingly in considerable approval.\nThis human in front of me, who can command so many powerful wolves to fight, is indeed a formidable expert,\nit thought.\nHowever, the little Paperman then spoke again, \"WAH? (Solitary, carefree, so lofty it’s chilling... What does that mean?)\"\nWhat does that mean? How would I know? I’m not a Swordsman. Although there are many Swordsmen in martial arts TV dramas, movies, and anime, come to think of it, those words put together only have one meaning: just showing off. Could it be that I need to answer like that? Clearly, that’s not reliable.\nBut Su Ping didn’t need to explain! He simply looked at the little Paperman before him, \"Little guy, want to understand what a true Swordsman is? Then stay with me. I’ll make you into a truly strong Swordsman! You should be able to tell that I am stronger than you, so naturally, I won’t deceive you.\"\nAlthough Su Ping still maintained a calm appearance, his heart couldn’t help but race. If he couldn’t sweet-talk this little Paperman into staying, then the next time this little guy showed up, he would have to find something to restrain the Space Element, seal the space, and then forcibly capture it. However, if it came to that, trying to enact a Soul Contract later and uncover the secrets within this Secret Realm would be much more difficult.\nSu Ping watched the little Paperman nervously.\nThe little Paperman also seemed to sink into thought.\nIts expressions are so easy to read.\nAt this moment, on the little Paperman’s cheeks, the features drawn with an oil-based pen also seemed to reflect deep thought.\nAre its facial expressions this two-dimensional and abstract? Especially that big, bold question mark beside its forehead.\nSu Ping blinked, and then the next second, he saw that the big ’?’ on the Paperman’s head abruptly turned into a red ’!’.\nBefore Su Ping could thoroughly appreciate this comic-style facial transformation of the Paperman, the next moment, the ripples of space appeared again.\nThe little Paperman’s figure had already vanished without a trace.\nLooking at the spot where nothing remained except his own wolf pack, Su Ping frowned and sighed somewhat helplessly.\nAs expected. Although this little Paperman looked somewhat dazed, it wasn’t so easily fooled. It seems I’ll have to resort to extraordinary measures next time.\nHowever, just as this thought had arisen in Su Ping’s mind and he was somewhat dispirited about leaving, the space ripples that had vanished a moment ago reappeared.\nThe next second, the little Paperman that had left and returned reappeared in front of him. But this time, the little Paperman was no longer in the previous ready-to-draw-sword stance. Instead, it was carrying a paper package, which looked very much like a large wad of waste paper rolled into a ball.\nThe little Paperman put down the package and, under Old Sha’s watchful gaze, approached Su Ping. It even performed an ancient human-style bow, \"WAH! (I want... to become a true... Swordsman!)\"\nLooking at the little Paperman in front of him, Su Ping revealed a smile. At last, he could finally use the Eye of Truth on this strange Paperman that seemed to be ’requesting apprenticeship’.",

      "content": "Chapter 60: Chapter 60: Perfection Level Jinge Technique, The Swordsman’s Panache! (Three more)\nClearly, the Paperman was extremely sensitive to being perceived by spiritual power. Otherwise, it would not have lashed out the first time it sensed Su Ping’s attention. Pet Beasts that grew up in the wild or within a Secret Realm were the same; after all, one small oversight in the wild could lead to death. Being as cautious as possible wasn’t an exaggeration.\nHowever, it also sensed that its human master, Su, indeed seemed to have no ill intentions. After a slight, slightly uncomfortable shake of its body, the Paperman made no other movements.\nAt this moment, Su Ping’s sight was greeted with the detailed attribute abilities of this little Paperman:\n[Mutated Paperman (Wild)]\n[Attributes: Gold, Undead]\n[Current Level: Ordinary Eighth Rank]\n[Racial Potential: Elite First Rank]\n[Skills: Paper Body Folding (Beginner), Jinge Technique (Perfection), Sword Soul Mark (Special)]\nOriginally, Su Ping was slightly taken aback when he saw the little Paperman’s level. Given its terrifying attack power, he had thought the Paperman’s Realm must have reached the race’s theorized maximum potential: Common Tenth Level.\nYet, Su Ping had not expected that this little Paperman was only at Ordinary Eighth Rank. Moreover, it had even broken through its race limit!\nUpon seeing the last skill, Su Ping understood. Then he became even more dumbfounded and astonished.\nI won’t comment on that Sword Soul Mark,\nhe thought,\nas it’s beyond my cognition.\nBut what is this Jinge Technique? A Perfection Level Jinge Technique?\nKeep in mind that even Old Sha, who had broken through his race limit, only had one skill, Sunlight Absorption, at this level. After all, Old Sha had lived for over forty years and been through numerous battles, both large and small. Yet, he still only had one skill that reached Perfection. One can imagine just how difficult it is to upgrade a skill to the Perfection Level.\nBut how could a mere little Paperman possess a Perfection Level skill? And what’s more, it’s the freaking Jinge Technique? Is this skill even compatible with a Paperman?\nAs Su Ping pondered, the Eye of Truth presented the skill before him:\n[Jinge Technique (Perfection): Allows the user to make any touched object extremely sharp while also igniting the Qi of Jinge, significantly enhancing sharpness! Highly powerful!]\nIndeed, this was why the little Paperman had such formidable and terrifying attacking power.\nSu Ping pondered for a moment, then with a mental command, he examined the Paperman’s other skill. Sure enough:\n[Sword Soul Mark (Special): A special skill that cannot be upgraded, with unknown effects.]ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nSu Ping figured it was probably this skill that enabled the little Paperman to freely enter and exit that so-called Secret Realm.\nFrom this, it’s clear that I really can’t just wash my hands of the matter,\nhe mused.\nThe little Paperman could probably leave whenever it wants to. What method can I use to thoroughly fool it?\nOn the way back, Su Ping continued pondering this question.\nThen, he led Old Sha and Xiao Qing, along with the little Paperman that had been following them looking somewhat dazed, into the side chamber. He turned on the large light in the sitting room of the side chamber.\nAnd unexpectedly, under the light, the little Paperman, without the eerie feel of the night, had a kind of indescribably naive charm with its tiny paper body. Though it was peculiar to describe an Undead Pet Beast as ’naively charming,’ it truly felt apt at this moment.\n\"Little fellow, first get familiar with the environment here. From now on, this will be your dwelling. Of course, you can also return to your original place. However, if you want to become a true swordsman, you must wait for me here every evening at this time. Got it?\"\n\"WOOOA! (Yes!)\"\nLooking at the Paperman’s serious demeanor, Su Ping nodded contentedly. However, once he stepped out of the room, he felt a bit helpless.\nHow should I train it after this? Could it truly be with the nonsensical swordsmanship found in TV dramas?\nClearly, Su Ping believed that there must be skills similar to swordsmanship in this world, but learning from TV shows definitely wouldn’t be reliable. And the significance and importance of this Paperman were beyond imagination. From Qin Xiaoxue’s words, he knew the value of a Secret Realm. If he wanted to firmly grasp that yet-to-appear Secret Realm through the Paperman, he had to convince it completely!\nApart from some deceptive training methods, Su Ping sighed.\nThere’s only one option left,\nhe thought.\nAccelerated Casting!\nAccelerated Casting was Sun Chaoju’s exclusive Forest Wolf training method. However, with the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, Su Ping could definitely adapt it into a universal ability for all Pet Beasts. The Paperman was obviously no exception.\nPreviously, Su Ping hadn’t scheduled the perfection of Accelerated Casting. This was simply because he wasn’t eager to use this training method on his own Forest Wolves yet; their current training progress was sufficient. Of course, the most important factor was the shortage of Experience Points. While the evolution method for the Wanmu Wolf was nearing completion, Su Ping was also contemplating upgrading his Forest Wolves to Level 3 in addition to focusing on the Wanmu Wolf.\nAccelerated Casting required a total of five hundred Experience Points—a significant amount. Clearly, the Paperman’s appearance had caused some changes to Su Ping’s plans.\nHowever, there was no need to worry in the short term. The evolution and perfection of the Wanmu Wolf remained the top priority. After all, even if he were to teach the Paperman the Accelerated Casting skill, it wouldn’t happen overnight. If the Paperman didn’t appreciate it and its intimacy level wasn’t high enough, it wouldn’t be able to illuminate its page in the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas. Worse, it might even run away. That would mean Su Ping’s exploration of the Secret Realm would fail, resulting in a huge loss.\nTraining and taming a Pet Beast is like courting a girl,\nSu Ping mused.\nIt isn’t about constant appeasement; one also has to learn the art of creating some distance, a bit of push and pull. My Experience Points should first be used to complete the evolution method for the Wanmu Wolf.\nWith that in mind, Su Ping went through his routine, checking the training and combat of his Forest Wolves. No matter what, the Forest Wolves were his foundation, and their combat power was most crucial. Through linked and shared training, constant practice and battles were the quickest way to improve skill levels. And raising skill levels was the fastest way to enhance strength.\nSu Ping saw Xiao Qing also go off to train with the wolf pack. Only Old Sha remained close by, clearly worried the Paperman might harbor some cunning scheme and thus stayed to protect his young master.\nSu Ping smiled and patted Old Sha’s large head, telling him to stay put. He then returned to his room, turned on his computer, and started searching for:\n’Sword Artifact Pet Beast’\n’gold-based skills’\n’Weakest Undead Pet Beast: Paperman Analysis’\nAnd finally, he began to watch some martial arts TV dramas he had never seen before. He needed to see what the elegance of swordsmen was like. Or to put it more directly, he wanted to see how swordsmen \"showed off.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 61: Chapter 61: Invincibility is Truly Lonely... (Fourth Update)\nIs this really the work of human hands?\nSu Ping was puzzled.\nHe was looking at the latest TV series on his computer, a martial arts drama titled: \"My Sword Spirit Pet Beast Girlfriend.\"\nIt certainly had a similar flavor to what he remembered from his previous life,\nhe thought.\nIt seemed that no matter the genre, romance was a mandatory element. However, in this world, there was an additional rule: every show, regardless of type, had to feature Pet Beasts.\nOf course, since Blue Star was a world of Beast Tamers, this was somewhat justifiable. But...\nSu Ping looked at the pretty-boy lead on the computer screen.\nHe isn’t even as handsome as I am,\nSu Ping thought,\nyet he still garners a barrage of ’AHHH!’ screams in the bullet comments.\nThe actor was holding a Sword Device, a blatant product placement with \"Ouyezi Corporation\" displayed in enlarged font. The female Sword Spirit materializing from the Sword Device made him feel completely numb.\nArtefact Spirit Pet Beasts did exist, but they were known to be as difficult to train as Mechanical Type Pet Beasts. The Beast Master Association even had two corresponding subsidiary branches: the Artifact Refiners Association and the Mechanics Association. Compared to Elemental, Plant, Animal, and Undead Type Pet Beasts, these two types were much rarer.\nBut could Pet Beast Devices capable of producing Artefact Spirits really be made by your damn metal resource manufacturing company? If they had that capability, the chairman of the Artifact Refiners Association in the Imperial Capital would surely be their company’s chairman. Su Ping simply didn’t believe it.\nIndeed, he had no reason to expect anything from these cringeworthy modern TV dramas. However, at least a few highly-rated films had decent performances. But as for any deeper interpretation of Beast Taming Swordsmanship or related Skills, there truly was none. The general content was similar to the Swordsman movies and novels of his previous life, just with some Pet Beast elements added.\nGoogle seaʀᴄh\nThe swords wielded by protagonists were often extremely high-quality Artefact Spirits. These types of movies were typically sponsored and produced by the Artifact Refiners Association. Compared to other Beast Tamers, those specializing in Mechanical Types were indeed rare. If not for their efforts to maintain a presence in the entertainment industry, they might easily be forgotten. And the concepts of knights-errant and the martial world, long-standing in the Dragon Nation, were undoubtedly the best vehicles for this.\nShaking his head, Su Ping mentally reviewed some lines and dialogue from the movies, along with information about the Paperman’s habits shared by Undead Type Breeders on a private online forum exclusive to Breeders. Only then did he begin his meditation.\nI need to work harder and faster. I can cut down on sleep a bit, but my Realm must improve rapidly. Setting aside the agreement about Qin Xiaoxue’s professional Beast Tamer assessment, I have to strive hard just to break through to the Elite Level quickly. Then I can figure out how to contract this little Paperman without any lingering concerns.\n「The night passed swiftly.」\nThe next day followed a similar routine. After finishing the daily training with the Forest Wolf and his own meditation, Su Ping went to the side room.\nAlmost the moment he opened the door, spatial ripples appeared, and the Paperman reappeared before him. \"WOAH!\"\nIt was a simple greeting, nothing more. But Su Ping smiled, took out a stack of something, and handed it to the Paperman.\nIt was a stack of stiff paper cards Su Ping had prepared some time ago when he first started scheming to get this little Paperman. Papermen needed to eat too, and their food was precisely this kind of paper.\nSu Ping’s stack of stiff paper cards was clearly top-grade. Made from low-grade ironwood, the taste was absolutely superb!\nAnd it truly was.\nThe Paperman immediately tore off a piece and tossed it into its mouth. \"WOAH! (Delicious!)\"\nAt the same time, its face switched to a cheerful expression, complete with rosy cheeks.\nTruth be told, with those rosy cheeks, it was quite an adorable sight. Obviously, this little fellow wasn’t that easy to fool.\nAfter munching away, it looked up at Su Ping expectantly.\nSu Ping, meanwhile, began to deliver the speech he had prepared, summarizing what he had watched the previous night and the points he had thought out during the day. \"For a Swordsman, the most important thing is to start with the fundamentals. And for a Swordsman, the most crucial fundamental is undoubtedly Swordsmanship! So, what is Swordsmanship?!\"\n\"WOAH?! (What is that?!)\"\nA jet-black question mark clearly appeared above the round eyes of the little Paperman, who was only as tall as Su Ping’s calf.\nSu Ping then chuckled. \"There are many techniques in Swordsmanship, but the most important are the slash and the stab! These are the two most critical basic skills of swordplay. Right now, you need to practice these two moves! Once you’ve mastered them, we’ll move on to other basic exercises.\"\n\"WOAH?\"\nSeeing the question mark on the little Paperman’s head not only remain but also multiply, Su Ping wasn’t worried. He took out a practice sword he had also prepared earlier.\nHe led the little Paperman to the garden outside.\nIt had to be said, Su Ping, having practiced a bit himself, demonstrated with some proficiency. \"This is a stab. This is a slash. This slash, when drawn directly from the sheath, is particularly effective. We can call it... the Sheath-Drawing... Sword Slash!\"\nThe little Paperman quickly began to practice.\nHowever, it was quite obvious the little Paperman had a real aptitude for this. Or perhaps its experiences in combat within that Secret Realm, or some other reason, meant it had already mastered such Swordsmanship to perfection long ago.\nWatching the little Paperman’s precise and textbook-perfect swings, which were several times faster than his own, Su Ping nodded in satisfaction. \"Very good!\"\n\"Don’t think this is too simple. Let me tell you, all the Sword Technique Skills used by famous Swordsmen begin with practicing these most basic movements! Only by thoroughly mastering these fundamentals can you learn more advanced swordplay techniques later. Understand?\"\n\"WOAH!\"\nAfter receiving the little Paperman’s affirmative \"WOAH!\", Su Ping continued, \"Of course. But there’s no need to rush for now. Tonight, and every day hereafter, you can practice slowly. You need to practice these two movements until they are perfect, tens of thousands of times. Got it?\"\n\"WOAH!\"\n\"Good. Now, I’ll show you what a true Swordsman looks like! This will help you correctly understand what it means to be a real Swordsman.\"\nWith that, Su Ping led the eager-looking little Paperman back to the living room of the guest quarters. He inserted the USB drive containing the downloaded movies into the television and set it to play on a loop.\nThe movie slowly began...\nThen, after half an hour, the moment arrived!\nSu Ping and the little Paperman watched as the white-robed protagonist on screen transformed into a streak of light and shadow.\nTime seemed to freeze. The next second, the protagonist re-sheathed his outrageously flashy Spirit Saint Level Sword Device Pet Beast, the ’Snowfall Divine Sword’. Then, the scene on screen expanded, the world instantly turning incredibly bleak as an outpouring of Sword Qi energy, created by exaggerated special effects, was unleashed.\nThe special effects for this sword move were so dramatic they could seemingly split mountains and sunder rivers; heck, they looked powerful enough to rend the heavens and cleave the earth. Ultimately, amidst these over-the-top effects, the colossal beast antagonist—which had made the little Paperman cry out repeatedly—was instantly slain by this single strike.\nThe protagonist, however, didn’t even glance back. He simply adjusted his perfectly undisturbed hair, looked up at the snowflakes gently falling from the sky, and murmured, \"Invincibility... is truly lonely...\"\nThen, he gracefully departed, leaving behind only the great beast’s corpse, the stunned onlookers, and the lingering, exaggerated special effects.\n\"WOAH! WOAH! WOAH!\"\nPointing excitedly at the television, the little Paperman was practically vibrating with excitement. It even hopped onto the coffee table, its hand already gripping the paper sword at its waist, looking as if it might draw and imitate the move at any second.\nSu Ping hastily stopped it.\nEven though I can make money now, I don’t want to spend it on redecorating.\nBut it was clear my bamboozling tactics were both professional and effective. It really got the little Paperman fired up!\nThinking this, Su Ping breathed a sigh of relief. Then, he uttered words he would regret for the rest of his life: \"Alright. To become a Swordsman like that, you need immense strength. Even Swordsmen of that caliber trained one strike at a time. Understand?!\"\n\"WOAH!\"\nInstantly, without even waiting for Su Ping’s command, the little Paperman dashed excitedly into the side room’s garden and began practicing the stabs and slashes over and over again.\nWatching the hardworking little Paperman, Su Ping smiled and nodded. Then he uttered the words he would regret forever: \"Great! From now on, after you train for more than four hours, you can watch recordings of famous Swordsmen for a while to study the way of the Swordsman!\"\nThe little Paperman waved its arms in delight. \"WOAH! (Yay!)\"",

      "content": "Chapter 62: Chapter 62 Xiao Qing’s Growth, Experience Fulfilled! (One More)\nEarly one clear morning, just as he stepped out of the house, he saw Xiao Qing whimpering toward Su Ping with a look of grievance.\nIt was apparent that for the past two days, he had been mostly preoccupied with that little Paperman, neglecting the care of his genuine Contracted Beast.\nAfter patting Xiao Qing on the head, Su Ping finally smiled and said, \"Xiao Qing, have you been training hard these days?\"\n\"AWOO! (Xiao Qing... working hard!)\"\nHaving said that, as if trying earnestly to prove itself, Xiao Qing’s body slowly started to grow larger under Su Ping’s astonished gaze.\nSu Ping was truly taken aback.\nHe looked at Xiao Qing before him with the Eye of Truth. Sure enough, Xiao Qing’s Level was still an Ordinary Seventh Rank, but under the observation of the Eye of Truth, there was now an additional skill in Xiao Qing’s Skills:\n[Accelerated Growth (Beginner): Uses Wood Element power to rapidly increase one’s body size, enhancing corresponding strength.]\nNow, with Accelerated Growth, Xiao Qing had fully mastered all its Racial Skills. At the same time, it had acquired another Heart of the Poison Wood.\nThinking of this, Su Ping became spirited.\nAfter rubbing the slightly aggrieved Xiao Qing for being neglected, he laughed and said, \"Good, just in time, let’s continue with your Poison Type training today!\"\n\"AWOO!\"\nXiao Qing instantly revived in spirit, its ears perking up, looking at Su Ping with bright eyes. Its tail, which had been dragging on the ground, also began to wag quickly.\nIn that posture, where was the image of the pitifully aggrieved creature from before?\nSu Ping immediately laughed and scolded, \"You rascal! Come with me.\"\nAfter all, he was still going to use Poison System Resources for training. Although there hadn’t been any problems with Xiao Qing’s previous consumption, he still needed to be careful.\nLeading Xiao Qing to the medical room, he skillfully aimed the Life Detector at Xiao Qing, then took out another Poison System Resource.\nInitially, Su Ping had bought four types of Poison System Resources: Heartbane Fruit, Wolfsbane, Oleander, and Devil’s Willow Leaf. Among them, Devil’s Willow Leaf was an Elite Level poison material resource, also a leaf from the ’Devil’s Willow Tree’, a Poison Type, Plant Type Pet Beast.\nExtremely toxic. It couldn’t be used recklessly just yet.\nHaving already administered Wolfsbane and Heartbane Fruit to Xiao Qing, the only one remaining was the Oleander.\nEven Su Ping couldn’t help but marvel at how the more poisonous something was, the more beautiful it seemed. This was true for Xiao Qing, and even more so for this Oleander.\nThe crimson petals looked as if they were beautiful flowers draped in a bright red bridal dress. The dew that preserved them seemed like fresh blood dripping from above.\nAnd this thing was the most poisonous, second only to the Devil’s Willow Leaf.\nIf Xiao Qing hadn’t become completely immune to the previous Wolfsbane and Heartbane Fruit, Su Ping would not dare to let it consume the Oleander rashly.\nHowever, Xiao Qing had gained experience in this process. It opened its mouth, \"AWOO!\"\n\"Hmm? You want to consume it all at once? Are you confident?\"\n\"AWOO!\"\nAfter receiving Xiao Qing’s sure and confident response, Su Ping had no doubt. Xiao Qing was his family and partner. If they were to battle in the future, it would be his most important comrade. In such a situation, he couldn’t not trust Xiao Qing.\nThus, Su Ping didn’t cut it into pieces as he had done before but directly handed the Oleander, which seemed to be soaked in blood, to Xiao Qing. Swallowed by the latter in one gulp,\nXiao Qing wanted to prove that it was no less capable than the Paperman that had recently stolen its master’s attention!\nIn a few swift movements, Xiao Qing swallowed the thing whole and then lay down on the table.\nSoon after, Xiao Qing began to change.\nThe red oleander truly deserved its reputation as the strongest Poison System Resource below the Elite Level.\nIn less than a few minutes, wisps of power fluctuations appeared on Xiao Qing’s body.\nThe next moment, as if these power fluctuations had built up to a peak, they suddenly burst forth!\nA surge of feedback energy transmitted through the Soul Contract.\nXiao Qing’s Level broke through, just like mine, reaching the Ordinary Eighth Rank.\nThe speed of this increase had surpassed that of Little Ones. After all, Little Ones was only at the Ordinary Seventh Rank at this time.\nMoreover, the surge of feedback energy also significantly boosted my spiritual power.\nThe threshold of the Ordinary Eighth Rank, which I had only recently broken through, seemed to shake once more.\nNᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nThis situation excited me, but what I hadn’t expected was that, in the next second, dazzling spots of light appeared all over Xiao Qing’s body. These light spots, akin to fireflies, were very familiar to me; they were just like what I had seen when the Heart of Woods broke through. However, Xiao Qing was different from Woodhead. Woodhead’s light points shone brightly and brilliantly, while the light points flickering on Xiao Qing were deeper and shrouded, as if there was a faint mist swirling around its body. It looked like the shadow of a plague wolf hidden in dark green clouds. This was...\nThe Eye of Truth instantly focused, and as expected, the Mutated Skill \"Mutated Poison Wood Heart\" on Xiao Qing’s list of Skills had evolved from Beginner to Proficient Level:\n[**Mutated Poison Wood Heart (Proficient)**: A special Mutated Skill that merges the powers of Poison and Wood Elements, enhancing the activation efficiency, power, and casting speed of Poison Type and Wood Element Skills. At the same time, it can absorb the essence of plant power for self-recovery and may consume Poison System Resources to accelerate its own Realm advancement.]\nReaching the Proficient Level of the Mutated Poison Wood Heart seemed unremarkable.\nHowever, from the faint green mist emerging from the breathing orifices of Xiao Qing, one could see that its mastery over Poison and the power of its toxins had been further enhanced.\nAnd this increase was likely a qualitative leap compared to before!\nHowever, as I watched Xiao Qing slowly rise to its feet, I sensed a shift within me. Sure enough, as Xiao Qing’s breakthrough and leveling up occurred, pages of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas in my mind began to turn once again.\nOn the Forest Wolf Catalog, new log entries appeared:\n[**Poison Type Mutated Bloodline Pet Beast cultivation has improved.**]\n[**Further analysis of the cause of the Poison Type mutation in Forest Wolves is available; 47,000 Experience Points may be expended from this Catalog to forcefully analyze the cause of the Poison Type bloodline mutation in Forest Wolves and obtain Mutated Cultivation methods.**]\n[**Cultivation improvement of the Forest Wolf Poison Type Mutated Skill \"Mutated Poison Wood Heart\", with the Forest Wolf Catalog providing reference for further enhancement in the direction of Poison Type development, and an additional 200 Experience Points earned.**]\nThe previous points were one thing, but the effectiveness of the oleander consumed this time required significantly fewer Experience Points to reduce the analysis of the Forest Wolf’s Poison Type mutation causes. However, I never expected that a Skill proficiency increase would also yield Experience Points? What’s more critical was that, although not a large sum, those points were the final piece of the puzzle! Because with those 200 Experience Points, my Forest Wolf Catalog’s Experience Points tally had crossed 1,700 points. In other words, the Evolution of the Wanmu Wolf could finally be completed with the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas! Was I, at last, going to master a complete Evolution pathway?",

      "content": "Chapter 63: Chapter 63 Completion Success: The True Wanmu Wolf Evolution Method! (Second Update)\nBack in the living room, Su Ping sat cross-legged on the floor for a while before immersing his consciousness into the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas. His excitement had gradually settled; he knew he had to remain steady at all times, especially since this was the moment his breeding base would take a step further. Being able to research an evolution path for the masses already fell within the scope of a Senior Breeder.\nHow could he not have a sense of ceremony at such a time?\nThus, after calming himself for a while, Su Ping turned his gaze to the Forest Wolf Catalog.\n[Catalog: Forest Wolf]\n[A special Wolf Tribe proficient in using Wood Attribute Skills, with extraordinarily strong Life Force. Adult Forest Wolves are generally Elite Level and are adept at Skills such as Sunlight Absorption, Vine Strangling, Self-Healing, Accelerated Growth, and more.]\n[Current Catalog Level: 2 (1,746/2,000)]\nKnown Evolutionary Atlas, special Cultivation:\n[Heart of Woods Magic Potion: Upon taking this potion, a Forest Wolf can awaken the Skill ’Heart of Woods’ and its Level can be significantly enhanced...]\n[Accelerated Spellcasting Cultivation: By utilizing specific Cultivation methods, training, and nourishing, there’s a chance to comprehend the Skill ’Accelerated Spellcasting’ within ten days.]\n[Wanmu Wolf Evolutionary Form: It requires 1,682 Catalogue Experience Points to perfect this evolutionary path. Would you like to perfect it?]\nThis line of text, which Su Ping had eyed countless times with immense anticipation over the past few days—finally, faced with the question ’Would you like to perfect it?’, he chose ’Yes!’ without a second thought.\nIn an instant, the vast amount of Catalogue Experience Points that had been accumulated over this period flowed away like water. The Forest Wolf Catalog, which had originally been entirely green, immediately became much paler. However, next to the illustration of the Forest Wolf in the Catalog, a faint shadow slowly emerged. The very next moment, this shadow transformed into text that appeared in Su Ping’s mind. It replaced the previous text, becoming the only recorded evolutionary method and path on the Forest Wolf Catalog!\n[Wanmu Wolf Evolutionary Form: This is the Forest Wolf’s further Evolutionary Form based on the Wood Element. It grants preliminary control over the natural plant power bestowed by sunlight and possesses extremely high potential for growth and future development. This stands as the prime option for the first stage of the Forest Wolf evolutionary path.]\n[Cultivation Requirements First Stage: The Evolutionary Body Forest Wolf must not be lower than the Elite Fifth Rank, and the Sunlight Absorption Skill must not be less than proficient.]\n[Cultivation Requirements Second Stage: Thoroughly chew on the fibers of tree wood for consumption, and the process must last no less than three days. During these three days, the Sunlight Absorption Skill must be activated for over forty hours, and the wolf must Take Root in the earth. After three days, the Skill ’Photosynthesis’ will be comprehended.]\n(Note: This stage is a special one. The Evolutionary Body Forest Wolf needs to consume one stem of Wood Spirit Grass and ten drops of Hundred Herbs Juice daily to ensure stability and basic effectiveness in comprehending Photosynthesis. Additionally, within a twenty-meter radius of the rooting site, there must be no other forest or tree-like plants to ensure maximum sunlight exposure. If there are rainy or overcast days, the process can be postponed.)\n[Cultivation Requirements Third Stage: Once the Evolutionary Body Forest Wolf comprehends Photosynthesis, its Photosynthesis Skill must reach the same Level as its own Sunlight Absorption Skill before its Energy is sufficient to reach the evolutionary threshold. Then, with Energy reserves at their peak, the Evolution can begin!]\n(Note 1: This stage is crucial. Even if the Photosynthesis Skill and Sunlight Absorption Skill are not at the same Level, the Wanmu Wolf can still evolve; however, it will completely turn into a plant and die after several days. Furthermore, the higher the base Levels of Photosynthesis and Sunlight Absorption, the greater the Wanmu Wolf’s potential after completing the Evolution.)\n(Note 2: During this stage, the Evolutionary Body Forest Wolf is in a rapid comprehension stage. Greater sunlight intensity speeds up Photosynthesis Skill improvement. Using more resources also accelerates the increase in the Photosynthesis Skill Level. Suggested resources for this stage include: Smiling Sunflower Seeds (consumption), Sunlight Spring Water (soaking), Lungs of Nature (breathing), and Sun Crystals (consumption).)\n[Cultivation Requirement Phase Four: The final stage. After completion of Evolution, maintain physical activity for over three hours during daylight and for more than ten days; otherwise, there is a risk of mental and physical rigidity.]\n\"Phew...\" Su Ping let out a long breath, his opened eyes filled with shock.ᴛhis ᴜpdated by\nA top-tier potential Evolutionary Form!\nEven the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas rated it so highly; it went without saying that the Evolution of the Wanmu Wolf must be far from simple. However, the complex stages of Evolution, as well as the many critical points that needed careful attention, could lead to dire results if any issue arose.\nUndoubtedly, among Sun Chaoju’s many experiments, it was quite evident that the mistakes were in the direction of Cultivation. It could be seen that the essence of Sun Chaoju’s many failures likely lay in the biggest problems that occurred in the third stage. That is, the two Special Skills, Sunlight Absorption and Photosynthesis, needed to be unified before Evolution could commence. They had to be at the same Level to start evolving. Only then would it not result in the Forest Wolf turning into wood; otherwise, no matter how many resources had been used in Cultivation and what Level had been reached, the imbalance of these two Skills would always lead to such an end.\nBut it must be said, such evolutionary conditions, not just for Sun Chaoju, but even for me, would have been unimaginable without the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas.\nDuring the third stage, the process of the Evolutionary Body Forest Wolf absorbing sunlight would greatly accelerate its comprehension speed of Photosynthesis, making it possible for the Photosynthesis Skill to catch up with the Sunlight Absorption Skill. However, during this stage, neither Sun Chaoju nor the entire Wolf Den had realized this aspect. The resources they used were all Wood Element and Life Series resources, which instead made the Forest Wolf’s Energy accumulate faster, speeding up the Evolution process.\nAt that time, using such resources wasn’t to accelerate the Evolution of the Evolutionary Body Forest Wolf, but to hasten its Death!\nSu Ping felt somewhat emotional. That original Forest Wolf must have had extremely high Talent; otherwise, it wouldn’t have sensed this profound Evolution method of the Wanmu Wolf from its bloodline. It was just a pity. Even if Sun Chaoju and the Wolf Den had not intervened, if that Forest Wolf had merely absorbed sunlight for Photosynthesis learning and training, it might have had a chance to complete the Evolution perfectly. But in the end, Sun Chaoju inundated it with Wood Element resources, which accelerated the process. Ultimately, it was forced to evolve, and naturally, it could only turn into a plant and die, decaying completely.\nWhat a pity.\nHowever, Su Ping quickly snapped back to reality. He instantly became invigorated.\nHe certainly wouldn’t repeat Sun Chaoju’s mistakes. With the complete information from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, he was fully confident in the success rate, even without attempting it himself. In that case, what was there to hesitate about? Time to get started!",

      "content": "Chapter 64: Chapter 64: Sun Crystal! The resources needed by Wanmu Wolf. (Third update)\nClearly, Su Ping’s first cultivation target was still Old Sha.\nOld Sha was already very old. As he aged, the difficulty of his evolution would likely increase. Taking advantage of his previous breakthroughs, Su Ping really didn’t want to delay this any longer.\nMoreover, Su Ping also believed in the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas. The Heart of Woods magic potion previously, and the subsequent connection-sharing ability, had both proved the absolute miraculousness of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas. This time would certainly be no exception.\nThe most important step in cultivating the Wanmu Wolf’s evolution undoubtedly lay in the level of Photosynthesis, which had to be the same as the level of Sunlight Absorption to prevent complete plant-ification after evolution. The Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas’s Evolutionary Atlas also provided a clear analysis. At this stage, using those resources could speed up the advancement of the Photosynthesis skill level.\nSince Old Sha’s Sunlight Absorption was at the Perfect Level, in order to elevate Photosynthesis to the Perfect Level during the energy absorption phase, it was not only imperative to have abundant sunlight but also to utilize these resources: Smiling Sunflower seeds, Sunlight Spring Water, Lungs of Nature, and Sun Crystals.Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nSu Ping took a slight breath. The seeds of the Smiling Sunflower were not a big deal, just ordinary materials. He could buy a huge pile at a moment’s notice with his current wealth.\nThe Sunlight Spring Water was also manageable. It was only Elite Level, and as the preferred spring water for Plant Type pet beasts, it was widely circulated on the market and not difficult to obtain.\nBut the Lungs of Nature were not so easily acquired. A Commander Level resource that could aid in breathing and purify the impurities within both pet beasts and Beast Tamers, it was indeed a rare resource.\nAs for Sun Crystals? Monarch Level resources, they were even said to be materials used in the evolution of some pet beasts, extremely rare.\nAlthough Su Ping wasn’t certain if Old Sha’s evolution required Sun Crystals, Old Sha was one of Su Ping’s most important family members. Unlike the previous cultivation magic potions, even if the Heart of Woods magic potion was ineffective, it would pose no life-threatening danger.\nHowever, this evolution was different. He had to be fully prepared beforehand.\nThus, whether it was the scarce Lungs of Nature or even Sun Crystals, Su Ping had to obtain them to ensure absolute security in the evolution!\nWith this in mind, Su Ping let out a sigh.\nHe took out his phone. The app on the marketplace really caught his eye.\nAfter entering the keywords, two leaves indeed appeared before him. Yes, these were the Lungs of Nature.\nHowever, after a glance, Su Ping’s heart cooled slightly.\n[Lungs of Nature: Wood Element Commander Level resource, usable by both pet beasts and Beast Tamers, a rare and precious resource, value: 8,000,000]\nIt wasn’t about affordability. In fact, over the past couple of days, Su Ping had completed another Heart of Woods cultivation, pocketing over four million in after-tax income. Just by breeding another Forest Wolf, he could afford the price.\nBut the problem was, if a Commander Level treasure like the Lungs of Nature was already so expensive, how much would Monarch Level Sun Crystals cost?\nClearly, tens of millions were a given. The question was just how many tens of millions it would be.\nIndeed, the higher the level of resources, the more expensive they became.\nOrdinary Level resources, even those rare ones, cost only several thousand or just over ten thousand at most.\nAt the Elite Tier, prices could increase more than tenfold.\nCommanding Rank resources were no longer something the average person could afford.\nAnd at the Monarch Level, an ordinary Beast Tamer might struggle their entire life to gather enough for even one such item.\nAs for Emperor Level, those items were simply out of reach for ordinary people. They naturally couldn’t be measured in money.\nThis is troubling indeed,\nSu Ping thought, rubbing his brow.\nWhat could be more frustrating than having fully developed an evolution method but being unable to proceed due to a lack of materials? Why is it that money is always so hard to come by?\nBut obviously, even with money, one might not be able to get what they need. Because on the app’s marketplace, even though there was an icon, two large grey words stood tall: Out of Stock.\nWhere can I get this thing?\nImmediately, Su Ping thought of his neighbors. Knowing the background of Yuntian Resort, and that they were in need of his help, Su Ping was somewhat puzzled why they hadn’t approached him yet. But he was confident that if he proposed the condition, it wouldn’t be a problem for Tianyun Group.\nHowever, Su Ping immediately dismissed this option. Tianyun could indeed do it, but he was absolutely not going to give up on the Paperman and that secret realm. From Qin Xiaoxue’s words, one could discern the value of the secret realm.\nShould I ask Qin Xiaoxue for a loan then?\nQin Xiaoxue would definitely lend it to him, but Su Ping did not want to ask for this favor.\nHe rubbed his head.\nShould I consider getting a loan? That also doesn’t seem very reliable.\nHowever, whether or not there was a way to make money, even if Su Ping managed to finish cultivating all the Forest Wolves for the clients as scheduled, he still needed to know where to buy the materials and how much they would cost, right? With that thought, the first person Su Ping thought of was Vice President Liu of the Breeder Association!\nOver the phone, the same hearty voice came through:\n\"So you’re calling me again so soon, Su? Could it be that you’ve already completed the evolution research for the Wanmu Wolf?\"\n\"I have a lead, but it’s not completed yet. I’m calling you, Old Liu, because I wanted to ask you about something.\"\nSu Ping’s voice caused Vice President Liu to pause, glancing suspiciously at the phone. Clearly, Liu had only asked casually; after all, he knew the level of his own disciple, Sun Chaoju, who had wasted a lot of time, energy, and money without success. How could it be that easy?\nNow, Su Ping is telling me he already has a lead?\nOld Liu was momentarily at a loss for how to respond.\n\"I wanted to ask if you knew where in Linzhou, or in Jianghai Province, one could buy Sun Crystals?\"\nSu Ping’s question snapped Vice President Liu back to reality, and he quickly said:\n\"Sun Crystals? Why go to someone’s place for that? The Breeder Association has those kinds of resources!\"\nUpon hearing this, Su Ping was overjoyed:\n\"That’s great, Old Liu, how much does one of those things cost?\"\n\"Money?\"\nVice President Liu was taken aback for a moment, then said in a somewhat strange tone:\n\"Su, have you never visited the Breeder Association before?\"\nSu Ping felt a bit embarrassed, \"Well, I’ve been quite busy.\"\n\"Then this is perfect. Tomorrow is the day I give my lecture. Come to the Breeder Association, and you’ll find out. The association doesn’t want your money.\"\nTomorrow is the lecture day?\nSu Ping was taken aback before it dawned on him that ever since he began the Heart of Woods cultivations, he had seldom gone out, almost forgetting the passage of time. Now that he checked, it was already the end of the month.\nSu Ping perked up. After hanging up the phone, he ordered all the low-level materials needed for the Wanmu Wolf’s evolution, and then, the next morning, for the first time, he locked his front door and took the bus and subway to the Linzhou City Breeder Association Center.",

      "content": "Chapter 65: Chapter 65: Breeder Association, Start the Class! (Four more)\n\"Wow, this is just too big!\" Su Ping couldn’t help but exclaim.\nIt was one thing to look from the outside. Upon entering, the first thing that greeted him was this vast breeding hall. It featured numerous windows, various functions, and even some battle arenas within.\nIts sheer size truly lived up to its reputation as one of Jianghai Province’s landmarks.\nThough the crowd was dense, it was not cramped. Some even released their Pet Beasts to walk alongside them. The only common factor was that everyone here was in a hurry, evidently with clear objectives in mind.\nSu Ping glanced around casually. Vice President Liu’s class started at nine-thirty, and its location was on the second floor. With less than an hour to go, he was in no rush to head up yet.\nSu Ping wandered for a bit, then turned his gaze to the vast training and combat area. This place, besides the various service windows, had the most spectators. Clearly, wherever one was, Pet Beast battles were always a top draw.\nSu Ping walked over, and the first battle arena that came into view made him stop in his tracks. The Beast Tamer on the platform above was handling a Forest Wolf as his Pet Beast. What’s more, its Level wasn’t high; it was also at the Ordinary Level.\nIt wasn’t surprising that there would be a high number of Forest Wolves in Linzhou, one of their places of origin.\nSu Ping found a spot and watched the competition above, nodding occasionally.\nThat buzz-cut youth actually had some skill,\nhe noted. Under the youth’s augmentation and command, his Pet Beast quickly dispatched its opponent.\nThe battle ended, and both competitors left the arena. The buzz-cut youth glanced around and then sat down next to Su Ping, rubbing the Forest Wolf that had just performed valiantly. Then, he noticed his Forest Wolf continuously staring at a young Beast Tamer of similar age sitting nearby.\nThe buzz-cut youth, being an outgoing and cheerful type, saw that his Pet Beast seemed interested in the person next to him and smiled at Su Ping, saying, \"Brother, you were watching so intently just now. Are you a Forest Wolf Beast Tamer too?\"\nSu Ping nodded and smiled, reaching out to stroke the Forest Wolf’s mane.\nThe buzz-cut youth was taken aback.\nDoesn’t he know his own Pet Beast’s personality? Wolf Pets are pack-oriented yet proud, generally not taking kindly to Beast Tamers other than their owner. But why is it so docile with this guy? Not only allowing its mane to be stroked but also squinting its eyes in comfort?\nThe buzz-cut youth became more interested and asked, \"What brings you to the Breeder Association, buddy? I’m Zheng Yong. If you need anything done, just say the word. I’m quite familiar with this place.\"\nSu Ping smiled and replied, \"I’m here for a class; there’s one today...\"\nBefore he could finish, the young man’s eyes widened. \"Forest Wolf, a class? What a coincidence! No wonder my Ba Tian likes you so much. Turns out you’re no ordinary person either, brother!\"\n\"Huh?\" Now it was genuinely Su Ping’s turn to be surprised. He looked at Zheng Yong with astonishment, asking, \"Could it be, Brother Zheng, that you’re also...?\"\nZheng Yong laughed heartily. \"Is it President Liu Fuhai’s class?\"\nOnly when Zheng Yong mentioned Vice President Liu’s name was Su Ping certain. He looked at the other young man in surprise and nodded. Zheng Yong didn’t seem much older than him, perhaps by only a year or two.\nHis Level as a Beast Tamer is one thing, but to think he’s already a Breeder? To become a Breeder at this age is quite impressive! Otherwise, why would Jin Cheng be so arrogant? That’s the basis for his pride! After all, my own Intermediate Beast Tamer certificate and assessment were obtained through a cheat. I truly admire and respect those who genuinely possess breeding Talent at such a young age.\nZheng Yong seemed quite pleased with this serendipitous meeting. His laughter drew glances from people nearby, as if he were deliberately showing off. \"Hahaha, no wonder! Being able to attend President Liu’s class is indeed a rare honor.\"\nSu Ping nodded as well.\nMy luck is indeed quite good. Meeting Qin Xiaoxue, and through her, getting to know Vice President Liu, has certainly saved me a lot of trouble and hassle. And Vice President Liu’s abilities are undeniable. A High-Level Beastmaster specializing in Wolf Pets—he’s the only one in Jianghai Province. Even across the entire Dragon Nation, he’s a renowned figure. Being able to attend his public lecture is truly a rare opportunity.\n\"It is rare indeed,\" Su Ping said. \"Although I haven’t personally experienced Old Liu’s breeding expertise, I’ve long heard of it. I hope I can learn a few things from him this time.\"\nZheng Yong, however, waved his hand. \"It’s too hard to learn anything directly from Old Liu. After all, he’s lecturing those Breeders. Right now, I’m just hoping that when those Breeders in class get hands-on with our Pet Beasts, they can give us some pointers. If they can help us find suitable training methods, we can avoid many detours! I really hope to break through to the Elite Level soon. Once I reach the Elite Level and get a second Pet Beast, I’ll have some confidence in passing next year’s Beast Tamer assessment. Otherwise, I’ll have to wait for the next round, but by then, I’ll be twenty-two, which is a bit too late.\"\nAt this point, Zheng Yong’s eyes lit up with anticipation and joy.\nHowever, Su Ping was momentarily taken aback, then slightly furrowed his brows.\nWhy does this sound so strange?\nBut evidently, the friendly and straightforward Zheng Yong didn’t notice Su Ping’s surprise and continued with a smile, \"Oh, right, brother! Why don’t you summon your Pet Beast too? We can go up and have a friendly match! Let my Ba Tian see the strength of a Forest Wolf Beast Tamer who was also chosen by the Breeder Association!\"\nChosen? Forest Wolf Beast Tamer?\nSu Ping clicked his tongue.\nHave I misunderstood something? What Zheng Yong and I are talking about... they don’t seem to be the same thing, do they?\nHe was a bit uncertain.\nHowever, upon hearing Zheng Yong’s words, he quickly shook his head. \"Better not. Class is about to start soon. It wouldn’t be good if Vice President Liu caught us being late.\"\nHearing this, Zheng Yong nodded. \"That’s true. Ba Tian, go get some rest. I’ll call you out again in a bit!\"\nWith that said, Zheng Yong recalled the Forest Wolf named Ba Tian into his Beast Taming Space. Then he looked towards Su Ping and asked, \"By the way, brother, what’s your name?\"\n\"Su Ping.\"\n\"Eh? Your name sounds familiar, like I’ve heard it somewhere before?\" Zheng Yong scratched his head.\n\"Is that so? It might be a common name,\" Su Ping replied, giving him a speechless sidelong glance.\nZheng Yong didn’t dwell on it. After chatting for a while longer, he glanced at his watch and hurriedly said, \"It’s 9:20 already! Class starts in ten minutes. Let’s head up to the second floor.\"\nFollow current novels on NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt",

(One more)\nThe second floor of the Breeder Association housed various meeting rooms, offices, auditoriums, and classrooms.\nAs for some Breeders’ laboratories, they were not located in this main association building.\nSo, this main building actually only had two floors.\nHowever, despite its modest number of floors, the spacious lobby on the first floor indicated that the second floor was also quite expansive.\nSo, if Zheng Yong hadn’t been there, Su Ping might have struggled to find his way alone.\nZheng Yong had mentioned earlier that he was quite familiar with the Breeder Association, and it seemed this was no exaggeration.\nHe took the lead, weaving through the corridors, and brought Su Ping to a classroom door on the second floor.\nIt was worth noting that, unlike other areas with only a few scattered staff members, the entrance to this classroom was bustling with people.\nJust as Su Ping arrived, a few older individuals smiled and entered the classroom.\nThe relatively younger Beast Tamers sitting outside the classroom watched those entering with a mixture of excitement and envy.\n\"Alright, let’s wait here for a bit,\" Zheng Yong said, taking a seat on one of the benches outside the classroom.\nSu Ping blinked.\nHe wasn’t foolish and quickly realized that the seats outside the door were for those Wolf Pet Beast Tamers waiting to be selected.\nThose who had just entered the classroom were the Breeders waiting for Old Liu’s lecture.\nThough they had all arrived together, their distinct statuses clearly separated them as if by an invisible boundary.\nStill, it made sense. Even a Junior Breeder held a much higher status than an ordinary Beast Tamer. After all, anyone over eighteen who had contracted their first Pet Beast could be considered a Beast Tamer.\nBut becoming a Breeder recognized by the Association was far more difficult.\nSu Ping wasn’t particularly concerned about these distinctions; he was fine sitting outside. After all, he didn’t know anyone in the Breeder Association.\nGoing inside would just mean a boring wait.\nHe’d rather chat with Zheng Yong.\nUnfortunately, just as Su Ping settled into his seat, a voice came from behind him,\n\"Su Ping?\"\nTurning his head, he saw Sun Chaoju, whom he hadn’t seen for a few days. Sure enough, Sun Chaoju stood not far behind him, accompanied by a slightly younger man who also looked at Su Ping with surprise.\nSince their last encounter, Su Ping’s opinion of Sun Chaoju, the Intermediate Breeder from Shuhua City, had improved slightly. Hearing him speak, Su Ping nodded with a smile,\n\"Breeder Sun, you’re here too?\"\n\"Of course. How could I miss Instructor Liu’s class?\" Sun Chaoju said with a teasing tone. \"Why are you sitting out here? Come on in. I’ll introduce you to some friends in the Breeder Association so they can meet you, the big celebrity of the moment.\" He was right, too.\nThe ordinary Beast Tamers in the first-floor lobby might not have been aware, but most of the Breeders registered with the Breeder Association already knew of Su Ping.\nThe reason was simply his youth.\nBesides, in Linzhou City, despite its size, secrets were hard to keep within specialized circles.\nEveryone in those circles knew that Sun Chaoju, one of Vice President Liu’s disciples, had lost a Forest Wolf Cultivation contest to a recently graduated student!\nAnd it had been a thoroughly convincing defeat.\nThis time, Vice President Liu’s Wolf Pet course was titled: ’On the Evolutionary Paths and Growth Potential of Wolf Pet Cultivation, and Subsequent Training.’\nThis course was relatively advanced. Even with Vice President Liu’s excellent teaching skills, it wasn’t something the average Breeder could easily grasp.\nPet Beast Evolution was one of the most crucial topics for Breeders.\nOne reason so many people had gathered this time was to see for themselves what this young Genius Breeder, currently making waves in Linzhou City, was really like.\nSeeing Sun Chaoju’s eager invitation, Su Ping felt somewhat helpless. He glanced at Zheng Yong, who looked surprised, and said,\n\"I have something to attend to. I should get going.\"\nZheng Yong cautiously glanced at Sun Chaoju. He didn’t recognize Sun Chaoju personally, but the badge on the man’s chest was clear: an Intermediate Breeder.\nHe hastily said,\n\"It’s alright, you go ahead.\"\nSu Ping nodded and followed Sun Chaoju toward the classroom. As they walked, Sun Chaoju laughed and said,\n\"Su Ping, this is Breeder Mu Hang. He’s an Intermediate Breeder. Don’t be fooled by his youth; he’s younger than me but specializes in breeding Shadow Wolves, a rarity in our Jianghai Province...\"\n\"So, you’re Breeder Mu. I’ve heard of you.\"\n\"Haha... Old Sun, you’re teasing me. Who could be as young as Little Su? In my opinion...\"\nTheir voices faded as they entered the classroom, leaving Zheng Yong outside, looking utterly confused.\nJust then, a young man—clearly another young Beast Tamer who knew Zheng Yong—walked over.\n\"Old Zheng, who’s that kid? He seems quite familiar with those two Breeders.\"ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt\nZheng Yong glanced at the speaker, equally puzzled.\nHow would he know who that kid was?\nWho could have guessed that a random passerby he’d met during a scuffle in the lobby downstairs was someone important?\nBesides, he’d never seen that unfamiliar face before.\nThey had gotten along, but it wasn’t proper to pry into someone’s background upon a first meeting, was it?\nZheng Yong hesitated. \"I don’t know,\" he said. \"But I guess he might be related to that Breeder?\"\nHe wasn’t too sure himself.\nHowever, judging by the Breeder’s warm behavior just now, they seemed quite close, didn’t they?\nThinking this over, Zheng Yong felt a twinge of envy.\nHaving relatives or friends who were Breeders was an unimaginable advantage for a Beast Tamer’s future development.\nIt could save one from so many unnecessary detours.\nHe did have some connections within the Breeder Association; otherwise, he wouldn’t have had the chance to attend Vice President Liu’s class as a ’model’.\nBut compared to an Intermediate Breeder, his connections were still lacking.\n\"What’s his name?\" the young man beside him asked again, curious.\nZheng Yong thought for a moment before replying,\n\"Su Ping. I think his name is Su Ping.\"\n\"Su Ping? That sounds familiar... like I’ve heard it somewhere before.\"\nZheng Yong gave the young man another doubtful look.\nThis guy thought it sounded familiar too?\n\"What are you two still chattering about? Get ready, President Liu has arrived.\"",

He specializes in breeding Snow Wolves. Old Zhao is the most experienced among us,\" someone introduced.\n\"Hello, Mr. Zhao...\"\n\"Oh, oh, oh, a hero emerges from youth...\"\n\"Su Ping, this is Breeder Yang He. Old Yang is not a simple man; not only does he specialize in breeding Sand Wolves, but he also has deep research on plant-type Pet Beasts like the Poplar variety,\" someone continued.The most update n0vels are published on NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\n\"...\"\nIt was evident that Sun Chaoju was quite adept at social interactions. He knew all seven Intermediate Breeders present and, by the looks of it, had good relations with all of them.\nSu Ping didn’t put on any airs either. Everyone helps carry the sedan chair; unless there was a special circumstance, there was no need to be overly distant. The same went for the even more numerous Junior Breeders.\nMoreover, although Su Ping didn’t particularly enjoy social occasions, it was undeniable that establishing good relationships with these people was necessary.\nWhat if he could get some benefits from them?\nSun Chaoju’s Accelerated Casting, transformed through the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, had remarkable effects. Those who could stand here were obviously elites, each with their own Pet Beast Cultivation Skills.\nThis time, no one showed any disdain for Su Ping’s young age. Those who had made it this far were no fools; Su Ping’s youth wasn’t a detriment but rather an incredibly positive factor.\nIt’s better to deceive an old man than to deceive a youth in poverty.\nMoreover, this particular youth wasn’t ’poor’ at all.\nAfter Sun Chaoju’s formidable achievements, even the coldest Breeder cracked a smile and nodded when introduced to Su Ping.\nSu Ping remembered these people, exchanged contact information with them, and then started talking about recent events.\nThe Shadow Wolf Breeder Mu Hang, who clearly had the best relationship with Sun Chaoju, joked with a laugh, \"You sly old Sun, secretly discovering a new Evolution path for the Forest Wolf and not sharing it with your brothers. Now look, Su Ping has won.\"\n\"Su Ping winning was something I wholeheartedly accepted. Besides, that Wanmu Wolf was too difficult. I experimented with materials worth hundreds of millions, but in the end, ah, I can only pin my hopes on Su Ping...\" he trailed off, and his expression said it all about the outcome.\nNobody felt much sympathy for him, and someone even teased with a laugh, \"This guy is putting on an act again. I’m torn right now. I hope Su Ping can work out a stable Evolution path for the Wanmu Wolf, bringing fame to Jianghai Province once more.\n\"Yet, I don’t want it to succeed so that old Sun can boast about his discovery and earn a huge pile of Points.\"\nAt those words, everyone turned their gaze to Su Ping. Breeder Zhao, the oldest among them—who, despite being as senior as Vice President Liu, looked more ancient due to a lower Beast Taming Level—asked with a smile, \"Su Ping, are you confident?\"\nWas I confident? I had already figured it out and was just waiting to gather the materials at the Breeder Association before heading back to start the formal Evolution and Cultivation.\nRegrettably, Su Ping clearly couldn’t state this outright.\nAn Evolution route that Sun Chaoju nearly spent two years on and couldn’t develop, yet I completely figured it out in less than a week? This was no longer about being exceptionally talented; it was astonishing. Although unlikely to end up sliced for study, there was no need to attract such attention at this time.\nSo, in response to Mr. Zhao’s question, Su Ping simply smiled. \"I’m confident!\"\n\"Confidence is a good thing. It seems that Linzhou might produce the youngest Senior Breeder in Jianghai Province!\"\nA smile-filled voice resonated from a distance, and everyone looked up. Sure enough, Vice President Liu had already entered the classroom unnoticed.\n\"Good day, President Liu.\"\n\"Mr. Liu!\"\n\"Hello, Old Liu!\"\nA series of greetings ensued, and Old Liu responded to each with a nod and a smile. Then, quite swiftly, his expression turned serious. \"Alright, let’s save catching up for later. Everyone knows what today’s topic is.\"\nOld Liu got into the groove incredibly fast. He stepped directly onto the podium above, which gave Su Ping a sudden flashback to a few months prior. However, the material Old Liu taught was much deeper and more complex than the basics imparted at the Beast Taming Academy a few months ago.\nYet, the lesson Old Liu was teaching now actually had some relevance to Su Ping. It was about the direction of Wolf Pet Evolutionary Bodies, their growth and development potential, and their subsequent Cultivation!\nThe lecture began with the direction of these Evolutionary Bodies.\nWolf Pets, with their broad appeal among Beast Tamers, had many developed evolutionary pathways. For example, the Forest Wolf had evolved forms like the higher-ranking Forest Wolf and the Elf Wolf.\nOf course, I now know about the Crown Wolf Emperor, the highest-level superior Evolutionary Body I’ve learned of so far.\nAnd Old Liu’s class was all about deciding future Evolution based on skill levels, the Pet Beast’s character, and developmental trajectory. From this, they would even deduce and experiment with new evolutionary paths, noting the issues and characteristics to look out for.\nThe course was deep, but Old Liu explained it in a very simple way. Even a half-baked student like Su Ping could understand it.\nIn fact, Su Ping was so engrossed in the hour-long lecture that he didn’t feel the passage of time at all.\nIf possible, I truly wish such classes would never end.\nThe reason was simple: just five minutes ago, a new notification had appeared in the journal and record section under the Forest Wolf entry in his Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas:\n[Your understanding of Forest Wolf evolutionary analysis has deepened, corresponding breeder knowledge increased, Forest Wolf Catalog Experience Points +250.]\nCould attending classes have such benefits? Well, that made sense. For each Catalog entry in the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, one needed a comprehensive understanding and recognition of the corresponding Pet Beast. My ongoing close association with those Forest Wolves was indeed for this very purpose.\nThus, Su Ping listened more attentively than anyone, prompting Old Liu, who had been quietly observing him from the podium, to nod approvingly to himself.\nFinally, when Old Liu at the podium paused to take a drink of water, the class evidently moved into a new phase. \"Okay, now let’s do a test. A few colleagues, come up. Based on the Ability types and even the temperament of your Pet Beasts, analyze the corresponding evolutionary choices...\"\n\"Su Ping...\"\nAs expected, Su Ping was the first to be called. He was an Intermediate Breeder specializing in Forest Wolves. Counting him and Sun Chaoju, there were three such specialists in total, but only Su Ping himself came forward. The others who came forward were Breeders of other Wolf Pets.\nAnd all who came up were Intermediate Breeders; after all, the topic of Pet Beast Evolution and Cultivation already fell under the purview of Senior Breeders. Junior Breeders could, at best, only grasp the basics.\nOnce a few people stepped forward, Old Liu turned to his assistant and said, \"Alright, let those little fellows who have prepared their Pet Beasts come over.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 68: Chapter 68: He’s Glowing! (Three Updates)\nZheng Yong, along with more than ten other Beast Tamers, waited outside the door.\nThese Pet Beasts, prepared to serve as ’models’ for the Breeders, were offered as experimental subjects for the class at no cost.\nHowever, this free class opportunity was fiercely contested by countless well-connected people.ᴛhis ᴜpdated by\nThis was because, at this moment, the class was being taught by Vice President Liu, a Senior Breeder, and all the attendees were also Breeders.\nUsing their Pet Beasts as experimental subjects naturally meant they would be analyzed based on the knowledge presented in the class.\nEven if something was incorrect, Vice President Liu would point it out directly. This was equivalent to having a group of Breeders, with a Senior Breeder presiding, offer clear and precise guidance on the growth of their own Pet Beasts.\nSuch an opportunity, let alone being free, would see many people eager to pay for it if they could.\nIn fact, some present had indeed used backdoor connections through the Breeder Association staff and paid for such a chance.\nIt didn’t much concern others, but Zheng Yong couldn’t help but peek into the classroom throughout the hour.\nHis brows were tightly furrowed.\nWhy hasn’t my little brother come out after such a long time?\nThe problem is, the class has already started!\nCould there be another door to the classroom that I haven’t seen? Did my little brother actually leave a long time ago?\nBut if he left, wouldn’t he have gone straight home? That doesn’t make sense either.\nA class by President Liu—frankly, unless it’s a life-or-death matter, what could be more important than this?\nSo where is he now?\nZheng Yong didn’t know, and at this moment, there was clearly no time to dawdle. An assistant hurried out from the front of the classroom, urging, \"Go in quickly, they’re waiting for you. Keep an eye on your little creatures and don’t cause any trouble!\"\nAfter this urging, the figures went inside one by one, Zheng Yong among them.\n\"Instructor Liu, there are a total of thirteen Beast Tamers: three Forest Wolf Tamers, two Shadow Wolf Tamers, two Sand Wolf Tamers, three Snow Wolf Tamers, two Flame Wolf Tamers, and one Hunting Wolf Tamer.\"\nIt was quite a collection, almost a complete set of Tamers specializing in several basic types of Wolf Pets.\nZheng Yong suddenly became extremely nervous.\nThis was the first time he was seeing the elder at the head of the room up close; previously, he had mostly seen him on television and in various official media.\nHowever, Zheng Yong was soon stunned.\nBecause standing right next to that elder was a figure with a beaming smile. This person seemed to notice Zheng Yong’s gaze and even blinked, apparently greeting him.\nWhat’s he doing there?\nBut obviously, now didn’t seem to be the time to ask. A terrifying, unbidden speculation surfaced in the depths of his mind.\n\"Alright, after the assignments, summon your Pet Beasts, and then we can begin the analysis and explanation one by one.\"\nThe six Intermediate Level Breeders who had come forward, including Su Ping, corresponded to the specialized Breeders for the six types of Wolf Pets present.\nClearly, as a Forest Wolf Tamer, Zheng Yong was naturally assigned to the only specialized Forest Wolf Breeder present.\nAn assistant quickly approached Zheng Yong, leading him and two others to stand behind Su Ping. With a beaming smile, the assistant said to Su Ping, \"Breeder Su, sorry to trouble you with them.\"\nSu Ping smiled and quickly shook his head. \"No trouble at all.\"\nThen, the assistant addressed the three people behind Zheng Yong, including Zheng Yong himself, \"Pay attention. This is Su Ping, an Intermediate Breeder, and also a newly specialized Intermediate Forest Wolf Breeder.\"\nThe three of them looked at Su Ping, who was younger than they were, and were completely dumbfounded. Zheng Yong, in particular, stared with his mouth agape at Su Ping, who stood just two people away from him.\nWhile the three were dumbstruck, the assistant, clearly past the initial shock of the news, furrowed his brows and said, \"What are you standing there in a daze for? Greet Breeder Su already!\"\nOnly then did the three of them come to their senses, speaking along with the other Beast Tamers who had already been assigned, \"Greetings, Breeder Su.\"\n\"Hello, hello. Zheng Yong, let’s start with you. Summon your Ba Tian for me to take a look!\" Su Ping said.\nThe others looked at Zheng Yong with surprise. Some clearly recognized that this Breeder Su was the same young man who had arrived with Zheng Yong.\nBut no one would have thought that this Breeder (Su Ping) was acquainted with such a person—the ’Long Aotian of the common battle arena’ (Zheng Yong)!\nFeeling the envious looks from his companions, Zheng Yong quickly summoned his Ba Tian.\nSu Ping wasn’t there to show off; he had listened very carefully to the previous lecture.\nAlthough his abilities were genuine, not just inflated claims, many pairs of eyes were now fixed on him.\nEveryone was curious how such a young graduate could become an Intermediate Breeder.\nSu Ping really didn’t want his success to be attributed to mere luck or anything similar.\nSo, he had no interest at that moment in figuring out what the three before him were thinking.\nInstead, he meticulously observed the three Forest Wolves. Fortunately, the Eye of Truth could ascertain some things, though using Telepathic Communication was relatively more subtle.\nAfter some examination, it didn’t take long for Su Ping to have a clear understanding in his mind.\nVice President Liu, who had just returned from attending to the Tamer with the lone Hunting Wolf, saw that Su Ping had already begun to write his opinions on the evolution of the three Forest Wolves. He smiled and walked over.\n\"Su Ping, just say it directly, no need to write it down. Let the others hear your perspective as well.\"\nActually, this wasn’t difficult.\nThe evolutionary pathways of a Forest Wolf are closely tied to its own abilities. The real difficulty lies in deducing other evolutionary directions based on the differing strengths of the cultivated Forest Wolf, and then to extrapolate from there. This involved discerning the possibility of new evolutionary pathways by analyzing existing ones.\nSu Ping didn’t act coy and directly voiced his analysis.\nIt included the content of Old Liu’s lecture, his observations of Sun Chaoju’s cultivation of the Wanmu Wolf, the public analysis and retroactive inference based on the evolution results of the Wanmu Wolf displayed through the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, and his own understanding.\nFacing so many Breeders, Su Ping didn’t feel any stage fright.\nEven Vice President Liu stepped aside, yielding the stage to Su Ping.\nZheng Yong stood to the side, watching Su Ping speak eloquently on the podium. Vice President Liu nodded beside him from time to time, and the few remaining Intermediate Breeders below concentrated intently. Other Intermediate Breeders couldn’t help but turn from their own analyses to observe. Even the larger number of Junior Breeders looked up with admiration. Seeing all this, Zheng Yong finally seemed to come to his senses.\nAt that moment, he didn’t know if it was an illusion.\nZheng Yong suddenly felt as if he saw a figure, someone his own age or perhaps even younger, seemingly glowing.\nMoreover, it glowed so brightly that he could hardly look directly at it.\nIt was as if only then did he belatedly realize.\nI’ve just made the acquaintance of a truly remarkable person!",

      "content": "Chapter 69: Chapter 69 Credit Reward System, Sun Crystal Acquired! (Four Updates)\nThe course neared its end, having stretched from morning into the afternoon. Finally, it reached the last topic Old Liu had mentioned:\n\"The Cultivation of Evolutionary Body Pet Beasts, in essence, is the same as that of other Pet Beasts. However, I believe all of you are extraordinary individuals and naturally understand that Pet Beast Skills are divided by levels, and Skills are also categorized into Common Skills and Super-Rank Skills!\"Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn\nEven Su Ping felt a jolt of excitement upon hearing this.\nSuper-Rank Skills.\nThis is a domain I’ve never heard of or encountered before,\nSu Ping thought. It was only previously, in passing, that he had caught a glimpse of this subject.\nIt was rumored that every Super-Rank Skill was exceptionally powerful, with a significant gap existing between Common Skills and Super-Rank Skills. But as to what exactly Super-Rank Skills were or how they came into being, Su Ping honestly didn’t know.\nHowever, when Old Liu reached this point, instead of continuing on this topic, he shifted back to discussing the usual Cultivation conditions.\nThis left Su Ping feeling as if a cat were scratching at his heart, yet there was nothing he could do about it.\nIt was not until the class was about to end that Old Liu seemed to summarize with a smile, saying, \"The primary goal in Cultivating an Evolutionary Body Pet Beast is to develop a Super-Rank Skill, but not all Pet Beasts possess the potential and qualifications for it. Now, back to the question at hand: how do Super-Rank Skills come about?\n\"Certainly, some Pet Beasts born with extraordinary Racial Potential, once they naturally grow to maturity, have a certain chance of mastering Super-Rank Skills on their own. However, such Pet Beast species are too rare and are not something ordinary people can acquire. Therefore, the acquisition of Super-Rank Skills is mainly accomplished by Breeders.\"\nHmm? Su Ping stared at Old Liu in astonishment.\nRegrettably, Old Liu seemed to have timed his cliffhanger perfectly, knowing no one would dare to strike him, and he broke off there. \"Alright, the content regarding Super-Rank Skills is not something you can access at this point. In summary, just focus on doing well in Cultivation. Class dismissed!\"\nAlthough everyone was inwardly frustrated, it was clear that nothing could be said at this time, especially since this was a free course offered by the Breeder Association, and the day’s gains had already been quite substantial.\nAs for Super-Rank Skills, aside from Su Ping, not many people were overly curious. It couldn’t be helped; the topic was just too far-fetched for an average Breeder. Even among those Advanced Level Evolutionary Body Pet Beasts, how many had mastered Super-Rank Skills? Never mind Commander Level and Monarch Level; what about Emperor Level?\nSuper-Rank Skills—that was the domain of Breeding Masters. For these individuals, becoming a Breeding Master was out of the question; they would be perfectly content and bring honor to their families if they could one day reach the level of an ordinary Advanced Level single-specialty Senior Breeder.\nHowever, Su Ping was quite satisfied for a simple reason: this class had awarded him 500 Experience Points.\nThat was already quite a pleasant surprise.\nSu Ping was even considering asking if the Breeder Association would offer more classes, so he could attend and audit them.\nWhile others departed promptly, Su Ping noticed Vice President Liu’s gaze and quickly followed him. After all, besides attending the class, he had another, even more important matter to address on this visit.\nVice President Liu’s office was also on the second floor, not too far from the classroom.\nUpon entering, an assistant immediately presented two cups of tea.\n\"Snow Peak Jade Dew. It’s a rare tea leaf produced from snowy mountain terrains. How do you find the taste?\" Vice President Liu offered.\nSu Ping didn’t stand on ceremony. He sampled it directly and then nodded. \"The taste is good, but it doesn’t compare to Spirit-Nurturing Ancient Tea.\"\nVice President Liu’s smile stiffened, and he stared at the young man who clearly didn’t appreciate the gesture.\nOops, I accidentally said what I really thought,\nSu Ping mused, giving an awkward smile as he met Vice President Liu’s gaze.\n\"Haha, the Spirit-Nurturing Ancient Tree is a Monarch Level Plant-based Pet Beast and is extremely scarce. Its tea leaves naturally aren’t comparable to ordinary items,\" Vice President Liu chuckled.\nHuh? It was Su Ping’s turn to be dumbfounded.\nThat thing is produced by a Monarch Level Pet Beast?\nUnfortunately, I drank it too quickly last time,\nhe thought.\nI was so focused on the effects of the Spirit-Nurturing Ancient Tea that I completely forgot what it actually tasted like.\nOf course, Su Ping’s visit this time was not for drinking tea. He hurriedly said, \"Old Liu, the Sun Crystal I mentioned to you over the phone...\"\nVice President Liu didn’t even bother with pleasantries. Without any visible action, a drawer in his coffee table opened, and a glass case appeared in his hands. Through the glass case, one could see a warm glow radiating from within, like a tiny light bulb. But if one looked carefully, they would see that it was a luminous stone the size of a baby’s fist.\n\"Old Liu, how much is this? You said over the phone that it’s free, what do you mean by that? I don’t understand, how can I obtain it?\" Su Ping asked.\nVice President Liu took a sip of tea and simply waved his hand. \"Just take it. Your Points are enough for the exchange.\"\n\"Points?\" Although Su Ping was astonished by Vice President Liu’s straightforwardness, he promptly sensed something was amiss.\nVice President Liu smiled. \"You kid, you really have no common sense about the Breeder Association. But that’s to be expected. Only by being so dedicated that you forget to eat and sleep can you achieve what others cannot at such a young age.\"\nWith that, he took out a remote and pressed a button. The next moment, a huge virtual blue light screen appeared in his office nearby.\n\"The Breeder Association isn’t running a charity. The main products sold by the Breeder Association are Pet Beasts and high-precision scientific instruments. However, some material resources aren’t circulated on the market via currency but through academic credits—that is, the Points I just mentioned.\"\nAcademic credits, Points...\nSu Ping mused.\nAlthough it sounds a bit like school, it’s actually a reliable system. If these resources could be bought with money, the Breeder Association probably wouldn’t have enough to sell.\nSu Ping now understood a fundamental truth about this world: there was never a shortage of wealthy people.\n\"So, how do you earn these Points?\" Su Ping asked.\nFacing Su Ping’s question, Vice President Liu laughed and said, \"As long as you achieve relevant research breakthroughs and can fully prove they are your own creations, you can earn Points. Of course, if you share the research in its entirety with the Breeder Association, you get more Points. And if its value is sufficient, the main Association will also provide unimaginable rewards and compensation.\n\"For example, just by verifying that your Forest Wolf’s Heart of Woods Cultivation method is indeed your achievement, you would immediately earn 1,000 Points. But if you share the entire Cultivation method for the Heart of Woods, you would directly receive over 10,000, or even tens of thousands, of Points, along with other requested rewards distributed by the main Association. These could be corresponding Advanced Level resources, rare Pet Beast cubs, or even some more special Skills, Pet Beast Cultivation methods, or Magic Potion formulas—all are possible.\n\"I won’t hide it from you: every quarter, the main Association of the Breeder Association distributes resources to the provincial Breeder branches. The quantity distributed is based on the Points generated by the local Breeder Association. So, for such research, even if it’s not shared with the Association, you’ll still earn Points as long as it’s created!\"\n\"I see.\"\n\"Alright, when you have time, browse our Breeder Association’s internal network to avoid such gaffes. But you, kid, you bought so many Forest Wolf cub Pet Beasts the other day, and now you’re asking for this Sun Crystal... it seems you really have some ideas about the Wanmu Wolf, hahaha, I’m waiting for your good news!\"\nOld Liu was extremely happy. As he had just said, if the Evolution solution for the Wanmu Wolf was developed, the Jianghai Province branch would also receive rewards from headquarters.\nSu Ping nodded.\nSo this is Dragon Nation’s talent reward system! Indeed, it’s precisely because of this talent reward system—spanning from the Beast Master Association to the Breeder Association and even various other associations—that Dragon Nation has been able to develop to its current state. Local officials definitely provide strong support for emerging talents, rather than suppressing them. Essentially, the success of these talents is also closely tied to their own interests.\nAnd Su Ping hadn’t expected that the Monarch Level resource, the Sun Crystal—which he originally thought would be the most difficult to acquire—would end up being the first and easiest to obtain. The first step in the Evolutionary Cultivation of the Wanmu Wolf proceeded smoothly, far beyond his imagination.",

      "content": "Chapter 70: Chapter 70 Qin Xiaoxue’s Gift! (One more)\nLeaving the Breeder Association, Su Ping regretted declining Old Liu’s polite offer to have his assistant send him home.\nThis old fellow was too chatty.\nClass had ended at four. After grabbing a bite to eat and indulging in a few drinks with Old Liu, it was already late into the night by the time Su Ping left. The subway and buses had all stopped running.\nHowever, Su Ping had enjoyed himself with Old Liu; after all, he had indeed gained a huge advantage from him. Although he was entitled to it according to the Breeder Association’s reward system, it wouldn’t have been so smooth and easy without Old Liu.\nThinking this, perhaps for some future research, he could involve Old Liu. It would be just like adding a supervisor’s name to papers in his previous life; unless the supervisor had a poor reputation, it would generally make processes much easier. And it would attract less attention.\nBut clearly, now wasn’t the time to think about these things.\nAfter carefully observing the Sun Crystal he had placed in the Beast Taming Space, Su Ping hailed a cab and headed home.\nNo sooner had he gotten into the car than his phone began to ring.\n\"Su Ping, are you done with Old Liu? Want to join us for another round?\"\nThe caller was none other than Sun Chaoju.\nThis guy hadn’t returned to Shuhua City but had stayed on in Linzhou City. Judging by the noise on the other end of the phone, there were quite a few people with him.\nTrue to form, as soon as Sun Chaoju finished speaking, a chorus of voices came through the phone.\n\"Su Ping, come on over! The bros will show you a good time! Let’s find some fun. And while we’re at it, let’s get a bit wild!\"\nA few dark lines appeared on Su Ping’s forehead. He recognized the voice as Breeder Mu Hang’s, though at this moment, it sounded somewhat slurred against the backdrop of the music.\nAnd with such a sleazy tone, there was no need to guess what kind of place they were in! Way too degenerate!\nSu Ping shook his head. \"No thanks, Sun Pei. You know Old Liu’s capacity for alcohol. I honestly can’t drink anymore. Some other day, I’ll treat you and the other senior Breeders.\"\n\"It’s a shame. We’ve got some young ladies here who’ve heard all about your reputation, Su Ping, and want to meet you.\"\nSun Chaoju’s voice was much clearer than Mu Hang’s; he was obviously not as intoxicated.\n\"Maybe in a few days. I actually have something I need your help with. I’d like you to introduce me to a powerful Paperman specialist, an Intermediate Undead Breeder in Linzhou City.\"\n\"Sure, just give me a call whenever you’re free!\"\nThe call ended. Only then did the piercing music and the loud yelling of those guys into the receiver finally stop.\nWay too degenerate! Way too extravagant!\nAs Intermediate Breeders of Dragon Nation, how could they sink into such low-level indulgence?\nIn his heart, Su Ping severely chastised such behavior. He couldn’t let himself learn bad habits from these unambitious slicksters! He was going to become a Breeding Master, a man at the pinnacle of Beast Tamers.\nWith that thought, just as Su Ping was about to close his eyes, he paused slightly. There was an unread message on his phone. It was a notification sent in the afternoon. He had been in class at the time and had his phone on silent, so naturally, he hadn’t seen it. He opened it now:\n[Your package has been delivered. As there was no response at your home, we have placed the package in the mailbox at your door. Please retrieve it as soon as possible. If you have any questions, you can call courier number: 5151154, phone: 152...]\nA package?\nAlthough he’d been constantly ordering things, this courier company and notification source weren’t the same as before. So, it wasn’t something he had purchased. Then there was only one possibility: was it the item Qin Xiaoxue said she’d mailed him a few days ago?\nThᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nSu Ping raised his eyebrows, a smile forming on his face. He then turned off his phone and closed his eyes.\nThe taxi fell silent. The taxi driver up front glanced strangely at the young man in the backseat through the rearview mirror.\nHe wasn’t very old, but there was a faint scent of alcohol on him. What was all that nonsense he was rambling about? And those drunks on the phone... what senior Breeders? Were those drunks the respected Breeders he mentioned? Give me a break! If they were Breeders, wouldn’t that make me the president of the Linzhou Beast Master Association? And him talking about introducing an Intermediate Breeder?\nThe taxi driver shook his head.\nYoung people these days, have a few drinks and they think they own all of Linzhou City.\nAt that thought, the driver glanced at the young man behind him, who seemed to have fallen asleep, and breathed a quiet sigh of relief.\nHe had been afraid the kid would vomit in his car.\nBefore long, the taxi arrived at the Lingxi River stop in the suburbs of Linzhou City. Su Ping paid the fare and got out of the car, his eyes clear again. Meditation helped him focus his attention and spirit. In fact, he hadn’t drunk much at all; he had spent most of the time discussing Pet Beast cultivation with Old Liu.\nWatching the taxi drive away, Su Ping suddenly thought of Qin Xiaoxue’s supercar. It was enhanced with a hovering effect, allowing it to fly at a certain speed—truly a top-tier vehicle.\nAnd it was damn cool!\nConsidering he might have to make more trips into Linzhou City in the future, should he also get a vehicle for commuting?\nUnfortunately, summoning large Pet Beasts wasn’t allowed on the streets of Linzhou City. Otherwise, Su Ping could have just ridden Old Sha, which would have been better than anything.\nFor now, he could only abide by such rules.\nHowever, the best vehicles were those made with Mechanical Cores, like that experimental instrument. The Mechanical Core is the most important component for awakening mechanical-type Pet Beasts and is extremely valuable; a large part of that instrument’s cost was probably for its Mechanical Core. Such vehicles have many advantages, primarily convenient range and autonomous operation. Of course, while there are many benefits, there is one major drawback: they’re damn expensive.\nShaking his head, Su Ping dismissed these distracting thoughts.\nAlthough he was making a good amount of money now, it still had to be spent wisely. Wasting it on such extravagances wasn’t in his nature.\nThe late-night breeze revitalized Su Ping’s spirits considerably. He quickly ran to the somewhat retro-looking mailbox. Sure enough, inside was a small, sealed box. The return address was from the Magic Capital.\nIt was indeed Qin Xiaoxue’s package.\nTaking out the box, he noted it had some weight to it.\nIt was actually quite heavy.\nSu Ping didn’t act rashly. He hurried back into his house with the box and solemnly placed it on the table. Then, taking a deep breath, he finally opened it. Inside, he found another, smaller box. Upon opening that one, he found yet an even smaller box.\nSu Ping was speechless.\nWas Miss Qin this bored? Was she just playing a prank on him?\nShaking his head, Su Ping continued to open the boxes. Finally, in the last box, which was only about the size of a fist, he saw something different. It was a small, pebble-like object, and strangely, a three-leaf clover was growing on top of it.\nWhat is this?\nSu Ping raised an eyebrow. Fortunately, there was an explanatory card beside it. He picked it up and read it, his pupils suddenly contracting.",

      "content": "Chapter 71: Chapter 71: The Stone of Creation, Space Characteristics. (Second Update)\n「Magic Capital.」\nHere lies one of the centers of the Dragon Nation. It is also one of the most prosperous cities. Even though Linzhou is quite decent, it still falls far short when compared to the Magic Capital. Here, there is the largest Pet Beast trading market in the Dragon Nation, offering all sorts of resources and Pet Beasts. Even some unique Pet Beasts from other countries can be seen here. Even at this hour, the Magic Capital remains as bright as ever, like an eternal city that never sleeps.\nAnd in an extremely vast area within this city, there resides the Magic Capital Advanced Beast-Taming Academy. It is also one of the top advanced Beast Tamer institutions within the Dragon Nation. It is the cradle of many battle-profession Beast Tamers. Countless top figures in the Dragon Nation have graduated from this academy.\nAt this moment, within an Advanced Level dormitory of the Magic Capital Academy, three people in the Meditation Room had yet to emerge from their state of meditation, even though it was normally time to rest. In the Magic Capital Academy, competition was omnipresent. Only by constantly striving forward could one hope to lead the race.\nHowever, in this tranquil moment of meditation, a ringtone suddenly sounded. All three frowned almost simultaneously and opened their eyes. But when the other two saw the source of the ringing, they said nothing more. It was Miss Qin’s phone. Even within the Magic Capital Academy, as her roommates, no one dared to comment. Moreover, they knew Qin Xiaoxue took her cultivation very seriously. Normally, anyone daring to call at this hour either had something important or was a close relative; otherwise, the caller was sure to be in for a rough time.\nSure enough, under the watchful eyes of the other two, Qin Xiaoxue’s delicate brows furrowed, a hint of impatience and irritation flashing in her eyes.\nDon’t they know that her meditation time, from seven to twelve at night, is sacrosanct?\nShe impatiently took out her phone. Qin Xiaoxue then paused, slightly stunned. Before the watchful eyes of her two classmates, the irritation and impatience visibly vanished, replaced by a faint smile they had never seen on her before. The speed of this transformation was astounding; the two girls, Qin Xiaoxue’s classmates for two years, had never witnessed anything like it.\nHowever, what happened next was even more incredible to them.\nHolding the phone, Qin Xiaoxue neither answered it immediately nor hastily hung up. Instead, she spoke to the other two, \"Xiao Xiao, Xiao Lu, I’m going to take a call. You two continue. Sorry for the disturbance, my apologies!\"\nWith that, Qin Xiaoxue hurriedly trotted out of the Meditation Room, not even bothering to close the door, and eagerly answered the call, \"Hello, Su Ping...\"\nIn the Meditation Room, the two girls exchanged glances, both noticing the peculiar expression in each other’s eyes.\nWhat in the world?\nMiss Qin didn’t impatiently hang up or immediately block the caller? She even interrupted her own meditation for it?\nThis was truly unprecedented.\nAnd most importantly, that name she mentioned just before leaving the room.\nSu Ping?\nThey had never heard of him.\nMiss Qin knows someone like that?!\nThere’s definitely something fishy going on! There must be a story here!\nThe two girls no longer had any inclination to continue meditating. Another few dozen minutes of meditation wouldn’t lead to a breakthrough anyway. After all, gossiping and showboating are humanity’s fourth basic instinct. So, the two girls exchanged a glance and, without a second thought, rose to their feet in unison, approaching the door to eavesdrop.\nUnfortunately, by the time Qin Xiaoxue answered the call, she had already stepped out of the dormitory.Thɪs NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\n\"You received that thing, huh? Haha, did it take you a long time to open? Did you think I was messing with you, and then, suddenly, when you got to the end, you found a little surprise?\"\nQin Xiaoxue’s triumphant voice on the other end of the line left Su Ping somewhat exasperated—not because of Miss Qin’s trivial prank, but because of the item itself:\n\"Miss Qin, this item is too precious. I really can’t accept it.\"\n\"Just call me Xiao Xue, or by my first name. Besides, what’s so precious about it? This thing is perfectly suited for your Pet Beast Home Talent. I remembered I had it and just brought it over for you. It was just lying around gathering dust anyway.\" Qin Xiaoxue then continued earnestly, \"The Pet Beast Home primarily concerns the cultivation of a Beast Tamer’s Beast Taming Space. That item doesn’t significantly enhance combat power; its main application is for Beast Tamers. If you plan to house many Pet Beasts in your Beast Taming Space in the future, its proper management is a crucial aspect of your development.\"\nBefore Su Ping could speak again, Qin Xiaoxue hurriedly continued, \"Do you think your family’s Secret Realm was just left behind by chance? A Beast Tamer’s Beast Taming Space is their foundation and primary resource generator. The more effective the Beast Taming Space, the wealthier the Beast Tamer becomes—as they say, a rising tide lifts all boats. This is also immensely beneficial for your future development. That Stone of Creation can not only endow a Beast Tamer’s Beast Taming Space with the ’ecological cycle’ Trait, but it can also continuously absorb spiritual energy, thereby expanding your Beast Taming Space. It’s very suitable for you.\"\nSu Ping smiled wryly.\nHow could he not know how suitable it was? When he saw this thing’s effects, his eyes nearly popped out of their sockets.\nBut this item was truly too valuable.\n\"Alright, alright, I still need to meditate, so I’m hanging up now. If there’s anything else, we can talk about it during the day.\"\nThe line went dead.\nSu Ping let out a helpless sigh.\nAlthough his father’s teachings still seemed to echo in his ears, Su Ping had truly never considered repaying such a favor by dedicating his life to her.\nIndeed, is the hidden meaning of a steel wool ball really ’endurance brings wealth’?\nA Beast Tamer’s primary Abilities manifest mainly in two ways. Firstly, each time they advance a Level, they can contract an additional Pet Beast. Secondly, and crucially, there is the Beast Taming Space. As a core Ability of Beast Tamers, each time they advance to a new Realm, their Beast Taming Space also changes, evolving with each advancement. Besides its area expanding, certain corresponding Trait effects will also emerge. These are, in essence, enhancements to the Beast Taming Space.\nFor example, some common Traits include:\n[Volcano: A Fire Element recovery-type Trait. The Fire Element spiritual energy within the Beast Taming Space becomes more abundant, and the recovery rate for Fire Element Pet Beasts is accelerated...]\n[Mine: A Gold and Earth resource-type Trait. There is a chance for ore veins of corresponding Levels to condense within the Beast Taming Space...]\nThe variety of such effects is vast. Most of the time, the development of these Traits depends on the Beast Tamer’s chosen Pet Beasts, combined with their Talent and an element of randomness. However, certain treasures can, through external influence, alter the Traits that emerge within a Beast Taming Space. Some can even allow Beast Tamers to awaken additional Trait effects.\nAnd the stone before him now was precisely such a treasure.\nSu Ping looked helplessly at the card describing this item. It clearly stated:\n[Stone of Creation: A special Emperor Level Peak resource. Can be integrated into a Beast Tamer’s Beast Taming Space. After the Beast Tamer advances a Great Realm, the Beast Taming Space will gain the ’ecological cycle’ Trait. Furthermore, it will slowly expand as it Takes Root within the Beast Taming Space and, to a certain extent, increase the Beast Tamer’s meditation speed.]",

      "content": "Chapter 72: Chapter 72 Ordinary Ninth Rank, Evolutionary Cultivation Begins! (Three More)\nSu Ping knew he owed a big favor and could only think of repaying it later with some special Cultivation method.\nAlthough he was somewhat emotional, Su Ping was not the type to be excessively sentimental or affected.\nQin Xiaoxue already mailed it over,\nSu Ping thought.\nHow could I possibly be so difficult as to send it back? Send it back? With her personality, would she even accept it? Now that I’ve taken it, I’ll just have to find ways to reciprocate in the future.\nOf course, this was also because Su Ping had confidence in himself. Otherwise, if he lacked the ability, forcibly accepting such a gift might indeed require a commitment of a more... personal nature.\nCurrently, Su Ping was only of an Ordinary Tier.\nHe could not even enter his own Beast Taming Space, only able to use Psychic Perception and control.\nThe Creation Divine Stone, no larger than a pebble and with a three-leaf clover growing on it, slowly disappeared from sight and then merged into Su Ping’s Beast Taming Space.\nThe dreary, silent Beast Taming Space, a mere concept of existence, slowly encompassed it.\nA streak of vibrant life burst forth from it, prompting Su Ping to unconsciously let out a soft breath.\nAn icy sensation spread, seeming to emanate from the deepest part of his soul.\nHis mind felt a wave of clarity. A cool stream spread from the depths of his consciousness throughout his body, involuntarily guiding him into a state of meditation.\nThe Spiritual Power in the Beast Taming Space quickly gathered towards it.\nIn an instant, Su Ping broke through the slight Spirit Barrier—one not even considered a bottleneck—and his own Realm advanced from Ordinary Eighth Rank to Ordinary Ninth Rank.\nThis is Emperor Level Peak material!\nMoreover, it was a special material effective for human Beast Tamers, its value beyond the comparison of ordinary items.\nEven if it didn’t directly increase a Beast Tamer’s Spiritual Realm, its contribution to Realm advancement was entirely natural and smooth.\nAnd the Beast Taming Space was the foundation of a Beast Tamer.\nMany Advanced Level resources not originating from Pet Beasts were actually discovered within the Beast Taming Spaces of High-Level Beastmasters.\nTherefore, managing the Beast Taming Space is the most important task for a Beast Tamer, second only to their Pet Beasts.\nSu Ping occasionally wondered what his first Space Characteristics would be once he broke through to the Elite Tier and his Beast Taming Space began to show its effects. He also pondered his future plans for the Beast Taming Space.\nBut he never dreamed that he would start with such an amazing stroke of luck.\nHe focused on the sensation for a moment. Perhaps the slight intoxication had long since faded, or perhaps it was due to the day’s events, but Su Ping felt no desire to sleep.\nHe first went to check on the Paperman. Seeing the little fellow was still diligently practicing, Su Ping decided not to disturb it further.\nInstead, he went to the edge of the forest. Sure enough, nothing in the vast woods could escape Old Sha’s perception.\nThe moment he appeared, Old Sha left the training wolf pack and quickly approached Su Ping:\n\"AWOO! (You’re back!)\"\nSu Ping rubbed Old Sha’s head. The old wolf showed a contented expression, and Su Ping finally said,\n\"Old Sha, are you ready for Evolution?\"\nEvolution?\nEven without Mind Sensing, Old Sha understood human language quite well.\nAt first, it looked at Su Ping perplexedly. Then its eyes, already eerily green in the night, suddenly became incredibly bright.\nAs an old wolf who’s lived for so many years and seen so much, how could I not know what this means? How could I not understand what Evolution represents? Stronger Abilities, a brighter future, and an extended lifespan.\nThis youngster in front of me... I watched him grow up from when he was tiny. Back then, he was just a child in split pants. But he’s also my most important family. My new little master, whom I must continue to silently care for.\nMany years ago, I also thought about Evolution and even attempted it. However, my early opportunities led to an improvement in my Sunlight Absorption Skill, even allowing me to break through the limit of my Race. Yet, this very breakthrough might have, under certain circumstances, become a shackle. After several attempts, spending a huge amount of Money and resources, all ended in failure. Eventually, even I gave up.\nMy greatest wish then was to see this boy grow up and restore the Heart of Woods to its former glory. Now, I’ve seen it. Essentially, I have no regrets. I was just waiting for the end, for my vitality to completely fade and to pass away. But I never imagined that today, at this very moment, this little fellow I watched grow up would say such things to me.\nIn that instant, the aged wolf seemed to shed twenty years, returning to the prime of its youth from decades past.\nIt suddenly straightened its tall body. At this moment, the spirited Old Sha was even slightly taller than the upright Su Ping.\nTowards the bright moonlight in the sky, Old Sha raised its head and howled.\nIn that howl, it was as if an old soldier on the verge of death was boldly declaring to a young general, \"Though I am aged, my arrows are still sharp!\"\nMy little master hasn’t given up on me, so why should I give up on myself? That Magic Potion from the Heart of Woods... it made me completely unable to see through my little master. And now, in these final moments, I’m willing to believe in Su Ping!\nSu Ping also laughed heartily and patted Old Sha’s back. \"Good! Starting tomorrow morning, Old Sha, prepare to undergo my Evolution Cultivation!\"\n\"AOOUU!\"\nBeneath the bright moonlight, the ear-piercing Wolf Howl echoed far and wide...\n「And right outside the gates of Heart of Woods.」\nA small flying vehicle instantly flew over from the road above.\nIt passed by the gates of Heart of Woods and returned to Yuntian Resort.\nThis vehicle had no intention of stopping but went straight to the highest level of the central building, by the window outside.\nThen, in a transformation reminiscent of Iron Man, the flying vehicle retracted into a watch, revealing the figure within.\nThis figure was none other than Dong Muyun, dressed only in underwear.\nThis kind of personal flying vehicle wasn’t as good as those combat armors developed through Mechanical Pet Beast Cultivation.\nDong Muyun didn’t mind. She casually walked into the bathroom for a shower, then put on pajamas, took a glass of red wine, and pressed a button.\nIt wasn’t long before a figure walked in. \"Chairman.\"\n\"How has that little fellow next door been while I was away from Linzhou?\"\n\"Reporting to the Chairman, Su Ping hasn’t visited again. His business seems to be thriving. The weekly Cultivation fees are bringing in four to five million.\"\nDong Muyun exhaled, a hint of urgency in her eyes. \"I understand. Tomorrow, you come with me to find that little fellow. Then, we’ll do this...\"\n\"This... Yes.\"\nI must meet this kid,\nDong Muyun thought.",

      "content": "Chapter 73: Chapter 73: The First Stage, the Arrival of Dong Muyun!\nOld Sha looked at Su Ping, who was being meticulous, with a sense of deep resentment.\nAlthough it was absolutely certain in its heart and believed in Su Ping, it had to admit that such a method of evolutionary cultivation still made it feel extremely uncomfortable.\nThe taste in its mouth was like chewing wax...\nNo, it’s even worse than chewing wax,\nOld Sha wished it could simply spit it out, give up on evolving, and then go indulge in several huge buckets of meat and tree fruit every day in the last phase of its wolf life.\nHowever, seeing the cold and serious look in Su Ping’s eyes, Old Sha had no choice but to continue ’tasting.’\nThe earthy scent of tree bark, tree trunks, tree branches, and tree roots made it unbearably uncomfortable.\nYet, it had no option but to follow Su Ping’s instructions closely, tasting the flavors within, feeling the texture and fibrous structures of these trees.\nAt the same time, it buried its legs into the ground, using Sunlight Absorption while listlessly eating the seemingly endless and unsatisfying tree branches, tree trunks, and tree bark.\nSu Ping watched Old Sha’s movements while quickly making notes on paper. He was observing the changes in Old Sha on the first day of its evolutionary cultivation, noting some of the conditions that arose. He also noticed some things in the evolutionary cultivation process that were slightly different from normal.\nThe most direct point was that Old Sha currently possessed the Heart of Woods skill. The Heart of Woods skill allowed a Forest Wolf to quickly absorb the power of vegetation to replenish itself. This was the first thing Su Ping needed to observe at this moment.\nHe found that when Old Sha consumed the trees, it didn’t exhibit the vomiting reflex that Sun Chaoju’s records described in Forest Wolves after excessive wood consumption—a reflex that typically prolonged this first phase. Moreover, not all Forest Wolves could successfully gain insight into Photosynthesis during this phase.\nSu Ping was now genuinely worried that if the Heart of Woods skill caused any fluctuations or unexpected changes in the evolution, it would be problematic.\nHowever, this wasn’t mentioned in the precautions of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, so there shouldn’t be too significant an impact, right?\nThinking of this, Su Ping breathed a slight sigh of relief, and a glint of anticipation appeared in his eyes.\nAs stated in the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, the higher the levels of Sunlight Absorption and Photosynthesis were during the evolution of the Wanmu Wolf, the higher the potential of the evolved Wanmu Wolf would be. Because of Old Sha’s past experiences and serendipitous encounters, its Sunlight Absorption had reached the Perfection Level. For a Wanmu Wolf, a Perfection Level Sunlight Absorption was equivalent to Perfection Level Photosynthesis.\nAnd as for the level beyond Perfection, the so-called Divine Transformation Level?\nSu Ping didn’t dwell on it. That level wasn’t something a Pet Beast could achieve through mere effort. In fact, due to limitations in talent and aptitude, even reaching the Perfection Level through training was incredibly difficult, let alone Divine Transformation. Divine Perfection was a skill’s peak moment of brilliance, a unique understanding and blessing completely beyond the skill itself—something that could only be achieved through such a breakthrough. If one aimed for the Divine Transformation Level of Sunlight Absorption, then Su Ping would say that all Forest Wolves could just give up and go to sleep.\nTherefore, the Perfection Level was already the highest evolutionary limit.The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nSo, what would its species’ upper limit be for a Perfection Level Wanmu Wolf after completing its evolution? Peak Command? Monarch Peak? Or even Emperor Level?\nSu Ping shook his head.\nMonarch Level is possible, but reaching Emperor Level... that’s thinking too much.\nAbove Monarch Level, including Monarch Level itself, each level represented a massive threshold. Before Qin Xiaoxue’s Crown Wolf Emperor, Su Ping had never heard of a Forest Wolf evolutionary body reaching Monarch Advanced. Even if the Wanmu Wolf was truly as mystical as described in the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, a top-tier evolutionary body choice for a Forest Wolf, its upper limits were still clearly defined.\nUnless, beyond the Wanmu Wolf, there’s an even further evolutionary body that can be developed and researched?!\nHowever, Su Ping quickly shook his head. One shouldn’t try to run before learning to walk. It was best not to dwell on such lofty and distant dreams.\nThe pen scribbled rapidly across the pages of his journal. Just as Su Ping was about to continue issuing orders to Old Sha, to see if there were any other issues that needed attention during the Wanmu Wolf’s evolution stage, the doorbell rang.\nSu Ping frowned but felt somewhat helpless. After all, the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base needed to be managed. Even though he had already shortened customer reception to the mornings, someone would come by almost every day. Ultimately, it was because Su Ping hadn’t bothered to hire anyone.\nThis is really affecting me. It seems I really need to hire some staff. Never mind other things, just handling visitors is a hassle.\nRubbing his temples, Su Ping put down his notes, said a quick word to Old Sha, and then headed to the front door.\nHowever, upon opening the door, the two people he saw made Su Ping pause. Instinctively, he felt that these two were definitely not customers coming for Pet Beast cultivation; they didn’t look the part. One was a beautiful woman with an understated appearance yet an air of superiority, and the other, a man who looked like a typical underling, was clearly a lackey.\nMoreover, the most important thing was that this woman seemed familiar to him, as if he had seen her somewhere before. And indeed, that was the case, for as soon as the door opened, the man, who appeared to be in his thirties, haughtily asked, \"You are Su Ping? I am the new manager of the Yuntian Resort, and this is our chairman. We would like to discuss acquiring this piece of land your family owns.\"\nSu Ping’s brow instinctively furrowed. But he finally recognized who had come—it was Dong Muyun, the Chairman of the Tianyun Group, the very person he had been preparing to meet.\n\"Come in.\"\nIn the reception room, the new manager hurried over, meticulously wiped the sofa with his handkerchief, and then obsequiously said to Dong Muyun, \"Chairman, please, take a seat.\"\nSu Ping’s frown deepened as he looked at the man with growing disfavor.\nIt was hard to imagine! Uncle Guan, who had worked for many years at the Yuntian Resort, had been squeezed out by such a person?\nFor the first time, Su Ping looked at Dong Muyun with skepticism. This legendary \"Queen Dong\" didn’t seem all that astute, did she?\nSo, after taking a seat, Su Ping directly asked the question he was genuinely most concerned about, \"This is the new manager of the Yuntian Resort? Then, may I ask, where has the previous manager, Manager Guan, gone?\"\nDong Muyun still did not speak; it was the new manager beside her who answered, \"Oh, you mean Lao Guan? He was ineffective in his work, and his implementation of the chairman’s orders was extremely superficial, so his position was changed. He was dispatched to Crescent Island to be a foreman. Oh right, you probably don’t know what Crescent Island is, do you? It’s on West Dragon Lake, at the end of Lingxi River, not far from our Linzhou. Tsk tsk, he hardly gets to come back more than a few times a year.\"\nHe was smug, the very image of a petty man gloating in his triumph.\nThis made Su Ping’s frown deepen even more. The disgust in his eyes was not concealed in the least.",

      "content": "Chapter 74: Chapter 74 Dong Muyun’s Skit Performance!\nSu Ping had initially been quite curious about Dong Muyun of the Tianyun Group, a woman influential enough to be dubbed ’Queen Dong.’ Now, however, he had absolutely no intention of interacting with her.\nThus, meeting their gazes, Su Ping stated coldly, \"I’ve said it before: our family’s land deed will not be sold. Not only will it not be sold, but we also won’t renew the lease when it expires next year. I have other matters to attend to. If you two don’t have anything else, I won’t see you out.\"\nDong Muyun frowned. The man beside her, the resort’s new manager, fixed Su Ping with an icy gaze. \"Su Ping, do you know who we are? Do you know who our Chairman is? Our Chairman could crush you as easily as an ant!\"\nA sneer touched Su Ping’s lips as anger welled within him. He was about to offer a sarcastic retort but caught himself.\nHe suddenly felt something was amiss.\nThis man before him, the new manager of the Yuntian Resort, seemed a bit too clownish.\nIt would be forgivable if it were someone like Zhou Shuchen, who had just graduated. Such a person would likely have a simplistic mindset and little social experience, perhaps acting a bit cocky after awakening a talent, especially given a prior family-related inferiority complex.\nBut what about this man?\nHe looked to be around thirty—not old, but certainly not young anymore—and he was part of the Tianyun Group’s corporate structure.\nIf he truly were such a mindless, power-abusing underling, wouldn’t that be a bit out of character?\nOf course, some people truly were like that, overconfident in their status, but Dong Muyun was right there!\nCould he afford to be so foolish? With the true boss of Tianyun Group present, would Dong Muyun approve of his attitude? Or was this an act, deliberately performed for her?\nWhat was the point? It seemed illogical, especially since Su Ping had maintained a vague stance previously and hadn’t offended them, right?\nFaintly, a possibility bloomed in Su Ping’s mind.\nThis meant the manager’s current despicable behavior was precisely what Dong Muyun had instructed him to do.\nA glint of realization shone in Su Ping’s eyes.\nDid this woman really think he was a child?\nDid she think that by provoking his emotions, she could make him do something impulsive?\nThis thought flashed through his mind. As Su Ping sneered at the two before him, the man, predictably, continued his pompous speech, \"I’m telling you, our Chairman is the Chairman of the Tianyun Group in Jianghai Province! Her net worth is thousands, even tens of thousands of times greater than your meager cultivation field!\"\nSu Ping remained silent, simply watching the two of them perform.\nDong Muyun frowned slightly and, as the presumed good cop, finally spoke, \"Manager Qian...\"\nPredictably, the so-called Manager Qian, who had just been arrogant and domineering, instantly deflated. He adopted a servile demeanor, even more fawning than the Forest Wolves begging for tree fruit.\nSeeing Su Ping’s gaze slowly shift to her, Dong Muyun smiled faintly, a smile she considered—and which indeed was—irresistibly charming, as she said, \"Su Ping, Tianyun Group is not a band of robbers, nor are we pirates. Besides, your talent is exceptional. I hold you in high regard and genuinely appreciate your abilities.\n\"Let’s do this: for the land we’re currently leasing, plus your family’s current plot, I can offer double the price Manager Guan previously proposed. I’ll also give you two options.\n\"First, if you wish to continue operating a cultivation base, Tianyun Group has an undeveloped plot of land on Chonghua Road, within Linzhou City’s Third Ring. We can transfer this land to you directly, and we’ll also cover the costs to rebuild it to your complete satisfaction.\n\"Second, if you no longer wish to waste your time on this small plot of land, I can authorize your immediate entry into Tianyun Group’s Cultivation Department. You would start as Deputy Director. Beyond your personal commissions, never mind the monthly salary; you would also have priority access to some of Tianyun Group’s internal resources!\"\nDong Muyun’s smiling eyes radiated absolute confidence; she believed Su Ping had no reason to refuse her offer.\nIndeed, if he hadn’t known about the Secret Realm beforehand, such a generous offer would have made him seriously consider it.\nIt was so generous that Manager Qian, standing beside her, couldn’t help but interject, \"Chairman, we only want to sketch out a large-scale, comprehensive Pet Beast ecological village here. There’s no need to spend so much! Entrust this to me. I’m certain I’ll do a far better job than that good-for-nothing Guan Qianshan. I guarantee your satisfaction!\"\nAs he spoke, he even seemed to exude a cold, threatening intent, the unspoken implication clear.\nUnder such circumstances, if Su Ping had really been a seventeen or eighteen-year-old graduate, he might actually have been intimidated.\nThe conditions Dong Muyun proposed were indeed excellent, and the accompanying threat was certainly his Achilles’ heel.\nHowever, I am now an Intermediate Level Breeder registered with the Breeder Association. How could they manipulate me so easily?\nDo they really think I’m some naive kid who doesn’t know how to leverage his position?\nBesides, Dong Muyun’s conditions sounded good, seemingly covering all angles.\nBut who can’t make empty promises?\nWhat if they developed the Secret Realm and then just tossed it aside, leaving me with nothing? That’s entirely possible.\nI wouldn’t expect to see a single cent.\nSu Ping had no faith in the promises of these capitalist entrepreneurs; to him, they were the biggest joke in the world.\nHowever, he didn’t rush to expose them. Instead, he found their little performance rather amusing.Googlᴇ search\nHe had even figured out the true meaning behind their act.\nThey had reached this point: one side threatening, the other enticing, yet facing only his disdain.\nHow could a young man his age endure such a thing?\nSu Ping then said, his eyes flashing with ’anger,’ \"Are you saying if I agree, you can make this guy get lost? Even disappear from the face of the earth?\"\nSu Ping pointed at Manager Qian, who had suddenly turned ’deathly pale.’\nThis guy’s acting is truly superb. If my mental fortitude weren’t beyond that of my peers, I might have actually been fooled.\n\"Hmph, you think our Chairman...\"\n\"Manager Qian, you’re fired.\"\n\"Chairman, no! I’d toil like an ox and horse for you and Tianyun Group! This brat...\"\nManager Qian immediately began to wail. A smile touched Dong Muyun’s lips.\nYoung people, after all,\nshe thought.\nSo quick to anger. A few taunts and insults, and they can’t take it.\nBut isn’t this perfect?\nDong Muyun ignored Manager Qian’s performance—which she found quite satisfactory—and slowly turned to Su Ping, a smile playing on her lips as she said, \"Satisfied now? Send me your account number. I’ll transfer half the deposit first, and then we can sign...\"\nSu Ping also smiled, his earlier anger and coldness vanishing completely. His smile, remarkably similar to Dong Muyun’s, was accompanied by a nod and a chuckle as he said, \"Indeed, I’m satisfied. A little skit personally performed by the Chairman of Tianyun Group... ordinary people certainly don’t get to see that. How could I not be satisfied?\"\nAt these words, both Dong Muyun and Manager Qian—who was still pale with despair and begging for mercy—froze.\nSu Ping ignored their changed expressions and continued in a low voice, \"It’s just a shame. If a mere skit like this could secure the development rights to a wild Secret Realm, Tianyun Group would have become the top corporation in Dragon Nation, perhaps even the world, long ago, wouldn’t it?\"\nHearing this, Dong Muyun’s expression finally, truly changed.\nHow does this kid know?",

      "content": "Chapter 75: Chapter 75: The Furious Dong Muyun, Uncle Guan’s Whereabouts!\nThe atmosphere suddenly turned eerily silent.\nManager Qian’s face instantly flushed red with embarrassment, and this time, he said no more.\nAs for Dong Muyun, after a brief moment of astonishment, her eyes filled with undisguised gloom.\nAt the same time, a storm of shock raged within her.\nHow is this possible? How could this kid know? He was just a recent graduate. Even if his family possessed some Advanced Level Pet Beasts and had sensed the spatial fluctuations, it wasn’t something ordinary people would typically be aware of. After all, the concept of a Secret Realm wasn’t something Beast Tamers would ordinarily consider.\nWith this in mind, Dong Muyun’s eyes glinted with an even colder chill, though this chill was not directed at the youngster before her.\nIt’s all because I wasted too much time previously; the family side took up too much of my energy, and I could only leave this matter to those incompetents.\nHowever, Dong Muyun was no ordinary individual. She almost instantly regained her usual demeanor, her eyes showing complete indifference as she looked at Su Ping.\n\"What exactly do you want?\"\nHer voice finally revealed her usual high-and-mighty attitude, as if granting whatever was desired was within her power to bestow.\nYet she completely overlooked a key point. According to Dragon Nation’s laws, unless it’s in the wilderness, the owner of the land title where a Secret Realm appears holds the authority to manage it.\nIt was as if this unknown Secret Realm, which had appeared on *his* property, was already in the bag for her and the Tianyun Group!\nSu Ping disliked this tone and the look in her eyes.\nSince the conversation was already out in the open, Su Ping had nothing to hide. He crossed his legs and said carelessly, \"I’m not lacking anything. However, my family could use a stepmother, and the cultivation base here needs someone to scoop poop for Forest Wolf. What do you think, Miss Dong?\"\nDong Muyun’s face showed no anger, but it became even colder at that moment.\nHer icy eyes, which seemed capable of freezing blood, took a deep look at Su Ping—a youngster so arrogant at such a young age. She then stood up, leading Manager Qian. He was as silent as a cicada in winter, and when his eyes occasionally met Su Ping’s, they flashed with admiration.\nGood heavens, this kid was something else! He’d joined the Tianyun Group right after graduation and worked diligently for over a decade, but this was the first time he’d ever seen such a formidable person. Making their Chairman a stepmother? Or having her scoop poop for Forest Wolf? Truth be told, the thought of that scenario actually stirred some anticipation in him. But obviously, right now, he could only meekly follow Dong Muyun out and hope he wouldn’t end up as collateral damage.\nThe door closed.\nOnly then did Su Ping let out a long sigh of relief.\nIn the end, he was still nervous.\nDong Muyun’s status and strength were evident; she was, at the very least, a Monarch Level Beast Tamer.\nPreviously, with the Tianyun Group’s power and influence, crushing him would have been simple. Fortunately, he was now an Intermediate Breeder with the Breeder Association.\nWith such a status, and being so young, even the Tianyun Group wouldn’t dare make a move against him easily.\nThis was one of Su Ping’s safeguards. He believed Dong Muyun was undoubtedly aware of his unconcealed identity.\nIt could be said that if it weren’t for this status, Su Ping would have directly informed the Qintian Monitor about the appearance of the Secret Realm.\nAfter all, an official organization was more reliable than those capitalists.\nSu Ping also implicitly trusted Qin Xiaoxue’s earlier advice: if *he* wasn’t confident about personally developing it, handing it over to the Qintian Monitor would be more reliable.\nHowever, now that he had the Paperman, Su Ping still wanted to try himself.\nAfter all, human desire is insatiable, like a snake trying to swallow an elephant. Faced with such a potential treasure mountain, Su Ping wouldn’t be content without seeing it for himself.\nTaking a deep breath, Su Ping didn’t rush to continue watching Old Sha gnawing on the tree.\nHe trusted Old Sha’s self-discipline, and besides, at this initial stage, any minor hiccups wouldn’t be a big deal.\nAt worst, they’d be delayed by a few days in entering the third phase, which wasn’t significant.\nHowever, Su Ping now really didn’t want to be affected by all this chaos again.\nHe definitely needed to find someone to help.\nNot for training or interacting with Pet Beasts, but someone to concentrate fully on welcoming guests and dealing with various minor tasks—the role of a steward.\nAnd soon enough, Su Ping thought of someone:\nGuan Qianshan!\nPreviously, Su Ping had only seen Lao Guan leave; he was too busy at the time and hadn’t caught up after a mere glance.\nBut now he knew: Lao Guan had been exiled because of Su Ping’s own affairs.\nAlthough it was highly likely that Dong Muyun had deliberately orchestrated this situation, using it as an indirect means to persuade Su Ping to agree to the sale of the deed.\nSmall figures often become cannon fodder in various disputes.\nMany times, Su Ping was unable to reach out or help, but this time was clearly different.\nTo be fair, he could say with a clear conscience that Lao Guan had treated him well. Lao Guan had only attempted to purchase his family’s land deed on Dong Muyun’s orders because he had no other choice.\nSu Ping had no reason to harbor any suspicions about Manager Guan because of this.\nMoreover, his own place genuinely lacked someone to manage guest reception. Lao Guan had worked at Yun Tian for many years and had a good relationship with both Su Ping and his father.\nHaving someone relatively familiar like him to help look after things would indeed lighten Su Ping’s load substantially.\nBesides, what he’d said to Dong Muyun earlier wasn’t just hot air.\nOnce next year’s lease was up, Su Ping would no longer lease to the Tianyun Group.\nBy then, regardless of whether the Tianyun Group left the buildings at Yuntian Resort standing or demolished them all, Su Ping would further expand on the foundation of his own cultivation base.\nHe aimed to create a complete, mature cultivation base industry chain.\nCurrently, the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base didn’t even have a place for guests to stay and try out battles, let alone the numerous high-end complementary facilities and infrastructure that many other cultivation bases boasted.\nMoreover, Su Ping had considered establishing breeding areas for other types of Pet Beasts; after all, it wasn’t feasible for all of them to be crammed into the same forest with the Forest Wolves.\nWhen he had time, Su Ping even wanted to visit Shuhua City to see what Sun Chaoju’s Pet Beast Breeding Base was like, and then\nto fleece some wool... no, to learn from their experience.\nWhen that time came, more staff would be needed, and Su Ping couldn’t possibly manage everything himself.\nAs for his own father, that was even less likely.\nLao Guan’s many years as a manager at Yun Tian had endowed him with invaluable experience and insight.\nWith these thoughts in mind, Su Ping picked up his phone, searched for a while, and finally found the exiled Manager Guan in his contacts list.\nHe then took the initiative to make the call.",

      "content": "Chapter 76: Chapter 76: Recruiting Help: The Careless Guan Qianshan!\nCrescent Island is in a rather special location.\nThe Lingxi River is a relatively wide river that runs through the entire Jianghai Province before rushing into the sea.\nHowever, this river doesn’t just directly enter the Eastern Sea. Instead, at the edge of the Eastern Sea, in the coastal region of Jianghai Province, it forms a semicircular lake. This immense lake, like an inland sea for Jianghai Province, then flows into the Eastern Sea.\nThis lake is West Dragon Lake.\nWest Dragon Lake is vast, especially since it borders the Eastern Sea. This is one of the reasons why the aquatic Pet Beasts of Linzhou and Jianghai Province are so abundant.\nMoreover, countless small islands dot this huge lake, and with the rich aquatic Pet Beast resources, many places are ripe for development.\nWithout a doubt, Crescent Island is one of them.\nThe island, shaped like a crescent moon, floats on the vast lake. At its very center, a figure stood.\nHe sighed, looking at the workers busy with construction in the distance.\nIt was none other than Guan Qianshan, who had already been on this island for half a month.\nCompared to Yun Tian, the difference here was more than just heaven and earth. On Crescent Island, food, drink, and general living conditions were all inconvenient. Although he was only separated from his family by West Dragon Lake and a small stretch of the Lingxi River, the disparity felt as vast as that between heaven and earth.\nGuan Qianshan had even noticed people giving him strange looks, and he’d overheard the foremen gossiping about him behind his back:\n\"I heard he screwed up at headquarters and got directly exiled to this forsaken place.\"\n\"Really? No wonder he looks so bitter.\"\n\"Exactly! And I heard it was a top order from the group itself!\"\n\"A top order? That would be from the Chairman, right?\"\n\"Geez, looks like this Mr. Guan is going to be stuck here until retirement.\"\n\"Hehe, not necessarily. Maybe he’ll find a better place to go...\"\n\"How could it be that easy? Even though he’s been exiled, he still gets his salary. Doesn’t he want to get a better Pet Beast for his kid to secure a future?\"\n\"Ah... life is tough for everyone.\"\nGuan Qianshan sighed deeply.\nIt would be utter nonsense to say I have no regrets,\nhe thought.\nBut regarding Su Ping and the Su Family, I truly did the best I could. As for resorting to underhanded tricks, like restricting the Su Family’s income to force them to relinquish the land deed to survive, or other such despicable methods, I honestly couldn’t bring myself to do it. After all, when that fellow Su Anyong just up and left, he didn’t forget to ask me to look after the boy who was left home alone.\nThinking of this, Guan Qianshan actually began to worry about Su Ping. He didn’t know why the Chairman and Tianyun Group were so desperate to acquire the Su Family’s land deed, but there had to be a significant reason.\nI wonder if our group managed to get it,\nhe thought.\nHowever, just then, his phone rang, startling him slightly and breaking his train of thought.\nSpeak of the devil?\nhe thought, glancing at the caller ID.\n\"Hello, Su Ping?\" Guan Qianshan asked, somewhat surprised. He genuinely feared some accident had occurred.\nHowever, the boy’s voice on the other end of the line made the usually unflappable middle-aged company man freeze on the spot:\n\"Uncle Guan, I know you’re not having a good time over there at Tianyun Group. How about coming to Heart of Woods and working with me?!\"\nThe youthful voice, full of vitality, resonated through the phone with such confidence and vigor. So much so that he momentarily forgot to ask about salary or benefits, instinctively replying:\n\"Okay!\"\n「...」\nManager Guan returned to Heart of Woods. He felt somewhat dazed.\nHalf a month ago, he was the manager of the resort next door, representing Tianyun Group. Now, he had returned as the so-called ’manager’ of Heart of Woods.\nAlthough Tianyun Group had exiled him, they hadn’t skimped on his salary or benefits. And now, with just a word from Su Ping, he had resigned and come here. Lao Guan himself felt he must have been a bit crazy.\n\"Uncle Guan, how much was your monthly salary over at Tianyun Group?\"\n\"Not counting bonuses, about thirty thousand or so.\"\n\"Then your monthly salary at Heart of Woods will be sixty thousand, plus there are some other benefits. I’ll go into detail when we have time,\" Su Ping said generously, waving his hand.\nManager Guan sighed with relief. Although he trusted Su Ping, a man still needed to eat. At his age, it wasn’t just about feeding himself; he also had a family to support.\nHowever, while relieved, Manager Guan was also curious and asked, \"Su Ping, what do I need to do?\"\nThis Pet Beast Breeding Base was different from the resort’s training ground next door. There were many people at the resort; accommodation and dining were all-inclusive. Not to mention, there were also the complex affairs related to Pet Beast battles.\nHere, I really can’t see what I’m supposed to do,\nhe thought.Su Ping looked seriously at Guan Qianshan and said, \"Uncle Guan, in the future, Heart of Woods will become Linzhou’s largest Pet Beast Breeding Base and ecological plaza. Dad and I don’t know many people here, and you are the only one we can trust! That’s why we want you to be the manager!\"\nTrue friends are revealed in times of hardship,\nGuan Qianshan nodded.\nAfter all, Su Ping rescued me from that godforsaken place and is willing to pay me such a high salary. He’s truly shown utmost benevolence.\nThis trust now made Lao Guan incredibly moved.\nBut my question hasn’t been answered yet,\nhe thought.\nWhat exactly does a manager at Heart of Woods do?\nFacing Lao Guan’s puzzled look, Su Ping continued, \"As a manager, naturally, you have to oversee everything. You have to handle our business operations down to the smallest detail and have some understanding of every position.\"\nListening to Su Ping, Lao Guan suddenly had a bad feeling.\n\"Of course, for now, Heart of Woods hasn’t expanded its operations much. It’s mainly that we have more customers coming to seek cultivation for their pets, and you’ll need to receive them!\"\nA receptionist, huh?\nLao Guan sighed in relief.\n\"No problem!\" he said, thumping his chest in assurance.\n\"Also, I’m planning to expand the area around Heart of Woods, beyond the land already owned by my family. Uncle Guan, do you think you could figure something out for this?\"\n\"Ah? Some of those are existing shops with owners, and some is undeveloped land. It seems we’ll need to liaise with the authorities. But I’m good at this sort of thing; it’s no problem. I’ll go talk to each of them when the time comes.\"\n\"And then there’s the architectural planning. Uncle Guan, in the future at our Heart of Woods...\" Su Ping continued, outlining various aspects.\n「Two hours later.」Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nAfter listening to Su Ping’s entire blueprint, Lao Guan—who, in addition to manager, had seemingly also become the security guard, doorman, receptionist, PR specialist, construction supervisor, accountant, purchaser, landscape designer, and chef, all rolled into one—had only one thought:\nDamn it, I was too careless!",

      "content": "Chapter 77: Chapter 77: Old Sha’s First Phase, Perfecting ’Accelerated Spellcasting’!\nAlthough Lao Guan was very indignant, it must be said that professionals are certainly efficient when it comes to taking action.\nAnd soon, he had the work schedule well planned.\nAfter all, before this, the Heart of Woods only received customers in the morning, which gave Lao Guan the energy and time to arrange other tasks.\nIndeed, the task previously assigned to Lao Guan included acquiring surrounding land deeds. Su Ping wanted to continue expanding his base’s area to create more terrain types, thereby increasing the scale and variety of Pet Beasts he could nurture.\nThe growth of Pet Beasts could shape different terrains according to their individual needs; Forest Wolves, for example, were suited to growing in forests, but this might not be the case for others. Even with a Beast Taming Space, expanding the Pet Beast Breeding Base was necessary. Though the Beast Taming Space would grow with its owner’s Realm, it hadn’t quite reached a truly exaggerated level; at least, his current Realm and power were not up to that. Moreover, unlike the outside world, the Beast Taming Space was blessed with the various attributes of a Beast Tamer and, nourished by spiritual power, was a treasure trove for cultivating precious resources. Therefore, it wasn’t practical to permanently house a particularly large number of Pet Beasts there, and Su Ping couldn’t possibly move everything he owned into the Beast Taming Space.\nThus, Su Ping had an exceedingly clear understanding of the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base and the Beast Taming Space—two places that seemed to serve the same function but actually focused on completely different aspects.\nThe Beast Taming Space served as temporary quarters for combat Pet Beasts during expeditions and also as his personal treasure trove for cultivating precious resources.\nThe cultivation base, on the other hand, was essential for close contact and nurturing a large number of Pet Beasts.\nIt was also his true home base.\nA satisfied and content smile appeared on Su Ping’s face; he was already envisioning the next main group of Pet Beasts to focus on developing.\nNaturally, his preference was the Paperman. After all, the second Pet Beast he had prepared was the little Paperman, still diligently practicing its swordplay under his continued coaxing. Enhancing the Paperman Illustrated Handbook was undoubtedly an important matter. However, the habitats required by Necromancy System Pet Beasts often conflicted with those of other Pet Beasts, making arrangements difficult most of the time. Besides, he was still a Minor Realm and a Great Realm threshold away from breaking through to Elite Level, so he wasn’t in a rush.\nShaking his head, after arranging everything, Su Ping once again came out of the woods to the very center of the estate.\nWithin a considerable radius, not a single wall or tree stood—only the solitary figure of Old Sha, standing upright.\nHis four paws were buried deep in the soil.\nMeanwhile, the chopped trees in the large vat before Old Sha were almost completely devoured.\nOld Sha’s body seemed to gather the sunlight from the sky, slowly absorbing it into his entire body.\nAt that moment, Old Sha’s fur radiated a peculiarly special glow.\nThe radiance was so intense it was somewhat blinding to behold.\nAnd at this moment, Su Ping couldn’t help but squint as he observed Old Sha’s condition.\nOld Sha’s perception was extremely keen. The slightest rustle of leaves or movement of grass could not escape his notice.\nYet now, even as Su Ping approached to within twenty-odd meters of him and watched him for quite some time, Old Sha showed no reaction.\nStanding there, he seemed to be asleep on his feet.\nSu Ping could sense, through Old Sha’s breathing rate and the corresponding flickering light on his body, that Old Sha was in absolutely no mortal danger.\nChanges and differences had indeed occurred!\nSu Ping’s heart became extremely excited in an instant, and he even unconsciously pursed his lips, afraid of waking Old Sha from this state.\nHe quickly pulled out his notebook, recording the changes in Old Sha’s condition.\nThen, he gently departed, simultaneously checking the nearby camera that was continuously aimed at Old Sha before nodding in satisfaction.\nThe evolution process had to be fully recorded for later analysis.\nNow that Old Sha had completely entered this state, Su Ping just had to wait for him to comprehend Photosynthesis, a trait unique to Plant Type Pet Beasts. After that, he could begin pouring in resources.\nBesides the Sun Crystal, he estimated that the other resources he had purchased would arrive tomorrow.\nExhaling, Su Ping glanced at the gradually westward-slanting sun and went directly to the side room where the Paperman resided.\nDuring the day, the Paperman had returned to the Secret Realm. For the past two days, Su Ping hadn’t had much energy to oversee the Paperman. However, when he checked occasionally at night, he found the Paperman was training quite diligently.\nThis little guy had an indescribable stubbornness.\nThinking of this, Su Ping turned on the television in the living room.\nThen, he saw a notification below: several movies, each a few hours long, had been cycled through a total of three times in just a few short days.\nLooking at this cycle count, Su Ping’s eyelid twitched; he suddenly had a rather bad premonition.\nSuppressing this unfounded sense of foreboding, Su Ping sat on the sofa. Instead of rewatching those well-worn movies, he closed his eyes for a moment, merging his consciousness into the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas.\nThe gains from attending classes at the Breeder Association had far exceeded Su Ping’s expectations. The Sun Crystal was one benefit. What Su Ping truly hadn’t expected was an additional full five hundred Experience Points. This amount of Experience Points was enough to make another fortuitous acquisition his own: Accelerated Casting. Also known as Speedy Spellcasting, it was a common, attributeless Skill. It was also a purely passive ability that accelerated skill casting times, with broad applications. Taking Xiao Qing’s Poison Vine Wrap as an example, the time taken for the poison vine to condense and form, and the time for it to pursue and entangle its target, all counted as casting time. The effectiveness of this Skill was evident. Previously, Su Ping hadn’t been in a hurry. However, with the Paperman now present, and wanting to further coax and motivate it, perfecting this Skill became quite urgent. Since he was going to master it sooner or later, the mere five hundred Experience Points were not something the current Su Ping even took seriously.\nSo, while waiting for the Paperman to arrive, Su Ping stopped hesitating. The five hundred Experience Points flowed like water into this endeavor.\nAt the same time, under the \"Special Cultivation, Evolution Method\" line in the Forest Wolf Catalog, the entry for Accelerated Casting shone even brighter.\nHowever, the reaction wasn’t as significant as when he had perfected the Wanmu Wolf evolution.ᴛhis ᴜpdated by NovᴇlFirenᴇt\nThis made sense; after all, perfecting Accelerated Casting wouldn’t only enhance and benefit the Forest Wolf. It transformed from being effective only on the Forest Wolf to being applicable in the cultivation of all Pet Beasts.\nThinking of this, Su Ping’s interest grew even stronger as he examined this altered Accelerated Casting cultivation method.",

This is used to advance its Level, with the amount of Skill usage each day increasing by twenty percent from the previous day’s, and the consumption of resources must also be daily! Typically, cultivation is completed in five to seven days.]\n[Pet Beast Attributes, Level, Type, etc., Resource Analysis: Use resources of the same Level as the Pet Beast and resources of the same Attribute as the Pet Beast. For Pet Beast Types: Plant Type should use water, soil, and energy-type resources; Animal Type should use consumable resources; Undead Type should use energy-type resources and other quick-acting resources. Furthermore, after the Pet Beast uses its Skills on that day, it cannot release any other Skills.]ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\n[Note: During cultivation, prepare a large amount of Magic Potions for Energy recovery, in case the Pet Beast quickly depletes its Energy and cannot complete the expected cultivation.]\n[Note: During cultivation, the shorter the interval between Skill releases, the better!]\nIt has to be said, this cultivation method isn’t really that difficult.\nEven Su Ping saw it as relatively simple.\nThe cultivation method Sun Chaoju used previously was actually quite similar: letting the Pet Beast frequently use a single Skill while also consuming corresponding resources daily. However, Sun Chaoju only used it for the Forest Wolf, and the resources were fixed, unlike the perfected method, where resource use became more flexible.\nNo wonder the success rate of Sun Chaoju’s cultivation varied.\nIn fact, Pet Beasts are different from each other. Even among the same species of Forest Wolves, some absorb certain types of resources better, while for others, the effects might be unsatisfactory.\nAll of these could potentially be the reasons why a Pet Beast might fail to fully grasp Accelerated Casting.\nAs a Breeder, one must adapt and apply knowledge flexibly based on the Pet Beast, not just rely on rote memorization.\nOtherwise, the final outcome is predictable.\nInitially, it wasn’t Sun Chaoju himself who attempted the awakening on Woodhead. Instead, his subordinate low-level Breeders and apprentices used rote memorization, which led to Woodhead’s failure to grasp Accelerated Casting.\nAnd the same principle applies to other types of Pet Beasts.\nSu Ping couldn’t be bothered to think about cultivating other Pet Beasts. For now, his focus was naturally on the Forest Wolf and Paperman, and how to cultivate Accelerated Casting in them.\nIt must be said that the cultivation cost of Accelerated Casting is much higher than that of his own Heart of Woods.\nThe Heart of Woods is just a Magic Potion. Accelerated Casting, however, requires more. Besides the daily consumption of specific resources, one must also prepare Energy recovery Magic Potions. This is to prevent the Pet Beast from running out of Energy and failing to complete the required Skill usage.\nThinking about it this way, when Woodhead reached Elite Peak, Sun Chaoju’s people demanding three million worth of cultivation materials from Qin Xiaoxue wasn’t really extortion, in a sense.\nFor the Forest Wolf, he could somewhat copy the methods Sun Chaoju had used. For Ordinary Level, materials like Gold Tree Fruit could be used, and for Elite Level, Crystal Grapes, Spirit Tree Berries, and the like.\nBut what about the Necromancy Series?\nFor an Undead Pet Beast like Paperman, the ideal supplementary food would be paper. However, it could survive without paper, as Undead Types are not demanding about food. Moreover, since paper is made from tree bark, plants, and other such materials, it’s not unsuitable for consumption.\nWith just a thought, Su Ping came up with several low-level Necromancy Series resources worth trying. With that in mind, Su Ping opened his eyes and nodded. However, before he could fully process this, he abruptly stood up.\nThe reason was that right in front of him, on the coffee table, stood something. Su Ping recognized the body—it was Paperman’s—but the face instantly sent a cold shiver down his spine. For the first time in his life, he felt his ’sanity points’ plummeting.\nOn the Paperman’s face, which should have had human features, all other facial characteristics were gone. Even the previous blush had vanished, replaced by a bizarre ’A’! Yes, just a pitch-black ’A’. Even more abstractly, below this ’A’ was a ’◇’ symbol.\nWhat the heck is this?\nFortunately, the little Paperman, seemingly not expecting Su Ping’s strong reaction, was also startled. \"WOAH? (What’s wrong... Master?)\" it uttered.\nIndeed, it was the little Paperman. Su Ping looked at the little fellow’s A-shaped face, his eyelids twitching rapidly. \"What’s up with your face?\" he asked.\nAt this, the little Paperman appeared extremely proud, though it was quite a challenge for Su Ping to discern any proud expression on that face. \"WOAH. (A true Swordsman... should never let anyone read his expressions to guess his thoughts!)\" it declared.\nThe little Paperman was citing lines from the Swordsman videos it had watched over the past few days.\n\"So?\" Su Ping looked at the little Paperman, which had its arms crossed and had given him such a shock after not seeing it for several days. He was puzzled by its meaning.\nSo it turned its face into an A?\nAcross his past and present lives combined, he had only ever heard of an \"A-shaped waist,\" never an \"A-shaped face\"! And with a ’◇’ too, what kind of ghost was that?\nIn response to Su Ping’s question, the little Paperman suddenly perked up, seeming excited and thrilled that even its ’Master’ hadn’t grasped this layer of meaning. \"WOAH!! (So, every Swordsman should have a poker face!)\" it exclaimed.\n???\nIt was only then that Su Ping understood. Looking at the utterly abstract ’A’ on the little Paperman’s face and the pitch-black ’◇’ below it, he realized—\nthis was supposed to be a poker face?! It was the first time in Su Ping’s entire life he’d heard that this was what a poker face looked like.\n\"How did you know what poker is?\"\nThe little Paperman skillfully opened a drawer and took something out. Sure enough, it produced a deck of playing cards.\n\"WOAH! (I will become the strongest Swordsman, so my poker face is the biggest A!!)\" the little Paperman declared, full of pride.\nSu Ping buried his face in his hand.\n\"Then why did you choose this suit? Aren’t spades or hearts bigger?\" After glancing at the rule explanation card included with the deck of playing cards, Su Ping asked curiously.\nThis time, however, the little Paperman seemed somewhat sheepish. It opened its mouth and said with embarrassment, \"WOAH... (The shape of hearts, that’s too hard to draw...)\"\nSu Ping suddenly felt that to prevent his designated second Pet Beast from coming up with such abstract oddities, he really needed to pay close attention to the little Paperman’s psychological development. Also, he should take the opportunity in the next few days to cultivate its Accelerated Casting.",

      "content": "Chapter 79: Chapter 79 Busy, Prospects of Space Characteristics!\nLinzhou City Center.\nAtop a towering skyscraper, Dong Muyun, dressed in a sharp business suit, looked down at a person kneeling on one knee before her in the vast office on the highest floor.\nIt was hard to imagine that the practice of kneeling still existed in this day and age.\nYet, neither of them felt the slightest bit uncomfortable, and the kneeling person began to speak directly.\n\"Miss, the information on Su Ping that you asked me to investigate has been gathered.\"ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\n\"Speak.\"\n\"Su Ping, eighteen years old this year, graduated from Linzhou’s Sixth Basic Beast Taming Academy. His grandfather, Su Zhongguang, was a Monarch Level Beastmaster who sacrificed himself to defend against the Beast Tide in Linzhou twenty years ago, leaving behind the Heart of Woods Pet Beast Breeding Base. His father, Su Anyong, is a layabout who has never shown any Beast Tamer abilities; his strength is unknown. Recently, he left Linzhou for Beihai City. Our family’s influence doesn’t extend much into the northeast region, so the purpose of his trip there remains unknown...\"\nDong Muyun was getting impatient. \"Don’t tell me that after all these days, this is all you’ve found? I don’t need this kind of information!\"\n\"Yes. After Su Ping graduated, in a very short time, it seems he adjusted and improved upon the secret breeding formula left by his grandfather, Su Zhongguang. He developed the cultivation results of the Forest Wolf’s Heart of Woods. Then, by a stroke of fate, he met Liu Fuhai and subsequently obtained the Intermediate Level Breeder certification from the Breeder Association...\"\nIf Su Ping were here, he would surely realize that the speaker was now revealing all his recent activities quite clearly. Apart from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, everything Su Ping did in contact with the outside world over the past month had been thoroughly scrutinized.\nAnd the more she heard, the darker Dong Muyun’s expression became. \"Qin Erlong’s granddaughter? How did she come to know this brat and form a close relationship...\"\nThe person kneeling on one knee was also puzzled. \"It seems to be precisely because of the connection through the Heart of Woods cultivation. Moreover, Miss Qin clearly values this Su Ping very highly... Some days ago, she even used her connections to send him an extremely precious resource through the mail.\"\n\"What resource?\" Dong Muyun looked at her servant with suspicion. This family servant had served the Dong Family for decades and was naturally well-informed.\nIf he called it extremely precious, what could it be?\n\"The Stone of Creation.\"\nDong Muyun’s eyes widened in shock. \"What?\"\n\"The Stone of Creation, a resource used by Emperor Level Peak Beastmasters, can awaken additional Space Characteristics like ’ecological cycle’ within the Beast Taming Space.\"\nOf course, Dong Muyun knew what the Stone of Creation was, but what she didn’t understand was, what kind of enchantment did this brat work on that young lady to make her give up such a thing? She hadn’t even used such a thing herself! Even the unknown Secret Realm’s highest-valued resources might not compare to the Stone of Creation—it was still uncertain.\n\"Dong Si, I want accurate information, not some baseless rumors! This Qin Xiaoxue, even as the granddaughter of Qin Erlong, the head of Jianghai Province’s Beast Master Association, doesn’t have the authority to mobilize resources of that level from the Magic Capital Academy for an outsider, does she?!\"\nDong Muyun immediately felt like the person before her was talking nonsense.\nDong Si gave a wry smile, then slowly stood up, moved beside Dong Muyun, and whispered something into her ear. Afterward, under the young lady’s astonished and horrified gaze, he returned to his original position and continued speaking before she could react, \"Miss, the fact that she didn’t deliberately suppress the news from spreading indicates a certain vague attitude. Even the Dong Family wouldn’t dare to take that gamble...\"\nDong Muyun slowly came to her senses, her teeth biting her red lips. She said fiercely, \"So you’re telling me, I really can’t do anything about that little bastard?\"\n\"...\"\nBANG!\nA piece of precious crystal porcelain shattered into fragments.\n「...」\nPHEW!\nLying in bed, Su Ping finally let out a long breath.\nSo tired. During the day, training the Forest Wolves required constant attention to their movements. He had to run back and forth due to their large numbers to prevent serious injuries, leaving him physically exhausted. Then, Old Sha began its evolution. For the next three to four days, he had to watch over Old Sha, ensuring it chewed wood, consumed Wood Spirit Herbs, and Hundred Herbs Juice to facilitate moisture while also absorbing sunlight. He also had to record everything that happened during this evolution process, so his brain was tired. Now, at night, he needed to increase contact with the little Paperman, trying to further improve their relationship and begin cultivating Accelerated Casting, which made him mentally even more drained. Overall, for the past two days, apart from exhaustion, he really couldn’t identify any other feeling. Of course, alongside the tiredness, there was an indescribable sense of satisfaction.\nThe Heart of Woods now, compared to when he took over a month ago, was completely transformed and vastly different. Beyond Old Sha and Xiao Qing, he had a total of fifty Forest Wolves. The previous twenty-five all now possessed the Heart of Woods, and their strength was growing with extreme rapidity. Originally, there were only seven at Elite Level, but in this short period, the number of Elite Level Forest Wolves had directly broken through to fifteen. Although Xiao Qing hadn’t advanced her Realm like he had, she could also feel some improvement. Then there was the effect of the linked Skill Cultivation. After Su Ping’s Level rose to Ordinary Ninth Rank, the linking effect could simultaneously cover nineteen of them. The speed of skill improvement was so fast that almost every day, one or two Forest Wolves completed their advancement. If nothing unexpected happened, it was probably unrealistic and impossible for all these Forest Wolves to achieve Perfection Level, but reaching at least Proficiency, with the top ones becoming Proficient, was absolutely no problem.\nSuch an elite Forest Wolf team, once Su Ping made his breakthrough, could be placed into the Beast Taming Space. When that time came, whoever dared to defy him would face a direct release of the hounds!\nThinking of this scene made Su Ping reveal a slight smile, but then his thoughts turned to another matter.\nIt wasn’t about Old Sha’s evolution. Old Sha was still absorbing sunlight, and the time had not yet come for him to comprehend Photosynthesis. What Su Ping was thinking about was something else. These past two days, as he further interacted with the little Paperman and began to cultivate its Accelerated Casting, he could feel that its closeness to him had increased again. Therefore, Su Ping asked the little Paperman about that Secret Realm. As for whether there would be any movement from Dong Muyun’s side regarding this Secret Realm, Su Ping still didn’t know. Thus, he wanted to understand as much as possible, but unfortunately, although the little Paperman had no intention of hiding anything, it didn’t make itself clear enough. Its expressions were not clear. After all, although the little Paperman’s intelligence was stronger than many Ordinary Level Pet Beasts, it was still an Ordinary Level Pet Beast.\nIt’s a pity that he couldn’t enter now; the little Paperman also expressed that it couldn’t bring other people back \"home.\" Of course, even if he could enter, Su Ping was not foolish enough to just enter indiscriminately at this time. Who knew what might be inside? Regardless, he would have to wait until he had a certain level of strength. The little Paperman was safe there, but he was not so naive. Its Sword Soul Mark had a significant connection to this Secret Realm, but he was a genuine outsider. At the very least, he had to wait until Old Sha completed its evolution and truly became the Wanmu Wolf, and with the help of the wolf pack, only then would Su Ping have some confidence. It would be even better if he could find a bodyguard!\nHe shook his head.\nWho knew when the Secret Realm would truly appear. Moreover, its emergence would definitely be preceded by signs. The sudden appearance of the little Paperman was probably a special case. Unfortunately, on one hand, Su Ping’s understanding of some of the advanced knowledge and experiences in the world of Beast Tamers was really not extensive, making him actually want to go back to school. And now, he couldn’t casually talk or ask about the little Paperman’s situation to avoid arousing others’ covetousness. It was better to wait until he reached the Elite Level himself and completely formed a contract with the little guy, making it a Contracted Beast, before feeling a bit of confidence.\nWith this thought, Su Ping slowly closed his eyes and once again immersed his spiritual power into the Beast Taming Space.\nThat narrow and cramped, dim space now had a special feeling of emerging from darkness into the light. It was as if a single lamp instantly illuminated a thousand-year-old dark chamber, dispelling all gloom and darkness with a trace of light. At the same time, he even felt wisps of wind in his own Beast Taming Space! That’s right, for the first time, there was airflow in his Beast Taming Space! This was the divine effect of the Stone of Creation. These past few days, Su Ping had been so busy that he hardly touched the ground, yet his Meditation Realm still improved to a certain extent. All thanks to the Stone of Creation. And now that there was the first change in airflow inside the Beast Taming Space, its significance was extraordinary. The ecological cycle, a Space Characteristic, makes the ecological environment basically similar to the rules of the outside world and is suitable for almost all Beast Taming Spaces. It also enhances the effects of many other Space Characteristics.\nSatisfied, he nodded.\nHe was really looking forward to seeing what Space Characteristics, in addition to this ecological cycle, would appear after his breakthrough to the Elite Level. He hoped to get some that had high potential and strong effects. As for whether they would be combat-oriented, healing, cultivation, or Resource Type Space Characteristics, Su Ping didn’t mind any particular type. All four had their benefits. However, if he had to choose, Resource Type characteristics were certainly more flexible, allowing for the production of resources that could be sold or exchanged if not needed, right? True, Resource Type characteristics were very average in effect when a Beast Tamer’s Realm was low. However, combat and cultivation Space Characteristics demanded higher requirements from Pet Beasts; if they didn’t share the same category or Attribute, the effects would diminish.\nWith this curiosity and anticipation for the future, Su Ping could no longer hold on. Without even washing up, he simply fell into a deep sleep.",

      "content": "Chapter 80: Chapter 80 Photosynthesis, Old Sha’s Transformation!\nThe sun rose in the east.\nThe dazzling, fiery orb eternally burst forth with everlasting light and heat. Beyond being a star of flame, it was also the source of Life for countless beings.\nAll things revived, everything awakening with new vitality as the sun arose. The morning dew quickly dried, and the people living in the city began their busy day.\nSu Ping was no exception, although he had risen comparatively late, well past sunrise.\nStill with sleep in his eyes, Su Ping yawned. Without hurrying to wash his face, he had already reached Old Sha’s training ground on the outskirts of the forest, a place he checked first every day. Only after looking there would he feel reassured enough to check on the Forest Wolf’s training situation.\nHowever, this morning, the moment Su Ping took a look, any lingering sleepiness instantly vanished. His eyes widened in astonishment; disregarding his pajamas and slippers, he ran straight into the reinforced glass enclosure to Old Sha’s side.\nThis was because Old Sha was exhibiting new changes, differences never seen before. These changes had never been recorded in Sun Chaoju’s notes on the Wanmu Wolves.\nOld Sha himself appeared unchanged. He even shifted his gaze when he noticed Su Ping’s arrival, a glint of excitement in his eyes. However, he seemed to be maintaining that unique breathing rhythm and made no sound. Clearly, Old Sha faced no risk of mental rigidity or petrification.\nIndeed, Su Ping could tell that with Old Sha’s unique breathing rhythm, every hair on his body seemed to respire, engaging in an exceptionally distinct form of ’breathing’. Each strand of fur was continuously unfurling.\nThis phenomenon shouldn’t occur in an animal-type Pet Beast; it was mostly associated with plants. This was because the ability was known as Photosynthesis. Through sunlight, it absorbed light Energy, synthesized organic compounds from carbon dioxide and water, and converted them into oxygen... This was one of nature’s most fundamental Energy conversion processes.\nSu Ping could accept all this. In this wondrous Controlling Beasts world, while he didn’t understand how animal-type Pet Beasts could master such an Ability, he could accept the premise.\nHowever, while Old Sha himself seemed fine, the surroundings were a major issue. On the lawn, everything around Old Sha had withered and yellowed.\nWas it the Heart of Woods forcibly absorbing the Life Energy of the surrounding plants?\nHad Old Sha forcibly activated the effects of the Heart of Woods?!\nImpossible!\nSu Ping had absolute trust in Old Sha’s obedience to his commands! This was a trust forged over many years of companionship, akin to that between family members.\nSo what was the real reason?\nCould the Heart of Woods truly cause the Wanmu Wolf’s Evolution to undergo such changes?\nSu Ping’s brows furrowed deeply; he didn’t know if this change was good or bad. Ultimately, it was because his knowledge base in Cultivation was too shallow.Follow current novels on ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nNevertheless, Su Ping hastily used the Eye of Truth to examine Old Sha:\n[Forest Wolf (wild)]\n[Current Level: Leader Second Rank]\n[Racial Potential: Elite Tenth Stage]\n[Skills: Sunlight Absorption (Perfection), Vine Strangling (Proficient), Self-Healing (Proficient), Accelerated Growth (Proficient), Wolf King (Beginner), Heart of Woods (Proficient), Photosynthesis (Beginner)]\nAs expected, Old Sha had mastered Photosynthesis, a Skill typically found only in plant-based organisms.\nHowever, Su Ping’s attention wasn’t solely on Photosynthesis. He looked at another Skill that, as he anticipated, had also changed:\nHeart of Woods (Proficient)!\nYes, Old Sha’s Heart of Woods had leveled up again?\nIt had reached the Proficient Level.\nPerhaps this breakthrough wasn’t a huge deal in itself. The reason was simple: Old Sha was the first to acquire the Heart of Woods Skill. Moreover, if they possessed the Connection and Sharing ability, a rapid increase in Skill Level was to be expected—that was its inherent effect!\nAfter all, it wasn’t just Old Sha. Even Woodhead, after only half a month here, had its Heart of Woods level up. Xiao Qing’s Heart of the Poison Wood had also reached the Proficient Level. In fact, within the past few days, a few other Pet Beasts with good aptitude had also achieved a similar advancement in their Heart of Woods.\nBut that wasn’t the crucial part!\nThe reason was simple: Old Sha hadn’t been part of any Connection and Sharing for a long time. In other words, his Heart of Woods had advanced purely on its own!\nHow could that be possible?!\nSu Ping knew all too well how difficult it was to advance the Heart of Woods. If such a passive Ability, especially one acquired later through Cultivation, could level up so easily, Old Sha wouldn’t have struggled for over forty years just to barely break his race limit, failing even to achieve Evolution.\nThen, this advancement must have occurred during the current evolutionary stage.\nWithout a second thought, Su Ping didn’t even greet Old Sha. He rushed to the video recorder and played back the night’s footage at eight times speed to see what had transpired.\nThe recording began from when he left the previous evening.\nDuring the night, Old Sha seemed to have acclimated to this lifestyle. The discomfort from the first two days was gone. Instead, he had thoroughly immersed himself in what could be described as a plant-like state, resembling a lethargic, cold-blooded animal that moved only when necessary. Therefore, there were no unusual changes that night.\nAnd just as expected, when the sun gradually rose on the horizon and sunlight poured down, Old Sha began performing Sunlight Absorption as usual. However, over the past few days, Old Sha had reached a critical threshold in the Wanmu Wolf’s second stage.\nAs he continuously absorbed sunlight, Old Sha’s luminescence intensified. Under the radiant light, a distinctive breathing rhythm emerged from him. With each inhale and exhale, the sunlight bathing his body seemed to fuse completely with Old Sha.\nThen, Su Ping’s eyes suddenly narrowed.\nHe focused on the high-definition video footage. Under the concentrated sunlight, as that unique breathing rhythm began, the grass and flowers in the surrounding meadow also seemed to be affected. Wisps of faint green light, like motes following the dazzling sunlight, slowly merged into Old Sha’s body as Su Ping watched intently.\nSubsequently, a touch of vibrant green essence emanated outwards, and Old Sha’s body appeared as if suddenly draped in a green blanket. Together with the sunlight, he entered an extremely peculiar state.\nThis state persisted for about three minutes before gradually fading, resulting in the scene Su Ping had just witnessed.",

      "content": "Chapter 81: Chapter 81: The Chemical Reaction of the Heart of Woods!\nPhotosynthesis + Sunlight Absorption could strengthen the effect of Heart of Woods and even accelerate its upgrade?\nFinally, Su Ping, dragging his slippers and wearing pajamas, squatted beside the camera on the lawn. After watching the footage over and over, he reached such a conclusion.\nAlthough, to him, the conclusion seemed somewhat unreliable, and he wasn’t even sure why, he felt both excited and scared. The excitement stemmed from having a new direction and more specialized insights into the research of Pet Beasts. The fear arose because what he initially thought to be a near-certain evolutionary Cultivation now had an unexpected twist. For now, this twist didn’t seem to have a significant impact; it could even be considered a good thing. An upgrade in skill Level is, of course, a good thing, but what lay ahead was not so certain.\nSu Ping took a deep breath and subconsciously licked the corner of his mouth. Suppressing the tension and anticipation in his heart, he actually wanted to conduct thorough experiments now, but it was Old Sha who was evolving. The first thing he needed to ensure was always Old Sha’s safety. As for the experiment, there was plenty of time in the future. Moreover, he could feel that the effects of Heart of Woods did not have a significant impact on Old Sha’s Evolution.\nPerhaps just more remarkable?\nNow that Old Sha had mastered Photosynthesis, it naturally indicated that he had entered the Third Rank of the Wanmu Wolf’s Evolution. At this stage, there was no rush to think about anything else. The most important thing at the moment was to find a way to boost Old Sha’s Photosynthesis Level. The rest could be dealt with slowly later on.Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nWith this in mind, Su Ping hastily made a call to Lao Guan.\nSoon after, Lao Guan came running over, spotting his young boss still in pajamas and slippers, his hair a mess like a bird’s nest.\nHe sighed with resignation, \"Boss, it’s nine o’clock. There might be visitors for a tour. Couldn’t you pay a bit more attention to your image?\"\n\"Mm-hmm, next time for sure, Uncle Guan, did you bring the stuff?\" Su Ping replied.\nLao Guan, speechless, took out a plastic bag and then brought over a large bucket, handing it to Su Ping. Su Ping took it eagerly and nodded in satisfaction after a quick glance. These were the two resources he had purchased a few days ago: Sunflower Smile Seeds and Sunlight Spring Water. Both were resources listed in the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas as necessary for the optimal Evolution of the Wanmu Wolf.\nSu Ping ignored Lao Guan and rushed over to Old Sha with the items.\nThrough the tempered glass, Guan Qianshan shook his head after a brief look but still showed a smile at the corner of his mouth. He finally understood how this kid managed to revitalize Heart of Woods and achieve so much in just a month. This little fellow truly loved Pet Beast Cultivation; he was a diligent and gifted talent indeed.\nWhy hadn’t I noticed this before?\nHowever, Guan Qianshan knew Cultivation was not for outsiders to watch, and he had no interest in observing further. Seeing such hard work from this young man, he thought,\nMaybe that vision I described to him could truly be realized by this youth’s hands? If that’s the case, then I, too, must work hard! At the very least, I need to ensure there are no issues with logistics. Otherwise, people might think I’m just here to fool a child.\nWith this thought, Guan Qianshan, a man in his forties, suddenly felt an inexplicable surge of energy he identified as ’drive’. Su Ping’s presence always seemed to inspire those around him.\n\"Old Sha, time for some seeds!\"\nSu Ping, holding the big pack of Sunflower Smile Seeds, sat down directly on the grass in front of Old Sha, seemingly unconcerned about his appearance.\nSunflower Smile is an Ordinary Level Plant Type Pet Beast that can absorb sunlight. It’s a common Resource Type Pet Beast that produces these sunflower seeds. They can replenish sunlight Energy, supply calcium, and the trace elements needed by both Pet Beasts and human Beast Tamers. It was a comparatively luxurious snack.\nSitting together with Old Sha, Su Ping tossed him a seed, then put one in his own mouth. Master and servant, man and wolf, sat on the lawn under the sun, cracking sunflower seeds. CRACK. CRACK. The sound was crisp and clear.\nHowever, Su Ping was not idle. He opened the notebook he had brought along, started a new page from the back, and commenced writing:\n’The effects of Photosynthesis mainly include: converting solar energy into chemical energy, and inorganic matter into organic matter.’\n’Photosynthesis is divided into light and dark reactions.’\n’It involves light absorption, electron transfer, photophosphorylation, carbon assimilation, and more.’\n’It is known that the overall equation for the light and dark reactions of Photosynthesis is: CO₂+6H₂O→C₆H₁₂O₆[(CH₂O)ₙ]+6O₂.’\n’After mastering the Skill, the Forest Wolf can undergo Photosynthesis within its body through the use of Skills to react...’\n’The Sunlight Absorption Skill is unique to the Forest Wolf, which enhances the sunbathing process by further absorbing trace elements from the sunlight, such as the known Vitamin D, etc...’\n’The Wood Heart Skill can forcibly absorb organic Energy Material from other plant life, through Photosynthesis and Sunlight Absorption...’\n’...’\nLines of text, incomprehensible to others, filled the page as Su Ping scribbled quickly, the research directions in his mind seemingly clarifying all at once.\nAlthough the Beastmaster Society of Blue Star is different from my previous world, Earth, and some physical, chemical, and biological knowledge doesn’t directly apply, it can often serve as a direct reference.\nHe focused on deconstructing the biological formula for Photosynthesis, integrating it with the Skills used on Plant Type Pet Beasts, and from there, deducing the specific effects of Heart of Woods on Photosynthesis and Sunlight Absorption.\nWhile thinking, his other hand didn’t stop moving. CLICK. He cracked open a refreshingly fragrant sunflower seed, then tossed another big handful to the expectant Old Sha. Old Sha caught them all in one gulp and swallowed them without even cracking the shells. Su Ping ignored the still hopeful Old Sha and, while chewing on the seeds, plunged back into his thoughts.\nThe effect of the photochemical reactions is indeed like that. Especially in this world, where Pet Beasts can awaken the Ability of Photosynthesis through resources and bloodlines. If I could take this Ability back to my previous world... wouldn’t it be really possible to use CO₂, carbon dioxide, to quickly make flour, and in large quantities at that? Of course, in essence, this technology could also be achieved in a laboratory, and whether or not it’s significantly useful is a matter of perspective.\nNow, what I need to do is analyze, on this basis, the enhancement effect of Heart of Woods. And ultimately, under the formulas of these three Skills, what kind of chemical reaction will there be! And what kind of changes and differences would such a chemical reaction undergo if placed in this Pet Beast World?\nThinking this, Su Ping scooped up another handful of seeds and passed them to Old Sha. He then spat out the seed husks and continued to work through formulas in his small notebook.\n「Shortly after」\nOutside the tempered glass fence, Guan Qianshan led guests to the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base, smiling as he introduced, \"Heart of Wood was a Cultivation base with some reputation even before. The founder, Mr. Su Zhongguang, was a Monarch Level Beast Tamer. And now, Breeder Su Ping, despite his young age, has already become an Intermediate Level Breeder and is highly regarded by the Breeder Association.\n\"It is also for this reason that our Heart of Wood’s Cultivation team has been booked for the next two months. However, Breeder Su is planning to speed up the Cultivation process so, if you choose to cultivate the ’Wood Heart Skill,’ booking now means the latest you might come for Cultivation is one month later.\"\nGuan Qianshan spoke eloquently, while the guests, looking through the tempered glass, stared curiously at the scene on the other side. Guan Qianshan had a bad feeling.\nSure enough, the young boss whom I warned to pay attention to his image three hours ago is now wearing blue pajamas with a cartoon image of a Q version Forest Wolf on them, sitting right there on the grass under the sun, cracking seeds and busily writing something. Who would find such an image reliable? It seems likely this deal is about to fall through.\nJust as he was about to speak up and provide an explanation, the customer spoke first, \"Is that Breeder Su? Truly diligent! Look at him, still in his pajamas, so devoted to the Cultivation work that he neglects sleep and food. No wonder he has such remarkable achievements at such a young age! It’s truly admirable.\"\nWith that, the customer turned and said, \"With such a Breeder here, it’s no wonder Heart of Wood has been receiving such great reviews recently! I’ll bring my daughter’s Little Forest Wolf over in a few days. Where do I pay the deposit?\"\nGuan Qianshan looked bewildered at the admiring customer before he belatedly realized and quickly responded, \"Oh, oh, please follow me. Choosing Heart of Wood is a decision you definitely won’t regret! Our Breeder Su is just such an outstanding and dedicated Breeder who doesn’t sweat the small stuff!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 82: Chapter 82: The Ultimate Formula, Paper Doll’s Accelerated Casting!\nThe words Guan Qianshan spoke that morning, he had initially hesitated to fully believe, but by evening, he couldn’t agree with them more.\nAll day, Su Ping hadn’t even left his seat on the grass. A few puzzled Forest Wolves lingered nearby, apparently collaborating with Su Ping on some experiment. He hadn’t even eaten, just shared some melon seeds with Old Sha. The rest of the time was spent scribbling, drawing, and smudging in that peculiar notebook.\nHe didn’t know what magic lay within those pages, but he knew the adage, \"Where there’s a will, there’s a way.\"\nAt this moment, Su Ping perfectly embodied this.\nIn just one day, he had filled ten pages of the notebook. Those ten pages were filled with speculation and formulaic calculations based on Sunlight Absorption, Photosynthesis, and the effects of Heart of Woods.\nActually, the principle was very simple once explained. Heart of Woods harnessed natural life energy from the Wood Element within plants; this natural life energy, although not belonging to any known substance from Su Ping’s previous life, was still an organic energy body. Photosynthesis helped plants convert sunlight energy at an upper level. Sunlight Absorption, then, at the very highest level, enabled Pet Beasts to obtain more sunlight for more efficient energy absorption.\nSo what about Heart of Woods?\nHeart of Woods, being at the lowest level, could restore this power to itself, rejuvenating its energy and healing injuries.ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ\nThus, Su Ping’s deduction was quite simple.\nCould these three skills form a perfect closed-loop cycle under such conditions? When energy was depleted, Sunlight Absorption drew in sunlight, Photosynthesis converted it, and Heart of Woods utilized the sunlight. This, in turn, would make the stronger Forest Wolf body’s use of Sunlight Absorption even more potent.\nHowever, applying this formula presented many paradoxes. To put it in layman’s terms, if translated into an online game, it meant the less health one had, the higher the damage one dealt; the higher the damage, the more health restored; and the more health restored, the higher the maximum health limit.\nSo, less health equals more health?\nAlthough the meaning was slightly different, the expression of the effect was roughly the same.\nThis conclusion seemed like utter nonsense to Su Ping, no matter how he looked at it. And it certainly wasn’t reflected in Old Sha. The energy conversion between Sunlight Absorption, Photosynthesis, and Heart of Woods couldn’t unify, like three pipes of different thicknesses that simply couldn’t be connected.\nForcing a connection would only result in leakage.\nBut looking at the dense notes in the notebook, and the final, extremely simple formula:\n’X=Y=Z=X2=Y2=Z2’\n’X+Y+Z=?’\nIf calculated mathematically, the result would be 0. But obviously, Pet Beast cultivation wasn’t a math problem, nor could it be reduced to simple numerical logic.\nHowever, this formula provided Su Ping with an answer—a very, very simple one: once the pipes were all of the same thickness, the results would naturally become evident.\nAnd what specifically caused the variance in the pipes’ thickness? The answer to this question was even simpler: the skill level.\nCurrently, among Old Sha’s skill levels, Sunlight Absorption had reached Perfection, Heart of Woods was at Proficient Level, and Photosynthesis, like Heart of Woods, was also at Proficient Level. In other words, perhaps the final answer to Su Ping’s formula would be revealed when Photosynthesis, Heart of Woods, and Sunlight Absorption all reached Perfection Level simultaneously.\nThat’s right; in just one day, Photosynthesis, like Heart of Woods, had broken through to Proficient Level. After munching on quite a few Smiling Sunflower Seeds and taking a moderate bath in Sunlight Spring water, this improvement was achieved. This showed that, putting other aspects aside, the evolution of the Wanmu Wolf, which the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas had perfected, was definitely not an issue.\nAs for when Old Sha would accumulate energy to its peak and complete its evolution, Su Ping had no clue.\nThus, Su Ping didn’t mind at all the resources needed by the Wanmu Wolf and poured them into Old Sha desperately. During the day, he even set up several mirrors around Old Sha to concentrate the sunlight even more, allowing Sunlight Absorption to gather more plentiful solar energy.\nHowever, Su Ping wasn’t in a rush to use the Sun Crystal on Old Sha. The first use of these two advanced resources yielded the best effect; one shouldn’t be hasty. Having just advanced to Proficient Level, Mastery and Perfection were two thresholds. It would undoubtedly be best to use these Lungs of Nature and the Sun Crystal when stuck at these thresholds.\nIndeed, Su Ping’s thinking was correct. After several more days of nurturing Old Sha under such conditions—bathed in rotating sunshine, with an ample supply of Smiling Sunflower Seeds and Sunlight Spring water—Photosynthesis showed no improvement.\nTherefore, without hesitation this time, Su Ping placed the newly purchased Lungs of Nature at Old Sha’s mouth and nose. The Lungs of Nature was a verdant green leaf that looked ordinary, but its effects were quite remarkable. This time, almost immediately after the Lungs of Nature took effect, Photosynthesis, under Su Ping’s observation, broke through from Proficient Level to Mastery Level.\nAs the effectiveness of Photosynthesis improved, every single hair on Old Sha’s body moved gently with each breath. From a distance, when still, it almost seemed to transform into a luminous plant organism shimmering under the sunlight.\nUtterly extraordinary!\nBut obviously, this still wasn’t enough! Old Sha’s Sunlight Absorption was at Perfection. Therefore, no matter what, Photosynthesis also had to reach Perfection Level.\nFortunately, according to Su Ping’s inquiries, the feedback from Old Sha suggested there was no rush for energy accumulation. At least, under the current circumstances, Old Sha didn’t seem to feel that special, imminent sensation of evolving.\nSo, using the Sun Crystal could wait until Old Sha had settled slightly and adapted to Photosynthesis at the Mastery Level; attempting the breakthrough then wouldn’t be too late. Moreover, on regular days, Su Ping could also determine the exact timing for using the Sun Crystal based on Old Sha’s condition. But today, Su Ping really didn’t have the time.\n「It had been a week since Old Sha had begun the Third Rank of cultivation, advancing from the Second Rank.」\nDuring this week, apart from continuing to supervise the training of the Forest Wolf pack and keeping records for Old Sha, there was also another, most important matter. The training of Accelerated Casting for the little Paperman had finally started in the first half of the night.\nThe cultivation of Accelerated Casting wasn’t very resource-consuming, especially when the creature in training was of a low level; it mostly needed Ordinary Level resources and some energy-restoring Magic Potions. But, in the first half of every night, the little Paperman would use the Jinge Technique under Su Ping’s special training. Initially, it cast it only about twenty times in a row, but over the past few days, the little Paperman tonight had continuously cast the Jinge Technique fifty times in the first half of the night!\nAnd today was the last day of cultivating Accelerated Casting for the little Paperman!",

Little Paper Man’s Intimacy Meets the Standard!\n\"Remember, today’s goal is sixty repetitions—and it must be completed before midnight! You’re only halfway there; it’s not time to rest yet!\"\nSu Ping’s voice echoed throughout the underground training room of this side chamber.\nThis basement had never been much for decoration. Though once neat and clean, it had taken on the style of a post-war reconstruction site after the cultivation of Accelerated Spellcasting for the little Paperman began.\nBut Su Ping clearly didn’t care.\nCompared to the cost of Pet Beast cultivation, the expense of remodeling was hardly worth mentioning.\nAnd right now, undoubtedly, was the most crucial moment!\nAmidst a series of cries from the little Paperman, a brilliant golden light flashed from his hands in an instant!\n\"Don’t worry!\"\n\"For the glory of a Swordsman!\"\n\"I must...\"\n\"I will definitely do it!\"\nIt was an incredibly dazzling blade light.\nIt was hard to imagine that such a massive blade light could burst forth from what was called a ’sword,’ made purely of stiff paper and just over ten centimeters long.\nIt was so powerful that it left a deep gash on the thick, reinforced concrete wall before them.\nEven though Su Ping had seen it almost every day for the past few days, he couldn’t help but feel amazed every time this blade light appeared.\nThis power is truly terrifying!\nIs this what the Perfection Level Jinge Technique looks like?\nMoreover, it wasn’t just sharp; this sword-drawing strike, the little Paperman’s own creation, was also surprisingly fast.\nPaired with the Sword Qi and blade light that surged from the Perfection Level Jinge Technique, it could inflict great damage from a distance.\nAfter all, for the Paperman, a Pet Beast dubbed the ’shame of the Necromancy System,’ its only somewhat noteworthy advantage was perhaps that its speed was slightly faster than ordinary Pet Beasts of the same rank.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\n\"Huff... huff...\"\nThe little Paperman gasped heavily, his ’poker face’ finally returning to an anime-style expression.\nAt this moment, due to the rapid and large consumption of Energy, his face showed distinct signs of strain, with thick beads of sweat appearing on one side.\nGiven that Papermen are Undead Pet Beasts belonging to the Necromancy System, they shouldn’t exhibit physiological reactions like sweating from physical exertion—where the hell is this sweat coming from?\nSu Ping inwardly scoffed.\nBut he didn’t say much.\nAs long as it wasn’t that bizarre ’Ace of Diamonds’ poker face, it was fine.\nHowever, Su Ping also noticed that the little Paperman had reached his limit.\nNormally, a common Ninth Rank Paperman, using its Racial Skill ’Paper Body Folding,’ could use it up to twenty times at most.\nBut the little Paperman before him had used the Jinge Technique thirty times—and at Perfection Level, no less—which was quite impressive.\nIndeed, over the past few days of training, by continually consuming ordinary Necromantic resources, the little Paperman had progressed and broken through his previous Level.\nHe had reached the common Ninth Rank.\nOriginally, back when he began the cultivation plan for Accelerated Spellcasting, Su Ping had considered having the little Paperman switch to practicing the ’Paper Body Folding’ ability.\nPaper Body Folding was considered the Paperman’s primary offensive ability, but its weakness as an offensive skill was almost unparalleled in the entire Pet Beast World.\nPerhaps only the utterly non-combat, caterpillar-like Insect-type Beasts could compare.\nThe effect of Paper Body Folding was quite interesting: it allowed the Paperman to freely change its body shape and control its form.\nFor example, if possible, the Paperman could instantly expand upon reaching an enemy’s side, enveloping the enemy in a paper cage.\nOf course, it went without saying how little restraining power a paper cage actually possessed.\nIt could also wrap around the weak points of animal-type Pet Beasts, suffocating or strangling them.\nStill, the power remained limited.\nAll in all, the Paperman’s Paper Body Folding was extremely flexible and seemed to offer great versatility, but its actual power was incredibly weak due to the Paperman’s low Racial Potential.\nBut no matter what, it’s still somewhat better than practicing the Jinge Technique to the max level, right?\nSu Ping thought.\nHowever, the little Paperman had a persistent devotion to Swordsmanship.\nThe little fellow would rather modify the slash of his sword-drawing style—part of the Jinge Technique—into a thrust than practice any other Skills.\nSo Su Ping didn’t insist further.\nLooking at the little Paperman panting from exhaustion, Su Ping directly took out the Necromantic resource Soul-Settling Paper and the energy-recovering Magic Potion he had prepared earlier, and handed them to him.\nThe little Paperman took them. \"Teacher...\" he cried, \"I will never forget your kindness for all eternity!\"\nIn no time at all, he skillfully swallowed the Soul-Settling Paper and the Magic Potion. His originally weak expression instantly became as fierce and determined as a warrior with a drawn sword, fully revitalized.\n\"A Swordsman... never gives up!\" he declared.\nWHOOSH!\nThe blade light from the Jinge Technique he had just retracted flashed out again. Without any prompting from Su Ping, the practice of the Jinge Technique resumed once more!\n\"A true Swordsman... must be relentless!\"\nWHOOSH!\n\"To become an Expert, one must learn to endure solitude and loneliness!\"\nWHOOSH!\n\"Because an Expert is forged from solitude and loneliness!\"\nWHOOSH!\nThe Jinge Technique’s sharp edges cut swiftly through the air, striking fiercely upon the sturdy metallic wall.\nIt was as if the little guy was encouraging himself. Each time he executed a sword strike, his body wavered because the Magic Potion couldn’t fully restore his energy.\nBut still, the little Paperman remained steadfast, delivering every slash.\nSuch willpower and conviction... perhaps it isn’t so bad if this little Paperman, so determined to become an expert Swordsman, is a bit overly dramatic,\nSu Ping suddenly thought.\nIt was under this sort of intense pressure, pushing himself to the brink of exhaustion, that the little Paperman actually completed sixty repetitions of the Jinge Technique just after eleven o’clock, before midnight.\nSu Ping looked directly at the little Paperman, who had collapsed limply onto the ground, utterly spent, his eyes depicted as swirling spirals of exhaustion.\nAnd at that very moment, an eerie fluctuation emanated from the little Paperman.\nThe next moment, the little Paperman seemed somewhat bewildered.\nHowever, Su Ping understood what was happening.\nJust as expected, within the Eye of Truth, feedback from the little Paperman slowly revealed the words \"Accelerated Spellcasting\"!\n[Accelerated Spellcasting (Beginner): Allows casting speed to increase, but accordingly, consumes a bit more Energy.]\nThe little Paperman’s eyes snapped open, and he looked around himself in astonishment. \"What is this?!\" he exclaimed.\n\"This is the new ability I’ve been teaching you. Feel it out, understand it, and get used to applying it properly!\"\n\"Huh?\" the little Paperman uttered, puzzled, blinking his slow-motion eyes, seeming to have instantly regained his spirit.\nHowever, at that very moment, the change Su Ping had long awaited finally occurred!\nUpon the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, an unfamiliar Catalog slowly lit up!\nNaturally, Su Ping understood: the intimacy level with the little Paperman had finally reached the required standard.",

      "content": "Chapter 84: Chapter 84 Origami Man Record Activated, Evolution Imminent?\nOn this Catalog entry, it was identical to the previous ones for the Forest Wolf and Luozisong, except that against the overall gray-white background, there was this similarly gray-white Paperman.\nHowever, the Paperman depicted was in the common form of a paper figure; its pale paper body, coupled with the chilling atmosphere, made it seem more like a quintessential Paperman.\nIn contrast, the little Paperman, with a folded conical hat on its head and dressed as a Swordsman, didn’t evoke this sense of cold terror. Instead, it possessed an indescribable cuteness stemming from this very contrast.\nBut Su Ping wasn’t concerned with these details right now. The goal he had striven for over many days was finally achieved, and he couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief.\nSubsequently, his attention slowly focused on the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas.\nSure enough, as soon as the Paperman’s Catalog entry fully lit up, the following information appeared piece by piece:\n[Catalog ’Paperman’ illuminated. Current Catalog Level: 1. Origin Reward: Rapid Recovery.]\n[Rapid Recovery (Beast Tamer Ability): Expends spiritual power to quickly restore the injuries, Energy, and stamina of Pet Beasts within the Beast Taming Space.]\nIndeed, this didn’t surprise Su Ping in the slightest.Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs NovᴇlFirenᴇt\nThe reward for illuminating the Paperman’s Catalog entry to Lv. 1 was, as expected, another Beast Tamer Talent.\nTruth be told, just based on these Talents alone, Su Ping had already far surpassed other Beast Tamers.\nOthers might have only one Beast Tamer Talent, but Su Ping now possessed a full four.\nApart from Pet Beast Home, Su Ping now finally possessed all three of what were known as the three great basic Beast Tamer Talents!\nAlthough such low-level Beast Tamer Talents didn’t provide a significant boost, it was, as they say, better to have them than not.\nTake the current situation, for example. Previously, restoring the little Paperman’s energy and stamina would have required healing Magic Potions and other resources. But now, with the Talents of Pet Beast Home and Rapid Recovery, Su Ping could bring the little Paperman into the Beast Taming Space and use Rapid Recovery, saving some of those costs.\nOf course, that was about the extent of it. Although Rapid Recovery could heal some injuries, it was limited to minor surface wounds. Severed limbs or severe internal injuries still required high-level healing-type Pet Beasts.\nHowever, Su Ping was neither discouraged nor disappointed. On the contrary, he was quite looking forward to what might come next.\nNow that he has acquired what are called the three fundamental Beast Tamer Talents, is it possible that illuminating new Catalog entries will grant him other Talents?\nOther Talents were one thing. However, abilities like Zhou Shuchen’s Fire Element Affinity were powerful Talents capable of permanently enhancing a Pet Beast’s combat capabilities.\nOtherwise, Zhou Shuchen, who had always felt inferior, wouldn’t have become so arrogant after contracting the Crimson Fang Tiger. Such a Talent naturally made one material for a professional combat-type Beast Tamer.\nHe just wasn’t sure if, as he suspected, every new Pet Beast Catalog entry he illuminated would allow him to comprehend a new Talent.\nHowever, if that were the case, with the unimaginable number of basic Pet Beast types, wouldn’t his future Talents also be unimaginable?\nAlthough it felt unlikely, Su Ping couldn’t help but harbor fond hopes for such a future prospect.\nOf course, thoughts aside, Su Ping quickly turned his attention to the Paperman’s Catalog entry that had just illuminated:\n[Catalog: Paperman]\n[A special low-level Necromancy Series Pet Beast with a frail body and strong malleability. It seems to possess quite impressive potential, though it requires specific development! Racial Skills: Paper Body Folding, Paper Body Joint, etc.]\n[Current Catalog Level: 1 (352/500)]\nKnown Evolutionary Pathways, Special Cultivation:\n[Secret Method for Cultivating Accelerated Casting: Can cultivate the skill ’Accelerated Spellcasting’.]\nPreferences, Habits:\n[Prefers cool, shaded places. Enjoys eating paper-based food.]\nRecording Log:\n[Discovered and made contact with a special variant Paperman; intimacy requirement met. Catalog Experience +352!]\n[Subsequently, for each day spent with it, Catalog Experience +5! Each day spent together offers a chance to discover the reason for the special mutation. Alternatively, a certain amount of this Catalog’s Experience can be consumed to analyze the reason for the mutation.]\n[Obtain Catalog Experience daily based on the number of creatures of this type cohabited with, their Level, and by enhancing the abilities of creatures whose intimacy meets the standard. This also serves to complete the Catalog and raise its Level.]\nLooking at this Catalog entry for the Paperman, Su Ping’s brow furrowed slightly.\nHe looked again at the little Paperman before him.\nIn fact, he wasn’t the least bit interested in the reasons for the little Paperman’s mutation. Because Su Ping knew that, compared to Xiao Qing, the reasons for the little Paperman’s mutation probably weren’t that hard to guess, but they were definitely difficult to replicate! The little Paperman’s mutation was definitely linked in some unimaginable way to that Secret Realm. And who knew if such an opportunity still existed within that Secret Realm! That particular Sword Soul Mark alone was already puzzling enough for him.\nThe reason for his frown was another matter entirely.\nThis Paperman’s Racial Skill... there’s another one? Paper Body Folding allows it to freely transform its body shape; if Su Ping had such a paper Pet Beast, he could even fold it into the shape of a paper airplane. And this Paper Body Joint?\nHis understanding of the Paperman species as Pet Beasts was really not too extensive.\nHowever, the little Paperman’s connection to this Secret Realm had given Su Ping some ideas, and through their interaction over this period, Su Ping had genuinely grown fond of the little Paperman.\nSince that was the case, Su Ping needed to start planning early.\nCompared to the Forest Wolf, Su Ping’s knowledge of the Paperman was far too limited. This wasn’t just in terms of Skill effects and corresponding Cultivation, but more importantly, its potential for future Evolution. In this regard, Su Ping needed to prepare well in advance.\nSpeaking of which, a few days ago, he had asked Sun Chaoju if there was an Intermediate Level Breeder in Linzhou City specializing in Papermen. However, he had been so busy recently with Old Sha’s evolution to the Third Rank that he hadn’t found the time to ask again. He needed to find time to inquire once more, but now was clearly not the right moment.\nCurrently, Old Sha was in the mid-to-late phase of the Third Rank, and Photosynthesis had even advanced to Mastery Level, just one step away from reaching Perfection Level. Once Perfection Level was reached, Old Sha’s energy accumulation would allow it to begin evolving.\nDuring this phase, let alone being distracted by consulting other Breeders about the cultivation and evolution of other Pet Beasts, Su Ping wouldn’t even want to leave Heart of Woods if possible.\nAs it turned out, Su Ping’s perseverance was crucial. After another five full days, he finally perceived, with Old Sha’s feedback, that Photosynthesis had reached the peak of Mastery Level. With just a little more effort, it could cross the threshold into Perfection Level!\nIn other words, Old Sha had reached the point where evolution was imminent!",

      "content": "Chapter 85: Chapter 85 Photosynthesis (Perfection)\nSu Ping’s eyes were bloodshot. Over the past few days, he had slept for less than ten hours in total. Today, he had barely closed his eyes when he was awakened again. Old Sha’s condition became increasingly peculiar as the effectiveness of its Photosynthesis continued to climb. Under such circumstances, even with the recording capabilities of a camera, Su Ping couldn’t fully trust it. This was true even though the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas contained perfect cultivation Secret Techniques and Magic Potion formulas without any flaws.\nBut this was Evolution! And it was a particularly dangerous Evolution, not the kind where one could still be at peace if it failed.\nTherefore, he had to watch it personally, ensuring Old Sha wouldn’t encounter any problems before he could rest assured. This was especially true at this crucial juncture.\nHowever, aside from the first awakening of Photosynthesis, and the two subsequent Level advancements that brought it to the Mastery Level, Old Sha’s Heart of Woods hadn’t experienced any more special changes. This allowed Su Ping to breathe a slight sigh of relief.\nPrevious calculations indicated that the Heart of Woods had indeed formed a very special supply relationship with Photosynthesis and Sunlight Absorption. Based on the experience Su Ping had accumulated these past few days, he suspected some mysterious changes might be hidden within. But at this critical point in the Evolution, he really didn’t want any unexpected problems to emerge.\n\"Old Sha, how do you feel?\"\nSu Ping had spent these past few days with Old Sha under the sunlight, and compared to before, he even seemed slightly darker. However, Su Ping clearly didn’t have the leisure to care about that at this moment.\nA low sound emanated from Old Sha. Its body remained motionless, yet it seemed as if countless mouths all over it were constantly breathing. At the same time, its originally cyan fur seemed to be shifting towards Xiao Qing’s coloration. Over these past few days, its fur had gained a touch of vibrant green. However, unlike Xiao Qing’s green, which harbored a beautiful but deadly poison, Old Sha’s was entirely like sunlit, brightly shimmering leaves. It radiated an indescribable vitality.\nAlthough, for such plant-like, bursting vitality to appear on a creature like a Forest Wolf was, in itself, quite astonishing.\nOld Sha’s animalistic traits had diminished substantially over the past few days. If Su Ping hadn’t been constantly by its side, it probably wouldn’t even have been able to make a sound in response. Because ’plants’ do not make sounds. Only Su Ping, its ever-present master, could restore its animalistic vitality.\nThis was what Su Ping cared about most. He certainly wanted to help Old Sha evolve, become stronger, and extend its lifespan, but what he wanted was a lively Old Sha, not a wolf-shaped wooden wolf.\nSensing Old Sha’s feedback, Su Ping let out a slight breath. He could wait no longer. This period had been one of the most torturous in his life. After all, Old Sha was not like his own Soul Contract Pet Beast in the Beast Taming Space, whose condition and state he could sense at any moment through their Soul Contract. The situation had him eating poorly and sleeping restlessly.\nEven without Old Sha’s feedback, Su Ping was ready to try.Googlᴇ search No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nSo, he slowly took out an item.\nEven under the bright daylight, this object still emanated an unparalleled brilliance, instantly capturing Old Sha’s full attention. A call from deep within its bloodline made Old Sha feel an indescribable longing! It wanted this object!\nIt was none other than the Sun Crystal.\nThe Sun Crystal, of course, wasn’t a fragment split from the sun hanging high above. If that were the case, forget Monarch Level beings, even Emperor Level ones would likely be overwhelmed. The Sun Crystal was formed from transformed Earth Element that, after prolonged exposure to abundant sunlight, had absorbed a massive amount of solar energy. It was also the most precious of the materials currently in Su Ping’s possession.\nThis item, worth tens of millions, perhaps even several tens of millions, was nevertheless casually extended by Su Ping and offered to Old Sha’s mouth. In Su Ping’s heart, anything that could be measured by money and value couldn’t compare to family like Old Sha. This naturally included a mere Monarch Level resource.\nLooking at the Sun Crystal brought to its mouth, Old Sha, if this were before, would definitely have wondered how to eat such a glowing clod of earth, and if it was even edible. Now, however, with Photosynthesis continuously working inside its body, Old Sha’s craving for the Sun Crystal was extremely urgent. Without a second thought, it snapped the crystal into its mouth.\nCRUNCH! CRUNCH!\nThe crisp chewing sounds echoed as light spilled from the gaps in Old Sha’s great maw, which had not opened to eat for several days.\nThe scene was extremely eerie, yet Su Ping watched with utmost seriousness. His mental focus sharpened intensely at this moment. If Old Sha couldn’t use the Sun Crystal to elevate its Photosynthesis Level and break through this final bottleneck, then this third stage of Evolution might indeed take some unpredictable turns.\nAt this thought, Su Ping’s heart grew even more anxious. The past few days of agonizing waiting—days spent almost inseparably accompanying Old Sha as it sunbathed and ate sunflower seeds. Later, when Old Sha slowed its eating, Su Ping had even peeled the seeds for it, soaked them in sunlit spring water, and wiped its body.\nNow, it was finally time to see the results.\nCRACK. CRACK.\nAfter the last few hard chunks of the Sun Crystal were finally crushed by Old Sha with these crisp sounds, accompanied by a clear GULP, it swallowed them down.\nThe glow in Old Sha’s mouth vanished. In its place, its eyes closed.\nThen, the next moment, a glimmer of light began to steadily ascend. After repeatedly absorbing countless rays of sunlight, it finally reached a pinnacle!\nSu Ping sensed that although Old Sha’s mouth and nose were still, it was as if a gigantic vacuum pump was continuously breathing, purifying the world’s oxygen and spiritual energy!\nAnd the next moment, this radiance from Old Sha suddenly spread out. Countless misty points of light surfaced around its body.\nMerely standing next to Old Sha, Su Ping felt as if he were in the purest natural forest oxygen bar; the refreshing sensation with every breath was so invigorating that he momentarily couldn’t react.\nHowever, Su Ping knew that in less than ten days, Old Sha had acquired a second Perfection Level Skill!\nHis gaze locked onto:\n[Photosynthesis (Perfection)]",

      "content": "Chapter 86: Chapter 86: Is Su Anyong Coming Back?\nIt was as if his tumultuous emotions had suddenly peaked, and at last, at this moment, they calmly landed.\nSu Ping let out a long breath and, without a second thought, lay back on the grass beside Old Sha.\nPerfection!\nAs long as Photosynthesis reached the Perfection Level, one could boldly proclaim:\nBasically secure!\nThis was truly stable.\nThe most arduous and critical third stage of evolution for the Wanmu Wolf, perfected by the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, was finally complete!\nNext, once Old Sha’s accumulated energy peaked and his condition was fully restored, he could begin the evolution, a unique stage in the Beast Taming society of Blue Star.\nAt this stage, there was no longer a need to live in fear and trepidation.\nAfter all, Su Ping had absolute faith in the perfecting effects of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas.\nThus, the string that had been taut in his heart these past days suddenly relaxed. Although immense excitement still enveloped his heart, in this sun-drenched, warm season, lying on the soft grass, Su Ping completely let go and actually dozed off into a deep sleep.\nHe had a dream.\nHe dreamt that he was at the center of a radiant light.\nAnd by his side, there were countless Forest Wolves and other various Pet Beasts.\nLike a tide.\nThose flying in the sky, swimming in the sea, running on the ground.\nEven beyond these Pet Beasts, there were many more, of types he couldn’t clearly make out, all surrounding him.\nAnd Old Sha was among them.\nExcept Old Sha had transformed into another appearance.\nSu Ping couldn’t describe that appearance. Like most people’s dreams, he knew it was Old Sha, but he just couldn’t remember the specific scenes in the dream.\nSu Ping only knew this was the most comfortable sleep he had ever had, and the most beautiful dream.\nUnfortunately, at the end of the dream, some not-so-good images suddenly appeared.\n\"I don’t want to! I don’t want to be a live-in son-in-law! I’m already a Breeding Master! I’m the strongest Beast Tamer...\"\nSu Ping suddenly opened his eyes, thrashing about in an attempt to stop the beautiful dream from turning into a nightmare.\nHe looked around, his bewildered gaze slowly returning to reality as he took in his surroundings.\nThe sky had already grown dim, and on the other side, a crescent moon was even making its appearance.\nThe confused Su Ping glanced around and realized that beside him, other than Old Sha, there was also a concerned Uncle Guan.\nSeeing Su Ping waking up, although his last words in the dream had left Guan Qianshan with a strange expression, Uncle Guan himself clearly heaved a sigh of relief.\n\"You gave me a scare! I was about to carry you inside to sleep, but this Forest Wolf stopped me. Xiao Ping, have you been too tired these days? Take a good rest; cultivating Pet Beasts isn’t an overnight task.\"\nSu Ping smiled and looked at Old Sha, then faced Uncle Guan’s concerned gaze before replying, \"No worries, things are stable now. There’s no need to be so busy.\"\nHe rubbed Old Sha’s furry head and was suddenly startled.\nThe touch of his hand was no longer the soft yet coarse wolf’s hair but felt more like the branches and leaves of trees.\nThis unique and bizarre sensation momentarily left him without a reaction.\nHowever, Su Ping understood that this was a sign Old Sha’s changes were already beginning.\nIn other words, Old Sha’s evolution had actually started.\nHis days of toil had not been in vain.\nSu Ping breathed a sigh of relief and stood up with a smile. \"Don’t worry, I’m fine now. By the way, Uncle Guan, have you made dinner? I’m hungry!\"\nLao Guan looked helplessly at the young man, then replied, \"It’s ready; we’ve been waiting for you. Come on, you’re completely different from your father in character! I really don’t know who you take after.\"\nFollowing the chattering Lao Guan into the kitchen, Lao Guan put on an apron before taking out the food that had been kept warm.\nImpressively, four dishes and a soup made Su Ping’s eyes light up, and then he began to devour it.\nWatching Su Ping eat as if he were a reincarnated starving ghost, Guan Qianshan smiled with satisfaction.\n\"You haven’t eaten well these past few days, so don’t eat too fast. Binge eating is bad for your health.\"\n\"I never realized, Uncle Guan, your cooking skills are this impressive?\"\nAt this, Lao Guan chuckled and said, \"Impressive? That’s because you haven’t seen the cooking skills of my wife and daughter.\"\nSu Ping raised his eyebrows; he hardly ever heard Lao Guan mention his family matters.\n\"How old is your daughter? You’ve never mentioned her before?\"\n\"She’s about the same age as you, but she previously studied at the Second Middle School.\"\n\"Oh? So she’s a graduate this year, too? Has she chosen her Pet Beast yet?\"\nSu Ping blinked.\nLao Guan shook his head. \"The girl is sensible; she always said she’d be fine with just contracting any random one, but I’ve been thinking of giving her a surprise. I’ve been telling her not to rush into a contract, wanting to buy her a good one when the time comes.\"\nAt this, Lao Guan looked at Su Ping expectantly. \"Xiao Ping, you have a lot of insight into this area. Do you have any recommendations?\"\nSu Ping thought for a moment and said, \"What is her talent?\"\n\"Uh... the common talent, Telepathic Communication.\"\nSu Ping nodded. In fact, he didn’t really recommend Pet Beasts with high-level Racial Potential because they were too expensive. Of course, evolving low-level Pet Beasts was not only expensive but also difficult. So, just as Uncle Guan and Zhou Shuchen believed, starting with Pet Beasts that had a sufficiently high initial Racial Potential Level was definitely better.\nIf it were someone else, Su Ping might have casually recommended a few, but Uncle Guan was different. After some thought, he said, \"Uncle Guan, why not the Forest Wolf? When the time comes, I can help with its training and even evolution!\"\n\"This... would that be too much trouble for you!?\"\nGuan Qianshan was somewhat embarrassed.\n\"No problem, it’s not a bother. Just consider it a bonus for all the help you give me around here!\"\nBenefit bonus?\nGuan Qianshan was somewhat astonished. He knew that in the past couple of days, a single application of Cultivation Skills had generated an income of five million gold. Although he was aware that this was profit, not principal, it was more than enough.\nHe wanted to refuse, but he couldn’t bring himself to do so. After all, it wasn’t for him but for his child’s future prospects.\nSu Ping smiled and didn’t say much more.\n\"I truly never expected that after you took over Heart of Woods, you could achieve such feats. You’re much stronger than your father was back then. He used to ask me to look after you, but now it seems like it’s completely you, kid, who’s looking after me!\"\nGuan Qianshan was somewhat sentimental.\n\"By the way, Uncle Guan, do you know what my dad is doing in Northern Cold?\"\nSu Ping found it hard to believe that Su Anyong had actually gone to find him a stepmother.\nHis old man, though unreliable, surely wasn’t *that* unreliable?\nGuan Qianshan shook his head. \"You know what your dad is like; he probably just up and left on a whim.\"\nSu Ping thought for a moment and nodded.\nTrue enough.\nHowever, at this very moment, a crisp notification sound came from his phone.\nSu Ping tapped it open and saw a message on the screen.\nThe sender of this message was none other than his own father, whom he and Guan Qianshan had just mentioned.Thɪs Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\nAnd the content of the message made Su Ping pause in surprise:\n[Su Anyong: Son, my business here is almost wrapped up, and your dad might be coming back in a few days. Miss me?]\nSu Ping blinked.",

      "content": "Chapter 87: Chapter 87: The Unachievable Evolution of Wanmu Wolf?\n「Beast Master Association.」\nIn the chairman’s office at the very top, two familiar figures sat opposite each other, the office filled with the fragrance of tea.\nVice President Liu savored a sip of the Spirit-Old Tea. His lips pursed slightly, his mouth immediately began to water, and he couldn’t help but exclaim, \"No wonder Su Ping said my Snow Crest with Emerald couldn’t compare to this Spirit-Old Tea. It’s indeed true!\"\nQin Erlong looked somewhat pained. \"This is the only pot; there’s no more. It’s only because you brought that boy out that I’m even sharing this. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have gotten a sniff.\"\nVice President Liu wasn’t angered by this. He simply closed his eyes and savored a few more sips.\nSeeing his enjoyment, Qin Erlong finally asked, \"Speaking of which, how has that young man been doing lately?\"\nVice President Liu opened his eyes. \"How else could he be? He’s a promising talent. After class that day, Xiao Sun and the others wanted to take him out to fool around, but he refused them. His character is commendable.\"\nIf Su Ping heard this at this moment, he would certainly curse Sun Chaoju outright for being an old rat.\nOld Qin also smiled and nodded. \"Indeed, he’s impressive. So young, yet so devoted to the Beast Cultivation career and even able to resist various temptations—very promising! My granddaughter’s painstaking efforts weren’t wasted.\"\nHowever, when Vice President Liu didn’t react to his cheerful expression, Qin Erlong continued, \"How is the evolution of the Wanmu Wolf coming along?\"ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nVice President Liu then adopted a serious expression. \"It’s quite good. Unfortunately, the success rate isn’t high.\"\n\"Oh, why’s that? Even you can’t manage it?\" Qin Erlong perked up with interest. Evidently, after Sun Chaoju lost the Wanmu Wolf evolution method to Su Ping in a bet, he had given another copy to his own teacher. The reasoning was simple: if it could be researched successfully, Sun Chaoju, as the discoverer of this evolutionary path, would naturally gain immense benefits and fame.\nVice President Liu shook his head. \"It’s not that it’s impossible, but it’s difficult to explain. The Wanmu Wolf evolution extends and expands the Forest Wolf’s Wood Attribute even further! Moreover, unlike the Crown Wolf Emperor, which controls Wood Attribute forces, the Wanmu Wolf, while also capable of controlling Wood Attribute power, primarily focuses on absorbing the essence of wood into its own body. This characteristic is wonderfully similar to how trees and other woody plants function. Therefore, after Xiao Sun completes an evolution, the resulting Wanmu Wolves all adopt that particular form. To fully master this evolution, the Wanmu Wolf must pass through an extremely special and delicate stage, one that requires numerous attempts. Furthermore, the potential of this Evolutionary Body is currently unknown. And if this evolution fails at any point after entering the evolutionary phase, the mortality rate is one hundred percent...\"\nAs Vice President Liu elaborated, Qin Erlong’s frown deepened. Finally, he glared at Liu Fuhai. \"You didn’t tell Little Su about this beforehand? What were you thinking?\"\nVice President Liu also glared. \"What should I have said? That the evolution for Little Su is too difficult, that even I would need to prepare meticulously if I wanted to try? That he should just forget it? If I put it that way, wouldn’t the kid just get more fired up? You bastard! I haven’t settled the score with you for last time! Your own granddaughter went to do the cultivation, and you damn well didn’t explain it to me clearly! You had Miss Qin come over to call me to account, and I, at my age, had to put on a smiling face for your granddaughter? Now you want to pick a fight with me over this kid’s business too? Qin Erlong, don’t think I’m scared of you now just because you found yourself a fierce wife!\"\nSeeing Old Liu flare up, Qin Erlong immediately softened and chuckled. \"It’s only because it’s you, Old Liu. If Zuo Guang came here and dared to talk to me like that, I’d show him what’s what.\"\nNoticing Old Liu had fallen silent, Qin Erlong quickly picked up the teapot, poured him another cup, and changed the subject. \"Speaking of which, how come Zuo Guang has been in the Imperial Capital for so long and still hasn’t returned? Is he playing lapdog for headquarters again?\"\n\"Your words don’t have to be so harsh. Old Zuo isn’t having an easy time either. Jianghai Province hasn’t produced any significant achievements in a long time, so it’s understandable he feels he’s lost face at headquarters.\"\n\"Results? What counts as results? It’s only in recent years, after the Holy Dragon took charge and significantly increased supervision, that things have changed. Otherwise, how much of the top-to-bottom resource allocation actually reached the hands of Research Breeders? Zuo Guang used to turn a blind eye to it all. If it weren’t for some old ties, he would have been guilty of connivance and sheltering. But now, it’s alright. He knows when to step back, is ready to retire, and has handed most of the association’s major affairs over to you. But the Breeders with Talent from back then have all left for other regions. How many are still in Jianghai? It’d be a wonder if they could produce any results.\" Qin Erlong sounded extremely dismissive, apparently holding the actual president of the Jianghai Province Breeder Association in no regard whatsoever.\nVice President Liu, however, merely smiled and didn’t pursue the topic. Generally, while the Beast Master Association did wield the most local power, the Breeder Association had different functions, making extensive involvement often inappropriate.\nAfter a pause, Old Liu changed the subject. \"So, that’s why I’m hoping that young man might create a miracle, isn’t it? If he can successfully develop the Wanmu Wolf’s evolution, then, setting aside everything else, Jianghai Province should at least make a respectable showing at the year-end Breeder Contest, don’t you think? Even if it’s an Advanced Level evolution for the Forest Wolf, considering the difficulty, it might not win us first place if it can’t be widely adopted. But at least Jianghai Province wouldn’t be so utterly disgraced, right?\"\nQin Erlong was about to scoff, but then his eyes suddenly lit up. \"In that case, shouldn’t the Breeder Association also provide strong sponsorship and support for the resources Su Ping needs for his evolution experiments?\"\nVice President Liu was taken aback and shot the old scoundrel a speechless glance. \"No wonder you managed to pursue her back then; you really do have thick skin. But rest assured, Little Su asked for a Sun Crystal a few days ago. I reckon that’s what he mainly needs, and I’ve managed to allocate a few more these past few days.\"\n\"That’s more like it! But it’s not enough. I heard Little Su wanted to buy some equipment. As the president of the Breeder Association, one must vigorously support promising new Breeders, don’t hold back...\"\nVice President Liu immediately stood up. \"I knew your tea wasn’t offered for free! I’m leaving. If I stay any longer, you old fox will fleece me for sure!\"\nQin Erlong didn’t try to stop him. Ultimately, however, neither of them held out much hope. Even Liu Fuhai, a man who was not only the Vice President of the Breeder Association but also a Breeder specializing in Advanced Level Wolf Pets, had stated the evolution was extremely difficult. Therefore, even if Su Ping could complete it, it certainly wouldn’t be achievable in a short period.\nHowever, what neither of them could have imagined was that on this very ordinary day, the evolution of the Wanmu Wolf—the one they believed couldn’t be developed in a short time—had already begun.",

      "content": "Chapter 88: Chapter 88: Old Sha Evolves!\nSu Ping was clearly still unaware. For the sake of Old Sha’s evolution into the Wanmu Wolf, Qin Erlong had, on his behalf, once again squeezed Old Liu for a hefty sum of resources, which was now waiting for Su Ping to collect and approve. Right now, he didn’t have the mind to deal with such matters.\nUpon hearing that his dad would be back in a few days, Su Ping suddenly felt his spirits lift. Su Ping knew that although his dad often seemed unreliable, his affection for Old Sha was definitely no less than Su Ping’s own—perhaps even deeper. After all, his dad and Old Sha had practically grown up together. Otherwise, why would his dad, who usually paid little attention to the Heart of Woods base, have even attempted to help Old Sha evolve?\nTherefore, Su Ping resolved that before his dad returned...\nOld Sha must complete its evolution!\nIndeed, this was the case. Over the past few days, all the money earned from completed cultivation orders at the Heart of Woods had been spent. If Su Ping hadn’t just finished cultivating a batch of pre-ordered Forest Wolves, his funds would have truly been insufficient. However, the results were excellent. He had used all that money to purchase Commander Level Wood Element resources, then had Old Sha consume them all at once.\nEvolution requires an accumulation of surplus energy to be completed in a single, powerful burst! Older Pet Beasts find it difficult to evolve precisely because their vitality declines with age, making it hard for them to maintain a surplus of energy for extended periods. Under such circumstances, evolution naturally becomes extremely difficult. Fortunately, because Old Sha had previously ingested the Heart of Woods, it had serendipitously undergone a rank-up. This extended its lifespan and slowed the decline of its vitality. This all led to the scene today.\nThe sunlight shone brightly. In this post-September weather, it seemed as if even the heavens sensed Su Ping’s fervent hope, granting a rare succession of bright, sunny days. Today was especially radiant. This day was a very special one. Its significance was almost on par with the first time Su Ping had fed the Heart of Woods to Old Sha.\nConsequently, on this day, none of the Forest Wolves trained as usual. Including Xiao Qing, all the Forest Wolves squatted patiently around the perimeter of an area that, for the past half-month, had been strictly forbidden for any person or Forest Wolf to approach. They stared intently at the center of the area, their eyes filled with excitement, anticipation, and a touch of yearning. And in the very center of this restricted ground stood Su Ping and Old Sha.\nOld Sha at this moment was entirely different from half a month ago! Its originally dark cyan fur had become even more vibrant and green, yet its texture was unlike the fur of ordinary Wolf Pets. At first glance, it looked more like the cellular structure of leaves than fur. Along Old Sha’s spine, several even longer and narrower tufts of fur grew like spreading tree branches, giving it an indescribably peculiar appearance.\nOld Sha’s eyes were closed, its body bathed in sunlight. Strands of green vitality swirled around it, and it almost seemed as if rhythmic breathing sounds emanated from Old Sha’s body. Its photosynthetic output, from just one wolf, seemed comparable to that of a small forest.\nPerfection Level Photosynthesis!\nIf this Skill were on a Low-level Luozisong (Pine), it could probably enable it to break through several Realms in a short period. However, for a Forest Wolf, this Skill formed an exceptionally strange synergy with Sunlight Absorption. It wasn’t very distinct under the sunlight, but one could still sense a faint Light Cocoon forming around Old Sha. This Light Cocoon wasn’t thick, nor could it completely envelop Old Sha yet.\nSo, in front of Old Sha, there was one last thing. For Old Sha’s evolution this time, Su Ping had truly spared no expense. Perhaps it was because Old Sha’s Sunlight Absorption and Photosynthesis had both reached the Perfection Level, or perhaps for some other reason, but the final energy accumulation Old Sha required was slightly more than what Sun Chaoju had noted in his records. Su Ping had purchased three such Commander Level Wood Element resources, and now only the last one remained.\nIt was a leaf, only the size of a palm, yet it was the most expensive of the three Commander Level resources: Elf Leaves. A precious resource containing both Wood Element and Life Series powers, it had a significant boosting effect for such Pet Beasts. It was also the final trump card to help Old Sha accelerate its energy accumulation!\nSensing, perhaps, that its brewing energy was still somewhat insufficient, Old Sha slowly opened its eyes. In its eyes, there was joy, anticipation, and also fear.\nIt was joyful that it could, one day, still feel the Light of Evolution shining upon it.\nIt also anticipated its young master’s miraculous abilities, which it had witnessed before, hoping its young master could replicate that miracle this time.\nYet, at the same time, it was terrified. Even with all its young master had done, what if the evolution still failed?\nIt didn’t care about its own life or death. But it had consumed so many of its young master’s resources, so much of his effort; if it still failed, what then?\nThus, without even waiting for Su Ping to speak, its tongue—which seemed to bear the patterns of tree leaves—stretched out and lapped the life-infused Elf Leaves into its mouth. Su Ping understood its urgency. After it took the Elf Leaves into its mouth, Su Ping gently placed his palm on Old Sha’s head and said softly, \"Old Sha, I believe in you. You have to believe in me too!\"\nNo sound came from Old Sha. However, its gaze, fixed on Su Ping, was incredibly resolute as it looked at its young master. At that moment, its eyes seemed to convey all its conviction.\nOf course, it believed!\nIt wanted to raise its neck. From its body, now gradually losing sensation, it yearned to let out a familiar howl towards the sky—a howl unheard for many long days. In this final, fate-deciding moment, it wanted to tell its young master that it absolutely, unequivocally believed in his capabilities!\nBut in the very next instant, Old Sha’s final gaze, its sparkling eyes, suddenly turned dull and vacant, as if they had transformed into plant matter itself. This was because the initially faint Light Cocoon, the Light of Evolution, had suddenly become incredibly thick the moment the Elf Leaves were swallowed. From head to toe, the Light Cocoon slowly enveloped Old Sha, which seemed rooted to the earth, covering everything except its head. The energy accumulation, with the help of the Elf Leaves, had finally reached Perfection!\nHowever, just as this Light of Evolution was about to completely engulf it, from its proudly raised neck, from within its seemingly insensate body, and with every last ounce of its waning strength, a howl unlike any before—a howl born of Old Sha’s final, desperate effort—resounded through the sky above the Heart of Woods.Google seaʀᴄh\nAWOOO...\nHowever, this all-out Wolf Howl lasted less than a second. The very next second, the thick Light Cocoon of evolution completely enveloped Old Sha.\nSu Ping, however, smiled faintly. He had heard Old Sha’s response and understood its unspoken meaning. That meaning was simple: ’Not only does it believe in its young master, but it also trusts that the young master will become the greatest Beast Tamer and Breeder in the future.’",

They mentioned before that they wanted to have a personal chat with you...\"\nIn the walkie-talkie, Lao Guan’s voice came through. Su Ping’s brow furrowed.\n\"Uncle Guan, I don’t have time right now. You attend to them first. If they aren’t willing to wait, we’ll reschedule.\"\nSu Ping’s gaze didn’t shift, remaining firmly fixed on the enormous Light Cocoon.\nThe Light of Evolution is a special phenomenon that only appears during a Pet Beast’s Evolution.\nIt is the time when a Pet Beast is at its most vulnerable, and any accident can easily lead to a failed Evolution due to external factors.\nEven though this was his own home, Su Ping was unwilling to move even half a step during these final moments.\nThe duration of the Evolution depends on the strength of the Evolutionary Body.\nHowever, under normal conditions, the process doesn’t actually take too long.\nSu Ping estimated that forty minutes to an hour and a half should be sufficient.\nAfter all, Evolution is a metamorphosis that occurs once all Energy prerequisites reach their peak.\nCompared to this final Evolution, the Cultivation that came before was considerably longer and more arduous.\nFortunately, regardless, Su Ping had already completed the journey and reached this final step.\nDuring these last moments, he certainly wouldn’t leave to attend to any customer, thereby missing the final second of Old Sha’s transformation.\nNever mind mere customers; even if President Qin or Vice President Liu showed up, they would have to wait patiently. Of course, Su Ping estimated that if these two knew, they’d probably be quite willing to wait with him, right?\nSu Ping directly cut off the signal. In the reception room, Lao Guan was left somewhat embarrassed. However, he still returned to the room and apologetically addressed the three figures on the sofa,\n\"Gentlemen, I apologize. Our boss is currently unavailable. However, here at Heart of Woods, we take the Cultivation of every Pet Beast very seriously. It’s personally overseen by Breeder Su himself, ensuring there are no issues whatsoever! Furthermore, our prices have always been consistent, with absolutely no hidden charges!\"\nIf Su Ping were here, he’d probably recognize at first glance who these individuals claiming to know him were.\nThe two young figures sitting to the left and right were none other than the Zhang Wen and Zhang Wu brothers, whom he had met earlier at Yuntian Resort.\nThese were the brothers with the Talented Ability of telepathic connection.\nHowever, upon hearing the Cultivation price of four million, or a one million material fee in the event of failure, they had decided to return home to discuss it. After finally making a decision and bringing their father—who seldom came home—they heard another piece of news.\nThe Cultivation fee at Heart of Woods had increased again, to five million, which undoubtedly left the two brothers stunned.\nWhen Lao Guan learned of this, he also felt somewhat helpless.\nAt that time, Su Ping had a somewhat unclear understanding of his own Cultivation services and hadn’t anticipated so many customers. That was why price changes had occurred twice in rapid succession during that period.\nNow that people were literally at his doorstep, what could he do? Could he decide on his own to lock in the Cultivation fee at four million for the two? This deal involved a two million difference; how could he possibly make that decision?\nBut to Guan Qianshan’s relief, the burly man sitting between the two young men didn’t seem angered by this. Instead, he appeared quite interested in examining the Heart of Woods reception room.\nHe didn’t seem to care at all about the heated haggling between his sons and Manager Guan.\nIn fact, he really didn’t care.\nAlthough ten million was a sum he could ill afford, this time he had come with a special mission.\nHis name was Zhang Lie, and his identity was quite special.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt\nAs one of the core cities in the east and an important city by the Eastern Sea, Jianghai Province naturally held a special status.\nAccordingly, there were Beast Tamer Legions stationed in Jianghai Province.\nHowever, the location of the Beast Tamer Legions’ military district was generally not disclosed to the public.\nZhang Lie was the commander of the Forest Wolf Troop, a unit within the Jianghai Province Legion, specifically from the Forest Wild Army’s War Wolf A Division.\nOwing to its strategic position, the Beast Tamer Legions in Jianghai Province encompassed several army Legions.\nApart from two army Legions, the rest were naval forces and a portion of the air force.\nAfter all, the location of West Dragon Lake was exceptionally advantageous.\nNot only in Jianghai Province, but many water-type Beast Tamer Legions from the Eastern Military Region also operated around West Dragon Lake.\nIn this era, the primary tasks of the Beast Tamer Legions, besides driving away wild Pet Beasts that entered human-activity zones, were internal exercises and training.\nJust last month, his Forest Wolf Troop had a simulated battle exercise with a brother troop from the Fierce Tiger C Division.\nThe result was a devastating loss: the opponent achieved victory with less than one-third of their own casualties, not only routing his forces but also capturing him, the commander, before he could even summon his Pet Beasts.\nWhat was most embarrassing was that the exercise took place in a forest—terrain where his Forest Wolf Troop should have excelled.\nEven now, Zhang Lie could still envisage the dark-faced expression of his superior officer.\nNevertheless, he understood why the opponent was so formidable.\nThe reason was simple: the Fierce Tiger C Division had undergone internal reforms, and that Rock Tiger Troop was the first to be affected. This exercise was intended to test the results using his Forest Wolf Troop.\nThe focus of this internal reform was elite Cultivation.\nThis involved specialized training programs, Skill Cultivation by professional Breeders, resource rewards for completing training objectives, and even Evolution.\nHaving learned all this, Zhang Lie had accepted this mission as a chance for redemption: find a suitable Forest Wolf Breeder and implement enhanced Cultivation and training for his own troop!\nAnd just after he left the Legion base and returned home, his two sons informed him that in Linzhou, they had come across an interesting Forest Wolf Breeder who was actually capable of nurturing the Heart of Woods Skill!\nIndeed, although the Beast Tamer Legions were separate institutions within the Dragon Nation and, serving as a national mainstay, had access to comprehensive resources and training, there was a certain rigidity within the Legions. The breeding departments within the Legions did exist, but they were, for the most part, outdated. After all, most geniuses with a Talent for breeding would not choose a military career. It was about time to appropriately introduce the diverse breeding methods from the outside world into the Legions to further enhance the battle strength of the Beast Tamer Legions.\nZhang Lie himself was not too convinced that a young fellow, about the same age as his two naive sons, could be such an impressive Breeder. But, acting on the principle of trying anything in a desperate situation, he came anyway. If he failed to complete this mission, as the commander of the Forest Wolf Troop, there was a high likelihood he would be demoted by his furious superiors to shoveling manure upon his return.\nWith this in mind, Zhang Lie dared not be careless. He smiled at the somewhat embarrassed Manager Guan and said,\n\"Manager Guan, could we take a look inside? As you know, nurturing a Pet Beast is no trivial matter!\"\n\"Of course, this way, please. I expect our Breeder Su is currently researching Pet Beast Cultivation. Perhaps we’ll encounter him,\" replied Manager Guan.\nWith that, the four of them quickly made their way towards the Pet Beast Cultivation area in the backyard.",

      "content": "Chapter 90: Chapter 90: Evolution Successful, What Kind of Evolutionary Being Is This?\n\"Gentlemen, this is where our Heart of Woods Forest Wolves engage in activities and training...\" Guan Qianshan was familiarly introducing the training ground to the father and his sons, but his words came to an abrupt halt halfway through.\n\"Manager Guan, your Forest Wolves...\" Zhang Lie also spoke with evident interest.\nBecause at that moment, behind Guan Qianshan, there was not a trace of any Forest Wolf. On the large clearing in front of the forest, though, there were some remnants of vine markings and signs of battle. It was clear that Lao Guan hadn’t been wrong.\nGuan Qianshan looked rather embarrassed as he glanced back, \"Maybe it’s just not training time yet. The Pet Beast training is mainly handled by Breeder Su.\"\nZhang Lie nodded, not saying a word, feeling a bit disappointed. It was almost eleven o’clock now. As the leader of the Forest Wolf Troop, he naturally knew that unlike other wolves that are nocturnal, daytime was the best time for Forest Wolves to train and be active. Yet now, there was no sign of these Forest Wolves, nor any trace of that so-called Breeder; it clearly showed a lack of dedication. Although I anticipated this possibility, I can’t help feeling somewhat let down. It seems I might have to look for another Breeder after all.\nBut while he thought this, no other emotion showed on his face.\nAs for Lao Guan, he had completely given up. He didn’t even know what their young boss had been up to these past few days. Why was Su Ping staying so dedicatedly by that strange Forest Wolf, even halting the purchase of surrounding land deeds? All the money had been spent on resources for that Forest Wolf! It looked like this business deal was probably not going to happen.\nHowever, driven by professional ethics, he still took the father and sons for an additional tour within the Heart of Woods. \"Just ahead is the research project that Breeder Su has been studying these days, which is generally not open for casual visits. But since you gentlemen were acquainted with Breeder Su before, we can take a distant look from here, and that would be permissible.\"\n\"Hmm!\" Zhang Lie nodded indifferently.\nSeeing his two equally frustrated sons, he chuckled. His sons had always wanted to join the army with him and be part of the Forest Wolf Troop, so they had been training diligently. Now, they were excited to meet the reputable Breeder their father had recommended, and yet, they had encountered this situation.\nFirst, the previously discussed price was off the table; it had suddenly risen by a million. Then, within the entire Heart of Wood Cultivation Base, not a single person could be found. Only this manager, who seemed to have materialized out of thin air, remained. This performance undoubtedly made his sons feel as though they had lost face in front of their own father.\nTherefore, Zhang Lie, who was a stern figure in front of the new recruits and his subordinates, was quite an understanding and gentle father to his sons. Smiling, he said, \"I trust your judgment. When that Little Breeder has time, you can visit and have a chat with him. If the price is the same as before, I’ll do whatever it takes to help you try!\"\nZhang Wen frowned, \"Forget it, who knows if it would even be successful!\"\nManager Guan also felt somewhat helpless. However, he still wore an enthusiastic smile on his face as he approached the tempered glass enclosure, \"This is the main research and Cultivation project that Breeder Su has been focusing on recently...\"\nBefore he could finish, he saw the three individuals, who had just shown signs of boredom, focusing their gaze in unison toward the distance. Guan Qianshan also turned his head in surprise.\nImmediately, at the edge of his vision, under the grass bathed in sunlight, all the Forest Wolves that had just disappeared were now gathered here. Squatting there, one by one, both large and small, there must have been dozens of them. At first glance, they looked like a collection of elementary school students dutifully listening to a lecture.\nZhang Lie witnessed this scene, and it strongly reminded him of small gatherings within his Legion, with every Beast Tamer warrior squatting down in a similar manner. Suddenly, his impression of the young Breeder Su started to change slightly.\nTo be able to tame so many wolves and keep them so well-behaved... he must have some skill, right? Could it be that I was mistaken? And what is that young Breeder having so many Forest Wolves do, squatting here? What’s he up to?\nNew ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nHe moved forward a few steps and came to stand in front of the reinforced glass enclosure, squinting his eyes slightly. Then, those narrowed eyes began to gradually widen until, at last, they were as round as copper bells, staring in disbelief at those two blurred figures at the end of his line of sight, and at that one rare, yet captivating ray of light.\nIt was the light that every Beast Tamer, and countless Pet Beasts, most eagerly anticipated. This light signified a further step in progress, a vaster future, and greater strength, as well as an evolved Pet Beast that was different from the past! Every newly evolved Pet Beast came with a new species name, more Skills, and powerful Racial Potential.\nEven within his own Legion, there were still few soldiers who had accumulated enough military merit to allow their little companions to achieve a satisfactory Evolution, himself included. Even though he, Commander Zhang Lie, was already at the Commander Level of Beast Tamers, his Pet Beast, the Forest Wolf, was still stuck at its race limit. It hadn’t undergone Evolution, not for lack of military merit, but because he hadn’t found a desirable evolutionary path.\nYet, what am I seeing? Inside the Cultivation Base of a Breeder said to be my son’s age, I’m seeing the Light of Evolution? This must be the Evolution of a Forest Wolf, right? What will its Evolutionary Body be? The most common, lowest-tier ordinary Forest Wolf, or something else?\nZhang Lie didn’t know. At that moment, however, his gaze was entirely captivated by that light far away at the end of his line of sight, unable to be moved away in the slightest.\nSu Ping was clearly unaware that this final Evolution had unexpectedly attracted two onlookers. But even if he knew, Su Ping wouldn’t be concerned. The Evolution of the Wanmu Wolf would surely be shared and announced in the future. Being seen by others first didn’t really matter. And at that moment, Su Ping clearly had no leisure to think about anything else. All his attention and gaze were focused on that Light Cocoon.\nFinally, time ticked by slowly. The thick Light Cocoon covering Old Sha gradually became thinner. A faint and indescribable fresh scent wafted out, so refreshing that just being near it made one feel clear-headed and invigorated. Afterward, within the remnants of that hazy halo, a Living Being with a still indistinct but unmistakably wolf-like shadow appeared in their line of sight.\nOld Sha, the Evolution was a success!\nHowever, from a distance, Zhang Lie, seeing this figure, revealed confusion in his wide-open eyes,\nWhat kind of Evolutionary Body is this?",

      "content": "Chapter 91: Chapter 91: The Terrifying Potential of the Wanmu Wolf!\nZhang Lie stood at a great distance, observing a silhouette that completely baffled him.\nWhat kind of Evolutionary Body is this?\nHas a Breeder from the outside world made some incredible breakthrough?\nOtherwise, how could it be that he had just emerged from the Legion only to encounter so many mind-boggling events?\nIt was a gigantic figure, especially when compared to a Forest Wolf.\nIts size was immense. When standing erect, its spine was two meters high. Its raised neck and head reached a height of two point six to two point seven meters.\nHowever, this figure was not as heroic or handsome as one might imagine.\nInstead, it exuded an indescribable grace and dignity.\nLong, branch-like fur hung from its back, covering its body.\nIt seemed cloaked in foliage.\nAbove its head, these continuous branch-like growths connected on either side of its ears, forming two actual Y-shaped branches.\nThe branches were a lush green. In contrast to its towering stature, they created an inexplicably cute effect.\nYet, from the green light endlessly emitted by those two horn-like branches and the dispersing natural fluctuations, one could sense their power.\nThese two branches were definitely not just for decoration; they might even be the most important source of power for this Forest Wolf Evolver!\nThe Forest Wolf was a majestic Wolf Pet with azure-colored fur.\nAt this moment, this Evolutionary Body resembled a wolf-shaped hunter, cloaked in what looked like a straw raincoat made of forest foliage.\nFrom a distance, it hardly resembled a wolf. With its long, branch-like hair dragging on the ground and the two Y-shaped branch antlers, it looked more like the legendary Kylin.\nBut anyone with a bit of common sense would obviously know that it couldn’t possibly be a Kylin!\nIt was still just a wolf. A wolf that had never been seen before, never been heard of before!\nZhang Lie pursed his lips; he felt goosebumps rise all over his skin, watching incredulously at the colossal figure and the person in front of it.\nThe surrounding Forest Wolves whined softly, their bodies trembling as if worshiping their king.\nThis was a new Evolutionary Body! At the very least, it was an entirely new Evolutionary Body that he had never heard of before!\nHe just didn’t know if it was developed by that Breeder himself. If so, then it was truly terrifying!\n\"AWOOO...\"\nThis time, the howl was not as loud or piercing, but it was more resonant than any before.\nWithin this somewhat hoarse howl, there was an indescribable and unprecedented excitement.\nIt had actually succeeded in evolving!\nIt could feel the surging power within itself, perceive the brand-new Skills and abilities it possessed. And most importantly, the revitalized vigor in its blood, no trace of the decrepit old age!\nThis sensation, perhaps it had only ever experienced it in dreams before.\nAnd now, the young master before it had turned the dream back into reality!\nIt gazed at Su Ping, and Su Ping looked back at Old Sha.\nThat indescribable life force made every cell in Su Ping’s body seem to cheer.\nUnder such stimulation, even Su Ping’s spiritual power began to ripple.\nHis spiritual power, which already faced no true bottlenecks, broke through once more.\nIt reached the final tier of the Common rank! Common Tenth Level!\nXiao Qing, as its Contracted Beast, was also affected, experiencing an enhancement and reaching Common Ninth Level.\nHowever, Su Ping had no time to focus on these details then; his gaze was fixed intently on Old Sha.\nHe slowly extended his hand, feeling a plant-like roughness on Old Sha’s fur, especially the branch-like hairs cascading from its back.\nHe could sense the surging power within Old Sha, almost spilling out.\nWhat truly allowed him to relax was that Old Sha’s intelligence and personality remained unchanged.\nThe Wanmu Wolf’s Evolution involved too many potential problems and hidden dangers. He had to ensure Old Sha’s safety.\nAnd in the final stage of this Evolution, to prevent Old Sha’s intelligence from becoming ’woody,’ it needed sufficient daily activity and specific training exercises.\nHowever, now was clearly the time to inspect the results.\nThus, with a mental command from Su Ping, the Eye of Truth activated instantly.\nOld Sha, feeling the caress of Su Ping’s hand, naturally didn’t resist Su Ping’s scrutiny.\nInstantly, all of Old Sha’s abilities and changes appeared in Su Ping’s mind:\n[Wanmu Wolf (Wild)]\n[Current Level: Commandant Eighth Rank]\n[Racial Potential: Monarch Ninth Rank]\n[Skills: Sunlight Absorption (Perfection), Photosynthesis (Perfection), Heart of Woods (Proficient), Tree Prison (Proficiency), Mutated Wood Element Body (Beginner), Language of Nature (Proficiency), Life Magnetic Field (Beginner), Wolf King Majesty (Proficiency)]\nCommandant Eighth Rank?! And its Racial Potential has even reached the terrifying Monarch Ninth Rank?\nEven though Su Ping had steeled himself, he still involuntarily held his breath.\nMonarch Level! That was an upper-tier level of the food chain.\nAny Monarch Level Beast Tamer, in any place, would be treated with immense respect.\nThey also constituted a city’s vital high-level strength.\nIf a Beast Tide attacked a city, the local Monarch Level Beast Tamers, like Su Ping’s grandfather Su Zhongguang, would be the primary high-level defense force.\nThe presidents of Beast Master Association branches in most prefecture-level cities were typically individuals at this level.\nAlthough Su Ping himself was still far from Monarch Level, Old Sha’s Evolution, bringing it so close, was undoubtedly a shot of adrenaline for him.\nFrom this day forward, his Heart of Wood Cultivation Base would not be something just anyone could covet. With Old Sha present, even without relying on external influence, the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base now possessed the true power to protect itself!\nMost importantly, he had finally succeeded in extending Old Sha’s lifespan! If it advanced to Monarch Level in the future, its lifespan would be extended even further. Combined with the Wanmu Wolf’s Wood Element Evolution, it seemed Su Ping wouldn’t have to worry about Old Sha’s lifespan dwindling for a very long time.\nThis was the greatest significance and true value of the Evolution for Su Ping.\nNevertheless, Su Ping soon refocused his mind, not withdrawing the gaze of the Eye of Truth.The source of thɪs content is ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nNow, apart from Sunlight Absorption, the Skills developed through later Cultivation, and Wolf King Majesty, all of Old Sha’s other Skills had changed, and new ones had even appeared.\nHe was eager to see the effects and powers of these new Skills.\nHe wanted to further analyze the combat strength of the Wanmu Wolf Evolutionary Body.",

      "content": "Chapter 92: Chapter 92: Arrival of the Tree Realm? Wanmu Wolf Branch Catalog!\nSunlight Absorption, Photosynthesis, and Heart of Woods naturally needed no extra attention.\nHowever, it was still worth mentioning that after this evolution, Old Sha, having evolved into the Wanmu Wolf, had his Heart of Woods advance yet another level.\nIt had reached the Mastery Level directly.\nThis speed of leveling up was clearly far from normal.\nBut now was not the time to delve further into this matter.\nSu Ping didn’t rush. Instead, he focused the Eye of Truth on Old Sha’s first changed Skill, which also seemed to be the primary offensive ability!\n[Tree Prison (Proficient): Can summon multiple rapidly growing trees from the ground, entirely controllable and with all the effects of other woods; additionally, can control all other woods within the Skill’s range!]\nAs expected. This Tree Prison was indeed the evolved form of Vine Strangling. No longer summoning vines, but tangible trees that were bizarrely controllable and had the effects of other woods. The implication was simple. These trees, unlike those vines whose energy dissipated and then died, could retain and exert certain effects. They could even alter the environment of the battlefield. Moreover, with the Heart of Woods, Su Ping conjectured that after using this Skill, the Wanmu Wolf could probably siphon the energy from these trees back through the Heart of Woods! Of course, this was just a thought that would require future training to verify its feasibility.\nHowever, Su Ping had another vague idea. He didn’t know how many trees Old Sha could summon, but what would the effect be when a group of Wanmu Wolves used this Skill simultaneously?\nSu Ping’s eyes lit up at once, invigorated.\nHowever, he didn’t spend more time on this single Skill and continued to the next one:\n[Mutated Wood Form (Beginner): Self divides into animal and plant forms!\nAnimal Form: In wooded areas, with an abundance of Wood Attribute, own strength, speed, and agility significantly increase. Can pass through certain wooded obstacles.\nPlant Form: Transforms into a tree rooted to the ground, immovable yet with significantly increased defensive power; fatal injuries are nullified, Energy and injury recovery are greatly enhanced. Skill effects are increased.]\n[Note: Maintaining the plant form for an extended period greatly affects the vitality of the Wanmu Wolf’s body, with a certain chance of permanent petrification.]\nAt this moment, Su Ping couldn’t help but widen his eyes.\nThis Skill was a true metamorphosis! And worthy of a mutated ability! The different combat modes of plant form and animal form, with the additions to the animal form, would make the Wanmu Wolf an excellent hunter and warrior in the forest. However, the plant form alone, with its nullification of fatal injuries, could be called a Divine Skill; a pity, though, the side effects were indeed too severe, and the Skill would be difficult to train. It served as a life-saving trump card. That was more than enough. Its effects were well-deserving of an Evolutionary Body’s Skills. Although not the legendary Super-Rank Skill, it was much stronger than ordinary abilities.\nShaking his head, Su Ping moved on to the next:\n[Nature’s Language (Proficient): Can accelerate the growth rate of plants and even Plant-based Pet Beasts to a certain extent; can be used on the summoned trees of Tree Prison to enhance their effects, while also condensing the essence of nature to absorb into the body, allowing Tree Prison to undergo certain plant-based changes. After the skill level increases, it has a certain control effect on Plant-based Pet Beasts that are not higher than its own Level!]\nThis Skill was interesting. First of all, this ability was a major boon for plants, even Plant-based Pet Beasts. If it could accelerate the growth of Plant-based Pet Beasts, that would mean accelerating their Level advancement. At the same time, it could reverse the process, absorbing the trees and making the summoned Tree Prison not just ordinary trees, but also those with absorbed essences. This ability had great potential. Moreover, the construction plan for the Heart of Woods benefited greatly from this boost. In order to fully leverage the effects of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, Su Ping planned to focus on cultivating Plant-based Pet Beasts next. With Old Sha’s capability, the effects could be fully realized, making the Cultivation of Plant-based Pet Beasts even more outstanding. Great Skills! An excellent Pet Beast Race must not only possess powerful combat abilities but also learn to provide resources back to its owner. The Wanmu Wolf was exactly such a beast.\nBesides these abilities, there was one final Skill:Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on NovᴇlFirenᴇt\n[Life Magnetic Field (Beginner): Able to apply effects within its own vicinity and the vicinity of the trees it affects, to weaken enemies’ strength, stamina, Life Force, and other such effects.]\nCompared to the other abilities, this Skill wasn’t as eye-catching. It was a standard combat Skill. However, Su Ping also realized that whether it was Nature’s Language or this Life Magnetic Field, their effects could directly influence the Tree Prison. Nature’s Language could accelerate the growth, speed, and even the attack capability of Tree Prison. The Life Magnetic Field, more direct, created a weakening magnetic field effect centered around the summoned trees.\nStill, Su Ping couldn’t help but think about a particular idea. What if a group of Wanmu Wolves used these Skills together? What would be the effect? Within these woods, with life stripped away and the Tree Prisons controlled by the Wanmu Wolves, any Pet Beast that fell into the forest created by them, regardless of whether they were of the same Level or even higher, would likely perish, no matter how many came. By then, would it still be called Tree Prison? No! That would be the descent of a Tree Realm!\nIt’s just a pity there wasn’t a legendary Super-Rank Skill. Su Ping couldn’t help but feel a little greedy. Super-Rank Skills. They weren’t something that could easily appear; they represented an entirely new Domain, as Old Liu had explained in his lessons before. Even Emperor Level Pet Beasts don’t necessarily have Super-Rank Skills. Although Old Sha’s Racial Potential had reached Monarch Rank, he was still only a Commander.\nRegaining his composure, Su Ping saw the Eye of Truth’s effect on Old Sha’s abilities disappear from his sight.\nReturning to Old Sha’s expectant gaze, Su Ping smiled slightly, \"Very good, you have succeeded, and so have I!\"\nEven though he could feel the immense power within himself, Old Sha knew he had succeeded, but hearing it once again from his young master truly put his mind at ease.\nHowever, just as Su Ping was about to speak, instructing Old Sha to try out the effect of Tree Prison on the spot, he was momentarily stunned.\nAt that instant.\nHis Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas in his mind finally responded with a new activity!\nAnd this particular response was beyond his expectations:\n[The Forest Wolf Catalog has recorded an Evolutionary Body in its atlas branch: the Wanmu Wolf form. Experience Points gained: 800 points!]\n[You may now enter the Forest Wolf Catalog to examine the analysis of the Wanmu Wolf form.]\n[As the Wanmu Wolf form is a branch of the Forest Wolf’s Evolution Chart, the Wanmu Wolf form’s Catalog entry has no Level Experience Points. Experience Points gained for it will be reflected back onto the Forest Wolf Catalog!]",

      "content": "Chapter 93: Chapter 93 Wanmu Wolf’s Battle Style!\nPet Beasts that met the intimacy requirements would receive Experience Points after completing an Evolution, and Su Ping had guessed this much earlier on.\nOtherwise, he wouldn’t have asked Qin Xiaoxue to let him know when Woodhead was evolving into the Crown Wolf Emperor, as he wanted to witness this top-tier Evolution himself.\nHowever, Su Ping really hadn’t anticipated that after completing one Evolutionary Body, the Forest Wolf Catalog would undergo such a tremendous change.\nHe closed his eyes again, entering the Catalog.\nWhat really shocked him was the current Level and Experience Points of the Forest Wolf Catalog:\n[Catalog: Forest Wolf]\n[Specializes in using Wood Attribute, part of a powerful Wolf Tribe with strong Life Force. A typical adult Forest Wolf is at Elite Level, with Racial Skills including: Sunlight Absorption, Vine Strangling, Self-Healing, Accelerated Growth, etc.]\n[Current Catalog Level: 2 (1,875/2,000)]\nAfter Old Sha’s Evolution and adding the 800 Experience Points, the Forest Wolf Catalog’s experience had once more exploded unimaginably.\nIf Su Ping hadn’t spent 500 Experience Points earlier to perfect the Accelerated Casting Cultivation, he might have been able to raise the Forest Wolf Catalog to Level 3 by now. Even if it’s not possible right now, it’s coming soon! Old Sha truly is his lucky star.\nWith a smile, Su Ping then turned his thoughts to the new line of text that had appeared on the Forest Wolf Catalog:\nUnlocked Evolutionary Form:\n[Branch Catalog: Wanmu Wolf]\n[An Evolved Form of the Forest Wolf, further enhanced by sunlight and the power of natural plants, it possesses immense potential! It’s one of the top Evolutionary branches of the Forest Wolf!\nWith an even stronger control over sunlight absorption and plant powers, its Racial Skills include: Sunlight Absorption, Photosynthesis, Tree Prison, Life Magnetic Field, Language of Nature, Mutated Wood Body, Blinding Technique, etc.]\nIt’s worth mentioning that the Wanmu Wolf even has a Skill Old Sha hasn’t learned! Blinding Technique? However, it’s probably due to Old Sha’s insufficient Level, temporarily rendering it unable to comprehend it.\nBeyond these, below were the corresponding Cultivation, Evolution, and log entries, just as with the other Catalogs.\nHowever, most naturally didn’t have any significant entries.\nOnly at the very bottom was a single, thin log entry:\n[Successfully obtained Evolutionary Body: Wanmu Wolf. For each day spent with it, Forest Wolf Catalog experience +25 Experience Points!]\nIndeed, after Evolution, the Experience Points earned for the Catalog increased.\nSu Ping was very satisfied.\nIt seems the last 125 Experience Points needed for the Forest Wolf Catalog to level up won’t require much waiting at all; tomorrow’s fixed increase should just about do it! Evolutionary Cultivation is indeed the most vital stage in Pet Beast Cultivation. Even the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas awards the most Experience Points during this process.\nHowever, Su Ping also understood this was because it was the first time completing this Cultivation. Whether he could get even one-tenth of this Experience Point reward the next time he cultivated a Wanmu Wolf remained a complete unknown.\nShaking his head, Su Ping let out a breath and opened his eyes. He couldn’t help but smile seeing the majestic Old Sha.\nHe turned around to glimpse the envious stares of the other Forest Wolves, including his own Contracted Beast, Xiao Qing.\nTherefore, Su Ping spoke directly to Old Sha, \"Old Sha, use the Skill: Tree Prison!\"\n\"AWOOO!\"\nThe excited howl echoed. The next moment, in less than a second, a tree as thick as a man’s waist sprouted on the once-empty meadow, like a giant serpent uncoiling as it reached for the sky.\nSimultaneously, swaying branches spread outwards.\nIn just an instant, the vast meadow was enveloped by dense, entwining trees.\nThen, without needing any urging from Su Ping, Old Sha, having Evolved, seemed eager to try out its new Abilities!\nAbove its head, its two Y-shaped branch-like horns erupted with a verdant glow.\nA ripple emanated, and those trees, originally swaying as if they were Tree Demons, seemed instantly invigorated with a shot of adrenaline. They not only thickened several times in an instant but also began winding at an unimaginable speed.\nHowever, at this moment, there were no enemies on the field. So the extending branches and leaves, like those searching for prey, merely kept swaying and shaking, ultimately taking no further action.\nYet, in just this short time, Su Ping had already seen the power it wielded.\nWithin a radius of less than fifty meters, soil flew about as trees rose up here and there. If it weren’t for the chaotic upheaval of the soil, no one would have guessed that this had been a bare meadow just a dozen breaths earlier.\nDirect alteration of the terrain, large-area control capability, powerful Life Force and mastery, an absolute advantage within a jungle... This is the Evolved Forest Wolf! This is the Wanmu Wolf!\nAnother aspect was even more terrifying: although this forest was created by the Wanmu Wolf’s Skills, the Forest Wolves possessed the Heart of Woods Skill. This was equivalent to them fighting in a real forest, allowing them to share Energy almost perfectly!\nCurrently, there’s only one Wanmu Wolf. If their numbers increase in the future, the effect will truly be greater than the sum of its parts!\nThe most update n0vels are published on NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\n\"AWOO~\"\nAn excited howl echoed through the trees.\nAfter nearly half a month, Old Sha finally began to truly move. Bursting forth from the soil, its body was initially stiff, but this stiffness vanished at an extremely fast rate as it regained its flexibility.\nIts claws, now even sharper, hidden beneath the cover of the trees, combined with this unimaginable flexibility! This is the effect of the Mutated Wood Body.\nThe most eerie part was that if Old Sha wished, it could pass directly through those trees—which were right before its eyes—as if using an instant transmission technique. This was much like those Elemental Type Pet Beasts that aren’t hindered by their corresponding material.\nIf Tree Prison is the main combat Skill of the Evolved Wanmu Wolf, then the Mutated Wood Body is its true core Ability!\nUpon the land, the shaking trees instantly made the area shadowy and indistinct. Old Sha’s figure, along with its claws and the branches that moved in unison, appeared and disappeared unpredictably.\nWatching Old Sha move freely through this small forest it had created, Su Ping’s heart completely relaxed.\nIs this the Wanmu Wolf’s basic combat method?\n「However, at this moment, within the distant manor.」\nBehind the reinforced glass fence, everyone who had witnessed the entire scene from beginning to end was completely dumbstruck.\nAt this moment, let alone Lao Guan and the Zhang Family Brothers, even Zhang Lie hadn’t recovered his senses for a long time. They were transfixed by the terrifying jungle created in an instant; the Evolved Forest Wolf standing atop the trees, surveying its territory, the branches on its head like the twin horns of a Kylin; and the silhouette of the young Breeder standing there—slim yet upright, like the true Wolf King among the Wolf pack.",

Cooperating with the Legion?\n\"Su Ping!\"\nFinally, Guan Qianshan could no longer hold back and asked through the walkie-talkie.\nSu Ping turned his head. He had seen Guan Qianshan appear in the distance with his people earlier, but at that time, he hadn’t had the leisure to pay attention to them and hadn’t cared.\nNow that Old Sha had completed his evolution, it seemed there were no major problems or concerns to worry about. It was also a good time for Su Ping to give Old Sha some time to adapt to this new power.\nListening to the voice from the walkie-talkie, Su Ping turned back and took a glance. The distance was too great to make out faces clearly, so he finally walked past the tempered glass enclosure and entered the front area of the manor.\nAnd he finally saw who the visitors were.\n\"Eh? It’s you two brothers? I thought you wouldn’t come!\"\nOnce Su Ping recognized Zhang Wen and Zhang Wu, he smiled.\nHaving witnessed the scene just now, any resentment that the Zhang Family Brothers had harbored had now completely vanished.\nA Breeder capable of evolving a Forest Wolf! And what was more, that Forest Wolf Evolver, which resembled a Kylin, was something they had never seen nor even heard of!\nIf this Forest Wolf Evolver had been developed and Cultivated by the Breeder of his own age before them... They didn’t dare to think further. Because that would be just too preposterous.\nAt this age, there have been Breeders in Dragon Nation’s history who could develop Pet Beast evolutions on their own, some even more exaggerated than Su Ping. But the future achievements of any of these individuals were beyond what ordinary people could imagine or come into contact with. Among these people, the most famous today is the Master of the Holy Dragon in Dragon Nation!\nAt a young age, he had developed a completely new, top-potential evolution path for his Contracted Beast, the Yellow Scaled Snake: the ’Sand-Eating Jiao.’ This Sand-Eating Jiao not only possessed an even more absurd and terrifying subsequent evolution path but was also an Elite Level Pet Beast with Monarch-level Racial Potential. Most horrifying and preposterous of all, the Sand-Eating Jiao possessed a Super-Rank Skill!\nIt was precisely because of this Super-Rank Skill, researched and integrated into the evolved Yellow Scaled Snake, that it became a breakthrough worthy of being recorded in the annals of Dragon Nation’s destiny. What was once a common Elite Level Pet Beast in Ximo, the Yellow Scaled Snake, suddenly became one of the most sought-after Pet Beast choices of those years.\nUnfortunately, not everyone is the Master of the Holy Dragon. Very few could achieve the Sand-Eating Jiao evolution, and no one had heard of anyone else developing that Super-Rank Skill.ᴛhis ᴜpdated by NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nThe Su Ping before them, naturally, could not be compared with the Master of the Holy Dragon, but he already showed glimmers of such accomplishments. Even if these were just glimmers, they were beyond what ordinary people could imagine.\nTherefore, any anger they had felt due to the price hike for the Cultivation of the Heart of Woods had long since dissipated like smoke. At this moment, for the first time, aside from their father, the brothers felt genuine respect and even admiration for someone else.\nAs Su Ping asked his question, the brothers were too embarrassed to speak, especially considering their poor attitude towards Lao Guan. Zhang Lie indeed had a stomach full of questions he wanted to ask, but as the commander of the Forest Wolf Troop within the Beast Tamer Corps, he knew better than to voice certain thoughts.\nGuan Qianshan finally spoke up from the side, \"Su Ping, these two previously mentioned that you had told them the price for Cultivation is four million...\"\nSu Ping nodded and smiled. Having seen the Zhang Family Brothers, he had roughly understood the situation. Although he indeed had to count every penny now, he would not go back on his words. \"No worries,\" he said. \"If the two of you want Cultivation services, the price I quoted before stands: four million, not a penny more!\"\nThe brothers exchanged a glance and breathed a sigh of relief. Their family indeed had some wealth, but this was still a large sum of money. Their father held a certain status within the Legion. However, the Legion was the Legion; money wasn’t a primary concern in its ecosystem, so their family’s finances were indeed quite tight.\nHowever, while his sons were still quibbling over such a trivial matter, Zhang Lie had stopped caring altogether.\nHeart of Woods? The Skill Heart of Woods is certainly impressive, but how could it possibly compare to that Forest Wolf Evolver they just witnessed?\nIn just a short period of observation, he had discerned that Evolutionary Body’s Abilities.\nIncreased strength and speed were a given, not to mention its Ability to create a jungle! Whether for individual combat, group assaults, battlefield control, tandem fighting, or collaborative attacks—all of these were perfectly suited!\nWasn’t such an Evolutionary Body precisely what he was looking for—the most suitable for the Forest Wolf Troop’s elite training of evolved Pet Beasts?\nIf the Forest Wolf Troop had a few such Evolutionary Body Pet Beasts, wouldn’t missions, large-scale battles, and drills be tremendously enhanced?\nIf they had Forest Wolves capable of creating forests on their own, who would dare say the Forest Wolf Troop was narrowly specialized any longer? Only capable of fighting covertly in the woods? He’d make sure to dazzle those sons of bitches! Even during drills, he’d let them know just how formidable his troop truly was!\nAs a result, Zhang Lie’s gaze upon Su Ping grew increasingly intense. This intensity made Su Ping feel somewhat uncomfortable. It wasn’t that Su Ping was overthinking it; Zhang Lie’s gaze was simply too fervent.\nFinally, Zhang Lie couldn’t help but ask, \"Young man, what is the name of that Forest Wolf Evolver from just now? Why have I never seen it before?\"\n\"Wanmu Wolf. It’s a new evolution of the Forest Wolf, and I’ve just finished perfecting it,\" Su Ping responded, glancing at the man. He didn’t conceal anything, nor did he elaborate further.\nHowever, this seemed to be enough for Zhang Lie. So, this military man, known in the Legion for his straightforwardness, couldn’t wait to ask, \"Are you currently accepting orders for the Cultivation of this kind of Evolutionary Body here? How long would it take? And if one desires large-scale Cultivation, is that possible?\"\nA rapid-fire series of questions left Su Ping slightly stunned. He looked with a bit of incredulity at this uniquely-tempered man and asked, \"May I ask who you are?\"\nZhang Lie gave a hearty laugh and extended his hand. For the first time, he offered a warmth in his smile that he’d never shown to a youth of his son’s age, saying, \"Zhang Lie, Commander of the Forest Wolf Troop, Battle Wolf A Division of the Forest Wild Army, stationed in Jianghai Province, part of the Beast Tamer Corps. Breeder Su, would you consider collaborating with the Legion?\"\nZhang Lie? The Beast Tamer Corps?\nSu Ping blinked.\nSo that was the background of these two. No wonder during their previous battle, those two Little Forest Wolves executed their battle orders so precisely, their fighting strength far surpassing that of ordinary Forest Wolves. That explains it!\nSu Ping’s interest was piqued as well. \"Let’s talk in the guest room,\" he suggested.",

      "content": "Chapter 95: Chapter 95: Zhang Lie’s Madness, The Incredible Breeder!\nArriving at the reception room, Su Ping asked directly, \"Commander Zhang, what kind of cooperation do you have in mind?\"\nTruth be told, Su Ping had a certain fondness for the Beast Tamer Legions. The stability of the cities where Beast Tamers resided was largely due to these individuals guarding the outskirts, driving away the Ferocious Beasts that approached human society. Although different from his previous life, if a problem arose, the High-Level Beastmasters among the civilians would also take action, but it was always these Guardians who faced the brunt of it first. Moreover, the most crucial point was that his own father had reportedly once served in the Beast Tamer Legion for a period before being sacrificed in a Beast Tide. He subsequently returned home to take over the family business. His father might be unreliable, but from a young age, he had taught Su Ping to hold the proper respect for these Guardians.\nZhang Lie said eagerly, \"Here’s the situation: the Legion has decided to initiate elite training for a portion of our elite soldiers. I’ve left the Legion this time to find such Breeders, and if suitable, engage in a long-term partnership with them!\"\nSu Ping’s eyes narrowed slightly, his spirits lifted.\nA long-term partnership? This was a big business deal!\n\"Originally, it was supposed to be me, a vice-commander, and an instructor, each searching independently and then comparing our findings. However, it seems that won’t be necessary anymore!\"\nIndeed, it wasn’t necessary anymore, not with a brand-new special Cultivation Evolution and, moreover, training for the Heart of Woods Skill. How could other unreliable Breeders compare to this?\nTherefore, a thousand words congealed into that one question Zhang Lie had previously asked, \"Breeder Su, I absolutely trust your training for the Heart of Woods, and your price is worthy of your ability. But about that Wanmu Wolf just now, I wonder...\"\nGlancing at Zhang Lie, Su Ping stated frankly, \"Firstly, Old Sha’s Evolution isn’t entirely complete, though there should be no subsequent issues. I also can’t guarantee that a future attempt would be successful.\nSecondly, Old Sha’s Evolution consumed significant resources. If calculated, the cost of this Evolution isn’t low. Of course, this might be a special case; generally, it wouldn’t require spending so much.\nThirdly, the Evolution’s duration is roughly ten to fifteen days. His Racial Potential should be around the Monarch Level!\nFinally, although the Evolution is currently successful, as a newly developed type of Evolutionary Body, it still needs observation for a period to ensure stability.\"\nSu Ping answered each point in turn.\nZhang Lie’s heart pounded with even more excitement!\nA Forest Wolf Evolver with the Racial Potential to reach Monarch Level?!\nHe hastened to nod his head. \"MHM, MHM, MHM, I understand, I understand! Breeder Su, you are indeed meticulous. But that’s right; this is the hallmark of a Breeding Master. Rest assured, I believe in your abilities. How about we confirm our intent to cooperate now?\"\nIt was clear that Old Sha’s earlier appearance had given Commander Zhang a significant shock!\nAll his attention was focused on that Wanmu Wolf!\nSu Ping said, somewhat helplessly, \"I would, of course, be honored to cooperate with the Legion, but regarding the price...\"\nEven though his father taught him to respect the Beast Tamer Legion, he couldn’t just do charity work, right? Not to mention other things, even if those Sunlight Absorption Skills reached the Mastery Level, they wouldn’t require precious Sun Crystals, but they would still need Nature’s Lungs. Nature’s Lungs aren’t expensive, but they still cost over eight million. Of course, if the level of Sunlight Absorption being cultivated is only at the Proficient Level, that’s no problem; the cost would likely only be a few million. However, when it comes to price, it clearly needs to be discussed and clarified in advance.\nZhang Lie’s fiery enthusiasm suddenly cooled. He fell into thought for a moment, then said, \"Breeder Su, the Legion’s funds are limited. We can’t handle Cultivation like those in the outside world by giving you a direct sum of money! Do you think we could use Battle Merit Points for the exchange instead?\"\nBattle Merit Points?\nSu Ping raised an eyebrow.\nThat’s not hard to understand. It’s like the credits within the Breeder Association, right? Only exchangeable for items within their internal system? Truth be told, for many people, these points are even more precious than actual money. There are many things in the outside world that money can’t buy. And within organizations directly under the Dragon Nation, if nothing else, specific resources are absolutely guaranteed to be in sufficient supply. Thinking about it this way, there’s no problem. If I need money later, it wouldn’t be impossible to exchange them for cash.\nWith that thought, Su Ping nodded his head.\nZhang Lie also stood up abruptly. \"As for the specific cost in Battle Merit Points for each Cultivation, I’m not in a position to decide the exact figures. I need to return and consult my superiors!\"Follow current novels on NovᴇlFirenᴇt\nIf it were only about cultivating Skills, as the commander of the Forest Wolf Troop, he could definitely make the decision. After all, each troop has an allocation of Battle Merit Points each month, even though they were wiped out in this exercise, causing many of their points to go to others. However, some Cultivation costs can still be reimbursed by the troop itself. But if it involved cultivating an Evolutionary Body, then it was clearly not something he, as the troop commander, had the authority to decide.\nSeeing their father’s excitement and eagerness, Zhang Wen and Zhang Wu felt an indescribable emotion, even though they already knew Su Ping was remarkable. This young Breeder, Su Ping, was very impressive, but they had never imagined *this* impressive. They idolized their father, the commander of the military Beast Tamer troop who protected the nation. Yet, their father was treating this young man, someone their own age, with such deference.\nTo them, it even seemed like he had completely lost his composure!\nThis was the first time they had seen their father like this. Where had the composed, serious man gone—the father who was strict with his subordinate Beast Tamers and their Pet Beasts, the one called Cold-faced Yama by the rest of the troop? With this current anxious demeanor, he probably wasn’t even this frantic when he married their mother, right? Was that Wanmu Wolf really so powerful?\nAt this moment, the two brothers couldn’t help but think of that Forest Wolf Evolver, the one that seemed to have a Kylin’s horn. Their hearts pounded!\nHowever, the Evolutionary Body was one thing, but had their father forgotten something else? Their visit this time wasn’t to discuss this, was it? It was to find a way to cultivate the Heart of Woods for their Forest Wolf Pet Beasts!\nClearly, the Zhang Family Brothers’ silent complaints were not unfounded.\nBecause Commander Zhang Lie, head of the Forest Wolf Troop, had even forgotten his two sons were still sitting there. After a hurried exchange with Su Ping, he dashed out the door.\nAs he ran, he pulled out his phone and made a call, \"Hello, Sir! I’ve found an incredible Breeder!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 96: Chapter 96 Wanmu Wolf’s First Training Session!\nAfter glancing at Zhang Lie, who had left in a hurry, and then at the somewhat embarrassed Zhang Family Brothers sitting on the sofa, Su Ping smiled slightly, \"It’s okay, Captain Zhang has the responsibility of defending the people and the Dragon Nation. It is natural that he might neglect his personal affairs in favor of the greater good.\"\nThe Zhang Family Brothers gave Su Ping a slightly strange look. Although the words were meant as comfort, coming from Su Ping, they sounded a bit odd; but after all these years, they were used to it. The awkwardness was purely because they felt somewhat embarrassed towards Su Ping.\nHowever, Su Ping understood this, so he continued, \"So, don’t worry, you guys can come back anytime when you’re free.\"\nThe two brothers breathed a sigh of relief and left, feeling helpless.\nWatching the brothers walk away, Su Ping then continued to ponder the recent events.\nCooperation with the Beast Tamer Legion?\nA month ago, the Legion, the Beast Master Association, and the Breeder Association were all things far beyond his reach. A month later, as he had become a true Beast Tamer and awakened the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, these things were getting closer to him, even proactively approaching him. Most importantly, one of his wishes and goals was also being fulfilled.\nThat day, Su Ping felt as if he were in a dream. Everything seemed so unreal.\nBut after leaving the guest room and returning to the forest area, Su Ping, looking at Old Sha surrounded by the Forest Wolf pack, unconsciously revealed a hint of a smile in his eyes.\n\"AWOO!\"\nFeeling Su Ping’s return, the wolf pack quickly approached him, surrounding him completely.\nOld Sha’s body had grown a size larger than before, and its appearance had changed significantly. However, its gaze towards Su Ping was still as familiar as ever. Compared to before, its tongue was no longer that moist but had the texture of tree fruit, making it somewhat difficult for Su Ping to handle its licks.\nNevertheless, Su Ping did not slack off because of this. The evolution of the Wanmu Wolf might seem complete, but in reality, there was one last important phase to go. In the coming days, Old Sha had to not only move and adapt to fighting as a Wanmu Wolf but also undergo other training methods.\n\"Old Sha! Are you ready to undergo the first training session as a Wanmu Wolf!?\"\n\"AWOO!\"\n「Ten minutes later.」\nSu Ping sat on the lawn, with Xiao Qing lying on his chest. In front of him were several distinct groups. Fifty Forest Wolves were neatly organized into groups of ten. In front of these groups of Forest Wolves, there were five large wooden barrels! Inside the barrels were heaps of the Forest Wolves’ favorite meal: tree fruit.\nOld Sha’s gaze turned incredibly sharp, with a seriousness it had never shown before.\nWorthy indeed of the young master who enabled its evolution! It hadn’t expected that the training tailored for it would start so soon after its evolution!\nOld Sha slowly exhaled. The Y-shaped branches on its head shook slightly, its gaze firmly fixed on those fifty Forest Wolves.\nIs the young master expecting it to defeat these little ones as swiftly as possible? Hmph! The young master really underestimates me!\nAlthough Old Sha was serious, it had gained a deeper understanding of its own strength. Not to mention the significant difference in their Great Realms now!\nWith such a gap, even if it hadn’t completed its evolution, it could still thrash these little ones without them having any idea what hit them!\nHowever, just as Old Sha was poised to act, Su Ping finally spoke, \"Old Sha, these wooden barrels contain tree fruits of varying quantities!\"\n\"AWOO!\nHmm, are these the spoils of war?\n\"Old Sha looked at those tree fruits, its mouth watering as well. Although it had photosynthesis and didn’t require much food, it hadn’t tasted tree fruits for quite some days.\n\"Now, in front of you, there are exactly fifty Forest Wolves; among them, sixteen are Elite Level and thirty-four are Ordinary Level!\"\n\"AWOO!\nUnderstood, I’ll show these little guys how formidable I am!\n\"\nOld Sha was brimming with confidence.\n\"Now, the Ordinary Level Forest Wolves will receive two tree fruits each, and the Elite Level Forest Wolves will receive five each.\"\n\"AWOO?\nDivide?\n\"\nOld Sha looked at Su Ping with suspicion.\nWeren’t these spoils of war? Why divide them directly?\n\"There are five buckets in total, each with a different number of tree fruits. Also, the number of Elite and Ordinary Level wolves varies among the different Forest Wolf squads!\"\n\"So, you need to distribute the tree fruits from these five buckets as quickly as possible. According to the earlier requirement, you must place them into the five Forest Wolf squads, ensuring each wolf gets the correct number of tree fruits!\"\n\"AWOO?\"\nOld Sha looked puzzledly at Su Ping, who was sitting on the lawn with a serious and earnest appearance, and once again questioned its wolf life.\nIs this... the young master’s special advanced training for the Ten Thousand Wood Wolf Evolution? Isn’t it about combat? Isn’t it about defeating these little ones as fast as possible?\nOld Sha looked at the tree fruits in the buckets and at the five different squads of Forest Wolves, sorted by Level, and for a moment, couldn’t wrap its head around it.\nIt was somewhat stumped, but when it saw its young master’s gaze turning stern, it let out a pained howl. Recalling the rules Su Ping had just explained, it started on the special training.\nOld Sha first approached the foremost squad of Wolf Pets, casting a glance over them.\nThree Elite Level, seven Ordinary Level. According to what the young master had just said, Elite Level get five tree fruits each, Ordinary Level two. And so...\nOld Sha looked at its paws.\nFour toes on the front paws, one on the hind paw... three Elite Level, eating five tree fruits each means one Elite Level Forest Wolf eats one paw’s worth of tree fruits...\nSoon, Old Sha became confused because it realized that the toes on its four legs were not enough to count with!Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nThree Elite Level Forest Wolves would consume the toes of three paws, the Ordinary Level...\nAfter ten minutes, with eyes red-rimmed, Old Sha squeezed out two tears from the corners of its eyes. This first Ten Thousand Wood Wolf Evolution, which just moments ago resembled a majestic Kylin after completing its evolution, no longer appeared tall and mighty. Instead, it lay on the grass, paws up in the air. Those colorless pupils stared at the four paws raised to the sky.\nDamn it! Why does a wolf only have four paws?! Why does each paw only have five toes?! Why didn’t the Wanmu Wolf’s evolution give it a few extra toes?!\nHowever, thankfully, after racking its brains, Old Sha finally caught on. With a sudden movement, it stood up from the ground, and the next moment, coiled branches appeared from the ground.\nIt might not have enough toes, but it could use branches as substitutes!\nUnfortunately, just as this ’cheating’ move was about to start, Su Ping spoke up from not too far away, \"No using Skills allowed, only calculation in your head is permitted!\"\n\"AWOO...\"\nA woeful wolf howl resounded above the Heart of Woods.\nProbably no one would have imagined that this first Wanmu Wolf of its kind, which anyone would naturally treasure and coddle upon its appearance, would undergo mathematical permutations and combinations as its very first training.",

      "content": "Chapter 97: Chapter 97: Dad Coming Home Tomorrow?\nWatching Old Sha’s agony, Su Ping was not the slightest bit inclined to compromise or accommodate; he was resolute in carrying out the training plan!\nNot just for Old Sha. In the future, upon the creation of new Wanmu Wolves, after completing their Evolution, every single one of them would have to engage in strenuous mathematical operations and bodily recovery.\nAs the Breeder who had thoroughly perfected the Evolution method for the Wanmu Wolf, Su Ping had also identified the risks and harms of the woodification process in the past few days. Not to mention, after the Wanmu Wolf had completed its Evolution, it would gain a Skill called ’Mutation: Wood Body’. They could freely maintain both animal and plant forms.\nPreviously, when Old Sha maintained a plant state, the transmission of thought and reaction was quite stiff.\nIf one were to give an example, it was somewhat like a patient in my previous life who initially showed symptoms of a cerebral infarction.\nAlthough this condition was completely reversed after the Evolution was completed, Su Ping still had to ensure that nothing could go wrong.\nOf course, cerebral infarctions might fundamentally differ from woodification, but physical activity and brain function would undoubtedly decrease the probability of woodification.\nEven though these combinations and permutations of basic math problems were already very difficult for Old Sha, Su Ping showed no intention of easing the difficulty.\nAt this moment, Xiao Qing let out a soft howl.\nSu Ping naturally understood what this little fellow meant.\nCompared to the others, my first Soul Contract Pet Beast seemed to lack presence. Old Sha is now the Wolf King of the Forest Wolf pack and a family member who has been with me for many years. The Paperman is the designated second Pet Beast, bound to the mysteries of the Secret Realm. On the other hand, even though Xiao Qing is a Poison Type Mutation, it’s precisely because of this reason that many of the normal Forest Wolf Cultivation techniques can’t be directly applied to her. Yet, my affection for Xiao Qing is no different. After all, in this world, a Soul Contract is an even more solid relationship and bond than blood relations. It’s just that, as for the corresponding training and Evolution research for Xiao Qing, not to mention making any progress, I haven’t even found the right direction.\n\"Don’t worry, you will become as strong as Old Sha in the future, or even stronger!\"\n\"AWOO!\"\nXiao Qing responded naively. In those green, shiny eyes was an absolute affirmation of trust in her master.\nThe day drew to a close, along with the training and Evolution. Finally, after Su Ping had spent the entire day busy, recording the specific evolutionary steps of the Wanmu Wolf in his notebook, he washed up and lay comfortably on his bed.\nDespite the exhaustion from the hard work, Su Ping was not at all sleepy; instead, his brain was extremely excited. He had now reached the regular tenth Level and was on the verge of breaking through to the Elite Level, but Su Ping was in no mood for meditation.\nThe experience of the day was too dreamlike. The long-anticipated Evolution has finally been completed.\nIn his excitement, Su Ping also felt a touch of loneliness.\nI really want to share this joy with someone right now.\nThe first person Su Ping thought of was undoubtedly his unreliable father. He checked and, to his surprise, Su Anyong’s avatar was lit up, clearly indicating he was online.\n[Su Ping: You there?]\nThis time, his father’s response was unexpectedly quick, catching Su Ping off guard.\n[Su Anyong: ?]\n[Su Anyong: Something happened at home?]\n[Su Ping: ?]\n[Su Ping: Do I seem as unreliable as you?]\n[Su Anyong: ?]\n[Su Anyong: Looks like it. Let’s get one thing straight first—if it’s over twenty million, you’re on your own.]\nSu Ping couldn’t be bothered to play guessing games with Su Anyong.\nThe best way to impress Dad is always to be direct.\n[Su Ping: But something huge happened! You’ll never guess!]\n...\nAfter waiting for a while, his father didn’t ask any further questions. Instead, he remained silent, obviously waiting for Su Ping to speak.\nLying in bed, Su Ping could even imagine his father’s \"I’ve already seen through you\" expression, making him feel helpless. So, after waiting three minutes, Su Ping couldn’t hold it in anymore and sent Su Anyong a message:\n[Su Ping: Old Sha Evolved!]\nAs expected, Su Anyong had been waiting for Su Ping’s message. The moment it appeared, he replied immediately. His reply was as succinct as ever:\n[Su Anyong: ?]\n[Su Ping: I Evolved Old Sha! Awesome, right?]\n[Su Anyong: ?]\n[Su Anyong: Is Old Sha okay?]\n[Su Ping: ?]\n[Su Ping: What do you mean? You don’t believe me?]\n[Su Anyong: I believe you! Whatever my son says is true. So, Master Su Da, what is Old Sha’s Evolutionary Body? A Forest Wolf?]\n[Su Ping: The Wanmu Wolf! A brand new species that no one has ever achieved through Evolution before. Your son perfected it! Awesome, right!?]\n...\nThis time, Su Ping waited several more minutes, but no messages came through. Just as Su Ping was about to ask again, Su Anyong’s belated message finally arrived:Thɪs updatᴇd by NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\n[Su Anyong: Son, I admit I was wrong this time, but I had no choice! Your Second Grandpa was really pressuring me...]\n[Su Anyong: I had a feeling you were acting odd that day. Have you been under a lot of pressure recently? All that talk about our Jianghai Province facility being the biggest Forest Wolf breeding center in the Dragon Nation was just an excuse to get you to come home.]\n[Su Anyong: It’s not necessary! No matter what, our family has some savings. If worse comes to worst, we can sell the Heart of Woods and get out of this business. We’d have enough for both of us to live worry-free for the rest of our lives.]\n[Su Anyong: Of course, if you really do have some problem, this money can help me find you a good medical Beast Tamer, or even a Beast Tamer specializing in mental health. I’d go bankrupt if it meant getting you the treatment you need!]\n[Su Anyong: I know you’re not too satisfied with your Beast Taming Talent, but Talent isn’t the only thing that influences a Beast Tamer’s future, right? Besides, Talents can change too, can’t they?]\n[Su Anyong: So, don’t feel so much pressure! Really, if we can continue on this Breeder path, we will. If not, it’s not worth getting so worked up over.]\n[Su Anyong: ^^]\nAnd to think, in all these years, this is the first time I’ve felt what could be called fatherly warmth and concern from Dad. These words... if it were any other time, or if I really were sick, anyone reading them would acknowledge Su Anyong as a competent father.\nUnfortunately, the more Su Ping read, the deeper the lines on his forehead became.\n[Su Ping: I’m not sick! The Heart of Woods and the Wanmu Wolf are real!]\nSilence ensued for another five minutes, nearly lulling Su Ping to sleep on his bed.\n[Su Anyong: Good, good, as long as you’re not sick, that’s all that matters! If you’re not sick, I can thrash you with a clear conscience!]\n[Su Anyong: The perfected Heart of Woods and this Wanmu Wolf, you say?]\n[Su Anyong: You little brat, pulling my leg! Just wait till I get home tomorrow, I’ll show you how ’Bamboo Shoots Stir-fried with Pork’ is really made!]\nSu Ping had no desire to explain any further, so he simply turned off his phone and decided to sleep.\nBut then he suddenly sat bolt upright, startled.\nDad’s coming home tomorrow?",

      "content": "Chapter 98: Chapter 98: The Great Military Competition! The Prodigal Father! (Seeking First Subscription)\nJianghai, in the easternmost part of Linzhou, adjoins the vast West Dragon Lake but lies hidden within a secluded expanse of mountains and forest. This area is considered the outermost region of Linzhou. It doesn’t fall within any urban zone and is rarely visited. However, within these mountains and forests, lies a sprawling complex of imposing buildings. High walls and specialized partitions, deep within this primeval forest, clearly indicated the nature of this place. This is a massive Legion base. Although near West Dragon Lake, as a land-based Legion base, it primarily serves as the station for two Jianghai Province land army Legions. Among them was, undoubtedly, the Forest Wolf Land Army.\nWithin the base, at the command center of War Wolf Division A, two figures were gathered. Judging by their ranks, they were clearly high-ranking officers of War Wolf Division A.\nA man in his forties, frowning slightly, sat in a large chair in the center of the room, looking at Zhang Lie before him:\n\"A kid the same age as your son? A brand-new Forest Wolf Evolver? Heart of Woods?\"\nThe man smacked his lips. \"Old Zhang, you hurried back from Linzhou just to tell me you’ve found such an extraordinary Genius Breeder?\"\nClearly, the cautious man standing before him was Zhang Lie, who had appeared at the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base yesterday. After seeing the Wanmu Wolf Evolutionary Body, the leader of the Forest Wolf Troop had barely paused before immediately returning to the Legion. And he had reported the matter to the officer before him.\nThe man didn’t doubt Zhang Lie. He had been Zhang Lie’s squad leader when Zhang Lie first enlisted as a raw recruit, so he knew his character well. Zhang Lie wouldn’t lie or spout nonsense about such matters. This was also why, after the Forest Wolf Troop had suffered a significant defeat in an exercise against Division C’s Rock Tiger Troop, he had been lenient. If any other troop leader had been responsible, he wouldn’t have hesitated to, figuratively speaking, throw them to the pigs, or something nearly as severe. But since it was his old comrade, he had only made him write a self-criticism report and, incidentally, instructed him to learn from the experiences of their brother division.\nThe War Wolf Division specialized in Beast Tamer corps that used Wolf Pets as their primary force within the army. For an army Legion, only a few types of Pet Beasts were suitable, and Wolf Pets were undoubtedly among the most outstanding. They are highly obedient and disciplined. Therefore, Wolf Pet Beast Tamers were the most numerous type of Beast Tamers in the army’s land-based corps. Such Wolf Pet Breeders were needed not only by the outside world but even more so internally by the Legion.\nHowever, despite his trust, this all sounded a bit far-fetched, didn’t it?!\nA kid about the same age as his son, a Breeder? Not only had he cultivated the rare and precious Wood Heart Skill, but he had even developed a new Evolutionary Body. Do you even know what you’re talking about, Zhang Lie?\nNevertheless, he knew a thing or two about this soldier who had always followed him and said with a slight frown, \"You’re a Troop Leader now, with decision-making power over certain matters. I can tell you the truth right now; this isn’t a simple issue. General Zhao himself has been dissatisfied for years with the worsening state of talent cultivation within the Legion, and now he sees an opportunity for change. So, in fact, it’s not just your Forest Wolf Troop. The entire Forest Wolf Land Army—our division and others—will also be conducting elite cultivation, encompassing Evolutionary Bodies and Cultivation Skills. Moreover, when the time comes, the Legion will hold a grand competition based on the results of the elite squads’ cultivation. Not only I and the other division commanders, but several generals, including General Zhao himself, will be there to observe!\"\nWith that said, the man needed not say more, as he had made himself quite clear. If the Forest Wolf Troop still finished last in the grand competition, it wouldn’t just be a humiliation within the division. The entire Legion would know that War Wolf Division A’s Forest Wolf Troop was nothing but a bunch of losers! It could even lead to a reassessment at the command center regarding whether the Forest Wolf Pet Beast is still suitable as a main combat Pet Beast for an army Legion-level unit. This could reduce the required number of enlistees. Perhaps in a few years, the Forest Wolf Troop might even be downgraded to the Forest Wolf Company. The consequences of such an outcome would be unimaginable and unbearable!Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs\nUpon hearing this, even Zhang Lie was slightly startled; he had not realized the situation was so grave. However, the image of what he had witnessed yesterday at the small Heart of Wood Cultivation Base emerged in his mind once again: the Wanmu Wolf that could summon the jungle, moving unseen within it, terrifyingly formidable.\nZhang Lie gritted his teeth. \"Chief, around when will the grand competition begin?\"\n\"This time, it’s not a large-scale competition but one for elite teams. However, these won’t be the usual ten-member squads, but five-member tactical squads. Therefore, the cultivation period won’t be long. It will start in two months, coinciding with the new recruit enlistment! The announcement will be made throughout the entire Legion in two days! I’m telling you this in advance so you can get a head start on preparations!\"\nAfter a pause, the man continued, \"Simultaneously, the highest Level for the cultivated tactical squad elites must not exceed the Commanding Rank. If they reach Monarch Level, the elite squad cultivation loses its comparative value. Additionally, each Beast Tamer can only summon and use one Pet Beast to fully demonstrate the combat effectiveness of this elite cultivation.\"\nTwo months, huh!",

In such a short amount of time, he could probably only ask one Breeder to carry out the Cultivation.\nThen, could that little guy do it?\nHowever, it was obvious that in this situation, finding another Breeder wouldn’t be easy for Zhang Lie.\nSo, he gritted his teeth and nodded. \"Alright! Then, Commander, what about the payment from their side?\"\n\"You can negotiate that. The Cultivation costs can be exchanged for an equivalent amount of Battle Merit Points! Of course, our Legion can’t take advantage of them. It’s acceptable to give a little extra with Battle Merit Points!\nIn any case, General Zhao supports it this time. I daren’t speak of other follow-ups, but the Cultivation of this elite group of five is definitely no problem!\nEven more so, there was some buzz this time: according to the Breeder’s Ability and the final ranking in the martial competition, a few honorary military titles would be released!\"Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\nHearing the last sentence, Zhang Lie’s pupils slightly contracted.\nIt seemed there was going to be some major movement from above? Was this small elite Cultivation trial within the division just an appetizer?\nWith his superior’s guarantee, Zhang Lie nodded, said a brief word, then immediately turned and left.\nFirst, he would go to his own regiment, find a few top soldiers—at least at the Elite Peak Level—and then go negotiate terms with that young Breeder Su!\nThis time’s Legion competition was relying on this little ancestor!\n「...」\n[After spending a whole day in close contact with two Forest Wolves, your Forest Wolf Catalog Experience Points +80.]\n[Current Forest Wolf Catalog Experience Points: (1,935/2,000)]\n「Inside the airport terminal of Linzhou City.」\nSu Ping was checking the feedback from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas in his mind with satisfaction while yawning vacantly.\nHe had been woken up early in the morning by a phone call from his dad, without even having breakfast, and had ended up here.\nObviously, Su Ping had every reason to suspect that Su Anyong had genuinely been scared by him yesterday and had then taken the opportunity to retaliate.\nHe had been woken at just past six in the morning and hurriedly called to the airport.\nBut he had ended up sitting there for a full four hours, and it was now almost noon. He had even meditated for a while on the chair, but there was still no word from Su Anyong; even his phone was silent.\nCould it be that the plane had an accident?\nBut that seemed unlikely.\nLinzhou, as the capital city of Jianghai Province and one of the central cities in the east, actually had only this one airport.\nOn Blue Star, in this world of Controlling Beasts, airplanes were no trivial matter.\nMoreover, airplanes as a means of transport were beyond what ordinary people could enjoy.\nIndeed, the current so-called airport lounge occupied less than even a third of the Breeder Association’s area.\nYet even so, there weren’t many people here.\nThat was exactly why.\nEven with the Beast Tamer Air Force Legion, it was hard to guarantee absolute safety in the sky.\nFlying Pet Beasts frequently appeared in the sky.\nTherefore, airplanes weren’t things that easily had accidents from minor collisions. They were, in fact, one of the strategic resources.\nIt was said that every large airplane in the sky was either a Mechanical Pet Beast or a Semi-Mechanical Pet Beast, their Levels far beyond what ordinary people could imagine.\nOnly in this way could safety be guaranteed when flying.\nBecause of this, the price of plane tickets was unimaginably expensive.\nTo travel from Beihai City to Linzhou, an average person would probably have to save for one or two years, forgoing food and drink, just hoping for a discount to afford a single trip. It was a true luxury item.\nOf course, it was said that this wasn’t even the most expensive and luxurious option.\nEven more expensive and luxurious were the ’airplanes’ with cultivated space Attributes.\nSu Ping had only heard of such things.\nFinally, just as Su Ping was preparing to start meditating again, a figure walked over from a distance.\nA long cashmere coat with a black and white checkered pattern, intermingled with faint dark gold shades, was clearly made from the wool of the special Pet Beast ’Lucent Gold Sheep,’ ensuring both warmth and style. Black sunglasses concealed his eyes, but the lines of his nose and jaw were remarkably sharp and rugged. Combined with his standard build, facial features, and slightly downturned mouth, it was obvious this was a rather handsome middle-aged man.\nAfter scanning the area, the man approached Su Ping, hurriedly took off the coat, removed his sunglasses, and complained directly, \"The weather in Linzhou is way too different from Beihai City! Son, take care of this for me—don’t wrinkle it, it cost 30,000!\"\nSu Ping looked speechlessly at his dad, who had been away from home for more than a month. Then, he pretended to look behind him. \"Weren’t you supposed to find me a stepmom? Where is she? Didn’t you bring her back for me to see?\"\nSu Anyong waved his hand and started walking out on his own. \"She was too shy to come. Plus, she thought she should prepare a gift for a first visit, so she decided not to come this time. We can talk about it when we get home.\"\n\"Prepare a gift? That’s polite, isn’t it?\"\nHe really found a stepmom for himself?\nExiting the airport, Su Anyong glanced at his son, who was standing by the roadside ready to hail a taxi, and casually waved his hand. \"Why hail a taxi?\"\nSu Ping turned around. \"How else are we supposed to get back? Even though this is a suburban airport, summoning large Pet Beasts for direct riding isn’t allowed.\"",

(Seeking First Subscription)_3\nSu Anyong cracked a slight smile, then a flash of light flickered.\nUnder the sunlight, a dazzling silver-white reflection appeared before Su Ping’s eyes, almost blinding him.\nIt wasn’t just Su Ping; all those coming out of the airport couldn’t help but fix their gazes on the object.\n\"What the fuck?!\"\nSu Ping blinked, staring at the thing before him, initially at a loss for words. It was a silver-white sports car.\nFrom the awed gasps of the onlookers, one could understand its striking appearance.\nAnd Su Anyong, the center of attention, walked forward, opened the door of the silver-white sports car, and, with everyone watching, put his dark sunglasses on again, looking at Su Ping who still hadn’t come to his senses.\n\"What are you spacing out for? Get in the car!\"\nIt had to be said, although Su Anyong’s way of showing off was simple, it was truly and directly effective.\nThe design of the sports car, and even its slightly hovering base, all proclaimed its value.\nThe envious, jealous gazes of the passersby and the shocked expression on his son’s face clearly pleased Su Anyong.\nSu Ping belatedly got into the passenger seat, looking at the smug Su Anyong.\n\"Is this yours? Where did you get it?\"\n\"What kind of question is that? If it’s not mine, is it yours? Cut the crap. *Super Shadow, home!*\"\nThe car started.\nAnd it even has voice-activated intelligent control? No need for a driver?\n\"Su Anyong, you haven’t done anything outrageous, have you? What kind of rich stepmother could buy you this thing? This has got to be in the tens of millions, right?\"\n\"Country bumpkin!\"\nWith a look of disdain, Su Anyong glanced at his son and then waved his hand.\n\"Take a look at this: Mechanical Core. Even though it hasn’t been successfully activated to become a sentient Mechanical Pet Beast, it’s still a genuine intelligent supercar. Tens of millions? The market price is at least two hundred million!\"\nSu Ping’s eyes turned red, and he lunged over, grabbing the old man’s throat.\n\"Old man, is this how you squander money? I’ve always wanted to buy that extraction compressor and never did, and you spent all that money on this piece of crap?\"\n\"Piece of crap? Buying that compressor would have been the real piece of crap. This car is freaking cool! Just look at these lines, look at the workmanship...\"\nSu Ping glared at Su Anyong resentfully.\nIndeed, he was mistaken. He had actually thought his old man was off doing some serious business. But now, this floating supercar... it didn’t look like something acquired through legitimate means.\nMeeting his son’s gaze, Su Anyong cleared his throat again.\n\"Alright, this thing has a special and complicated origin. It wasn’t bought with money, so rest assured.\"\n\"Bullshit! It would be abnormal if it *was* bought with money. Spit it out, what exactly were you up to this time?\"\nSu Ping scrutinized Su Anyong intensely.\nIndeed, this thing had a Mechanical Core. It was an autonomous vehicle, requiring no control.\nSu Anyong’s eyes suddenly turned profound. He took a cigarette out of his pocket, put it in his mouth, lit it, and the car’s automatic air ventilation system activated simultaneously.\nSeeing Su Ping genuinely curious about this feature, Su Anyong smirked.\n\"How about that? Isn’t it worth every penny?\"\nSu Ping gave him a sidelong glance.\nSu Anyong gave a sheepish chuckle before resuming his profound look, eyeing Su Ping and speaking word by word, \"Son, I’ve actually always had a hidden identity. I’m a very powerful Beast Tamer.\"\n\"?\"\n\"This trip to Beihai City wasn’t just to find you a stepmother; a big client also sought me out for a major deal! This supercar is their payment! Of course, looking for a stepmother for you wasn’t neglected either.\"\n\"You? A powerful Beast Tamer? How powerful? Then why are you holed up in a small cultivation center?\"\n\"Naturally, it’s to take care of you, my foolish son. As for how strong... maybe just a tiny bit stronger than your grandfather.\"\nSu Anyong blew a smoke ring, his expression one of nonchalance that was nevertheless profoundly deep.\n\"And now, you’ve finally come of age, and I can finally rest assured and go finish the things I left undone back then!\"\nSu Ping’s gaze was calm. He nodded.\n\"I see. I didn’t expect Old Su to be someone with a story. Could it be that back then, you were forced by some people, or some circumstances, and that’s why you retired to our Heart of Woods...\"\n\"Yes, I didn’t expect, Xiao Ping, that you could understand me. If I had known earlier...\"\n\"Understand my ass! You, a powerful Beast Tamer? Why don’t you just say you’re Haotian Douluo? Don’t fucking try that crap on me! Spill it!\"\nAlthough he didn’t know what Haotian Douluo was, seeing his not-so-clever lie exposed, Su Anyong shrugged sheepishly.\nBut he soon pulled himself together. \"You little brat! Don’t push your luck! Questioning me now? I haven’t even settled your score yet!\"\n\"My score? What score is there to settle?\"\nSu Ping blinked, pretending to be clueless.\nSu Anyong chuckled coldly, baring his chillingly white teeth.\n\"I’m telling you, if anything happens to Old Sha, I might not be able to bring myself to kill you, you little rascal, but breaking your legs is definitely on the table. You better remember that!\"\nSu Ping swallowed, feigning a guilty conscience, and chuckled dryly.\n\"Old Su, isn’t that a bit too harsh?\"\nSu Anyong chuckled coldly again, this time with an air of certainty, and gave Su Ping an icy stare.\nSu Ping seemed to deflate suddenly, whispering, \"What if... what I said was true?\"\n\"Heh, if that’s the case, I’ll call you ’Dad’.\"\nSu Ping looked as if his scheme had succeeded; all pretense vanished, and he smiled.\n\"Tsk, alright then.\"Thɪs updatᴇd by\nThat damn old man! He just took off whenever he pleased, leaving Heart of Woods to me, a fresh graduate. And now he’s back, not only inexplicably bringing this sports car but also feeding me such a stupid excuse. Does he think it’s still the past? Think I’m an idiot? And now he thinks he’s in the right? I told the old geezer before, but he didn’t believe me. It made all my attempts to impress him fall flat. In that case, Su Anyong, you can’t blame me for what comes next!\nSu Ping sneered inwardly.\nHowever, regaining his composure and contemplating the ultra-modern interior of the sports car, along with all the eyes and attention it attracted on the road, Su Ping couldn’t help but grin.\nThis thing really is cool. And it suits my temperament perfectly.\nHe gently caressed its surface; the special metal combined with some unknown type of fine leather texture defined what an Advanced Level feel truly was.\nThus, Su Ping thought for a moment, then under Su Anyong’s suspicious gaze, he nodded and said, \"Forget about calling me ’Dad’. Just give me this car when the time comes.\"",

Aren’t you working today? Why are you at my house?\"Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs\nGuan Qianshan coughed slightly in embarrassment before smiling and saying, \"Isn’t it because I’m waiting for the boss to come back!\"\nThe boss?\nSu Anyong gave him a suspicious glance, then his eyes suddenly lit up, \"Oh right, there’s another boss behind Yun Tian, right? It’s rare for him to come over. Alright, after you’re finished with your work, let’s have a couple of drinks tonight. I’m going home first. This stinky kid has made a mess while I was away.\"\nSu Anyong talked to himself.\nHowever, before he could even get back to the main door, Su Ping, who was behind him, had already smiled and said, \"Uncle Guan, nothing much this morning, right?\"\n\"Two clients came seeking Pet Beast Cultivation. Though they hadn’t made an appointment, they showed interest in Cultivation and are likely to come pay the deposit in a few days!\"\nGuan Qianshan said cheerfully, then under Su Anyong’s surprised and suspicious gaze, he slowly opened the main door of his own Heart of Woods.\nMeanwhile, his own son had already stepped past him and entered through the door nonchalantly.\nSu Anyong blinked, somewhat unable to catch up with what was happening.\nLooking at Uncle Guan who was still standing by the door with a beam, then at Su Ping who seemed to be accustomed to the scene, his eyebrows slightly raised, and his eyelid twitched.\nFor some reason, Su Anyong suddenly had a bad premonition.\nHe quickly turned his gaze to Guan Qianshan and continued to ask suspiciously, \"Uncle Guan, what’s going on here?\"\nGuan Qianshan just smiled, not giving an answer, but Su Ping had already started speaking, \"Nothing much. I’ve been busy with my own things. Our family’s business has been doing well lately, and it’s a bit too much for one person to handle. Uncle Guan happened to encounter some issues, so I asked him to come help out at our house!\"\n\"Ah?\"\nSu Anyong was momentarily taken aback.\nBusiness doing well, too busy to handle.\nThese two key terms made Old Su’s CPU struggle to keep up.\nWhat could his unlucky son be busy with? That their meager business was barely scraping by had already surprised him. If it weren’t for his father’s dying wish, he would have abandoned this money-losing Cultivation business long ago; how could it be doing well? Could it be that this scamp had a fire sale on those Little Forest Wolves? To avoid the hassle of rearing them? And he was still too busy to manage?\nSu Anyong subconsciously pressed his lips together as he followed into his home.\nAs expected, Lao Guan followed him inside and closed the door.\n\"What the heck are you playing at, kid?\"\nSu Ping glanced sideways at him and ignored him.\nNow you ask? Too late!\nSu Ping didn’t bother with him and went straight into the house.\nSu Anyong was truly baffled now and turned to look at Lao Guan, \"Lao Guan, what’s happening?!\"\nGuan Qianshan just shrugged. Su Ping had instructed him earlier not to say a word to Su Anyong!\nAfter all, Su Ping was the one paying his salary now!\nMoreover, Su Ping had promised to Cultivate a Pet Beast for his daughter. He didn’t expect to Cultivate that Evolutionary Body, but having a Pet Beast from Heart of Woods would be great too!\nGiven this situation, even with his years of friendship with Old Su, it was clearly impossible for him to betray his current boss.\nSu Anyong? Really not that close!\nLooking at Lao Guan’s indifferent expression, Su Anyong’s curiosity was piqued.\n\"So you’re playing riddles with me now! Fine, I’ll see what kind of medicine you’re selling in your gourd! By the way, what happened to that mutated Little Forest Wolf I gave you?\"\nBack in the living room, Su Anyong asked directly, \"Oh, you mean Xiao Qing? I was just about to ask, where did you get her from?\"\nWith a flash of light in Su Ping’s hand, Xiao Qing, who had been inside the Beast Taming Space, appeared beside him.\nHowever, having taken a clear look at Xiao Qing, Su Anyong was obviously a bit slow to react, involuntarily uttering a hum.\nThe reason was simple: the mutated Little Forest Wolf’s size had greatly increased compared to a month ago.\nIts aura and size clearly revealed the growth the little wolf pup had achieved in the span of a month!\n\"Got her from a friend... WTF?! Ordinary Ninth Rank?!\"\nSu Anyong looked incredulously at the faint aura emanating from Xiao Qing.\nIt’s true that as a Pet Beast of a Beast Tamer, its growth speed tends to be relatively faster, much faster than normal growth.\nBut this was ridiculously fast.\nGoing from a normal First Rank to an ordinary Ninth Rank in a month is something very unusual for a normal Beast Tamer.\nYet now, it was happening right before his eyes, and he couldn’t help but believe it.\nMore crucially, Su Anyong’s eyebrows soon furrowed slightly.\nThis Little Forest Wolf was one he gave to Su Ping, so he naturally knew what was going on.\nWith the potential of mutating a Poison Attribute, the future was promising for this mutated Forest Wolf.\nFurthermore, if they found some Senior Breeders to map out and achieve this mutated Forest Wolf’s Mutated Evolution through Cultivation, then its future would be brilliant. It could even surpass him as a main battle Pet Beast.\nSu Anyong was all too aware of the potential of such mutated Pet Beasts.\nBut at this moment, he could feel that the aura of the Little Forest Wolf in front of him was a bit off. It gave him a very familiar yet special sensation.",

He didn’t even have time to answer Su Ping’s question, fixating intently on Xiao Qing before him.\nPerhaps sensing Su Anyong’s gaze, Xiao Qing hid slightly behind Su Ping.\nSu Anyong’s Talented Ability was the uncommon Eye of Truth, which couldn’t specifically analyze through observation and sight what was wrong with the Little Forest Wolf before him.\nAfter all, Xiao Qing hadn’t made a move or activated any Skills, so the situation couldn’t be intuitively analyzed.\nEventually, Su Anyong couldn’t help but ask, \"Su Ping, there’s something off about this mutated Forest Wolf, right?\"\n\"What’s off?\"\nSu Ping pretended to be nonchalant, waving his hand as if he knew nothing.\nThen, he saw his father’s slightly narrowed gaze.\nSubsequently, a gleam of light emerged in Su Anyong’s eyes, and a burst of spiritual power instantly caused Xiao Qing to react.\nTHUMP-THUMP. A heartbeat sounded as the invisible Wood Attribute power in the air instantly rushed into Xiao Qing’s body!\nXiao Qing’s fur became even more verdant, as if myriad threads were constantly swaying because of it.\nThis scene, too, was caught by Su Anyong’s eyes. As someone who had worked with the Heart of Woods for so many years, Su Anyong, no matter what, would not fail to recognize what this scene represented!\nHe suddenly sat up straight, staring at Xiao Qing in disbelief. \"Heart of Woods?! Is it really the Heart of Woods!?\"\nSu Ping gave this shameless old man a sidelong glance.\nNow you’re surprised?\nHis smile unwavering, he ruffled Xiao Qing’s head. He nodded, yet also nonchalantly shook his head. \"Yes, and no. It’s the Heart of Woods Skill, alright. But due to Xiao Qing’s Mutation, this Skill has transformed into the Mutated Skill ’Heart of the Poison Wood’. It possesses all the effects of Heart of Woods and, additionally, is mixed with a Poison Attribute!\"\nHe didn’t continue speaking, as Su Anyong was staring firmly at him.\nHis eyes were wide, as if questioning how Su Ping had managed it.\nHowever, the tables had turned. Initially, when Su Ping had spoken bluntly on the phone, his father hadn’t believed him. Naturally, Su Ping wasn’t inclined to satisfy his curiosity now.\nBut clearly, Su Anyong didn’t have the leisure to argue with his son about this now and couldn’t help but ask, \"Cultivated from the Magic Potion recipe for Heart of Woods?\"\n\"Mm-hm.\"\nSu Ping ruffled Xiao Qing’s head.\n\"A one percent chance, and you hit it? Or is this mutated Little Forest Wolf truly that extraordinarily talented?\"\nSu Anyong looked at Xiao Qing.\nXiao Qing also raised its head, the little creature finally finding some sense of importance.\nSu Ping rolled his eyes. \"Xiao Qing’s Talent goes without saying. Besides, I merely took the liberty of perfecting the Heart of Woods recipe.\"\nTook the liberty? Perfected the recipe?\nSu Anyong blinked. He looked at his son, who was calmly showing off, and for a moment, he couldn’t quite grasp the claim.\nIs this kid telling the truth?\nBack in his day, he had attempted to perfect the Magic Potion recipe for Heart of Woods countless times.\nEvidently, Su Anyong had no real Talent when it came to Pet Beast Cultivation.\nAfter several failed attempts, he’d stopped wasting his energy on it.\nThis had been the lifelong wish of his own father, Su Ping’s grandfather.\nOtherwise, this Cultivation base wouldn’t have been named ’Heart of Wood’ so directly.\nAnd now, he had only been away for a month—such a short time! Damn it, upon his return, his son, who had just graduated a month ago, was telling him he’d casually perfected the recipe?\nAnyone would find such a thing hard to believe.\nSu Anyong was no exception.\nSo, when Su Ping had spoken, Su Anyong hadn’t seriously considered that possibility. At most, he’d thought his son had made some minor, perhaps presumptuous, improvements.\nBut now, it seemed like there was more to it.\nSo, Su Anyong paused before asking, \"To what extent did you perfect it?\"\nWith others, Su Ping would naturally be more reserved. But facing his own father, Su Ping smacked his lips, feigned deep thought, and then said lightly, \"I can’t say exactly to what extent, but of all the Forest Wolves I’ve cultivated so far, not a single one has failed!\"\nSu Anyong pursed his lips. After a long pause, his voice somewhat hoarse, he asked, \"Then, how many have you cultivated?\"\nTo be honest, Su Ping really needed to calculate this carefully. \"Let me think... Our family had over twenty Forest Wolves before, and all of them have been fully cultivated. Later, I bought over twenty more to make it a round number. I haven’t started cultivating those new ones yet. However, many of the clients who came by brought some. In the past few days, to help Old Sha’s Evolution, I used up a lot of resources and needed more money, so I cultivated a few more—about ten in total, I’d say. Yes, that’s about it. Roughly forty or so in total!\"\nSu Ping nodded. Then he saw the utterly stunned look in his father’s eyes.\nAfter blinking a few times, Su Anyong asked in disbelief, \"So, you’re saying that in such a short time, you’ve cultivated Heart of Woods in more than forty Forest Wolves? Not a single failure? They all awakened it!\"\nSu Ping nodded. \"Yes. Calculating it that way, the Cultivation success rate should theoretically be over ninety percent, right?\"\n\"Holy shit!?\"\nOld Su said nothing more. After swearing, he suddenly felt something was amiss.\nWhat was off?\nSoon, Su Anyong seemed to recall something and stared at Su Ping. \"You just said that these days you were cultivating Old Sha for Evolution?\"\nSu Ping nodded, feigning distress. \"Exactly! Didn’t I tell you before? It cost a lot of resources; all the money I earned went into it! Su Anyong, aren’t you well-off now? Aren’t you rolling in money? Old Sha is part of our family too, so it shouldn’t be a problem for you to chip in, right?\"\nClearly, his son’s smug, pretentious act practically screamed ’cocky and proud’ and ’I’m showing off’ all over his face.\nBut Su Anyong had no mind for anything else at that moment.\nMoney wasn’t his concern.\nWhen it came to Pet Beast Cultivation, significant sums of money were always involved; it wasn’t something small amounts could resolve.\nThus, his current bewilderment had nothing to do with money.\nEven if one could achieve Evolution merely by throwing money at it, Breeders wouldn’t be so valuable.\nIf this had been before,\nSu Anyong thought,\nand I’d heard such a thing—especially if this son of mine had dared to use Old Sha as an experiment for Evolution—I would have beaten Su Ping half to death.\nGoogle seaʀᴄh NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nBut now...\nThe business Lao Guan had mentioned, his own son’s claim of successfully cultivating Heart of Woods in dozens of Forest Wolves... all this seemed to lend immense credibility to Su Ping’s current words.\nHowever, something suddenly struck Su Anyong. \"You said before—what is Old Sha’s Evolutionary Body? It’s not a Forest Wolf, not an Elf Wolf, but a brand new, never-before-seen Evolutionary Body?\"\nThis time, Su Ping didn’t answer. He only smiled.\nThen, Su Anyong shot up, rushed past Lao Guan—who had just walked in—and bolted towards their backyard like a hundred-meter sprinter.\nSu Ping, meanwhile, rose leisurely, patted Xiao Qing, and then led the little creature at an unhurried pace towards the woods where the Forest Wolves were kept.\nBy the time Su Ping ambled from the front living room to the woods out back, Su Anyong, who had sprinted ahead, was already lying on the ground.\nOn top of him was Old Sha, whose appearance had changed drastically.\nBut despite its altered appearance, Old Sha undoubtedly still recognized Su Anyong clearly.\nIt had pounced, pinning him to the ground, its soft, seemingly plant-based tongue continuously licking Su Anyong’s cheeks.\nAt that moment, his father lay on the ground, letting Old Sha have its way. His brain seemed to have short-circuited; he was utterly bewildered, staring blankly at the creature before him.\nSu Ping wasn’t surprised by this scene in the slightest. Instead, he squatted beside his father’s head, rubbing Old Sha’s head. He looked at Su Anyong, who appeared to be in a dream, doubting his very existence, and finally said, \"Su Anyong, do you remember what you said in the car earlier?\"",

Su Anyong used his spiritual power to continuously check him. Whether it was physical Skills, intelligence, or the smooth flow of Old Sha’s own Energy, there wasn’t the slightest problem. Not only that, but the abundant Life force, which even he found astonishing, also seemed to prove it.\nHad Old Sha’s lifespan crisis truly been so easily resolved by his own son?\nHe looked at his son beside him, stroking Old Sha’s head.\nWithout any reason, Su Anyong suddenly felt an indescribable emotion. His son had been opinionated since he was little. Of course, growing up with a father like him, it was normal to have opinions. After all, truth be told, apart from finding Su Ping’s first Contracted Beast, Su Anyong felt he hadn’t truly fulfilled his responsibilities as a father. And now, in this short span of a month, Su Ping evoked a feeling in Su Anyong that he couldn’t quite describe. It was a feeling that every father has when they see their child achieve something extraordinary. Complex, unfamiliar, and of course, mostly pride. He had every right to be proud! Even within his understanding, how many people could boast achievements like his son’s? The perfected Magic Potion of Heart of Woods... a brand-new Forest Wolf Evolver. And it was right before his eyes—an Evolutionary Body whose strength and potential he fully acknowledged.\nSeeing his father’s gaze finally change slightly, Su Ping eventually couldn’t help but speak again, \"Does what you said earlier still count?\"\nSu Anyong finally snapped back to reality. Remembering what had just happened, he chuckled, \"I was just kidding with you, kid. You actually took your old man seriously?\"\nSu Ping nodded.\n\"Hey, hey, relax. Isn’t your old man’s stuff yours anyway? I’ll definitely give it to you, but I still need it right now...\"\nSu Ping shook his head.New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\n\"You’re at the age for studying; that thing’s too flashy...\"\nSu Ping remained expressionless.\nPleading in vain, Su Anyong finally exploded, \"You little rascal, don’t think you can overturn the heavens just because you’ve made a little progress!\"\nThe slap aimed at Su Ping’s head was blocked by a tree branch.\nOld Sha let out a clear AWOO from the side.\nOld Sha’s gaze was hesitant and complex. On one hand was Su Anyong, who had been with him the longest. On the other was his young master, Su Ping, who had also helped him evolve. It was really difficult for him to take sides! But no matter what, hitting someone is definitely wrong!\nSu Anyong sullenly withdrew his hand. Even if Old Sha hadn’t intervened, he wouldn’t have had the heart to truly strike him.\nNow, it seemed, the kid’s head was precious. What if he damaged it?\nSu Ping also hurriedly said from the side, \"We agreed earlier that if I really did it, you would give me your car.\"\nThat darn two-hundred-million-worth hovering sports car! How could the old coot drive something so expensive without worrying about throwing out his back! As such a filial son, Su Ping naturally had to relieve him of this heavy burden with gusto.\nUnfortunately, if Su Anyong could be so easily figured out, he wouldn’t be Su Anyong.\nFacing Su Ping’s excited gaze, Su Anyong said directly, \"From now on, you’re my dad, okay?\"\nSu Ping blinked, then glared furiously at Su Anyong, \"Su Anyong, are you really going to be a sore loser? Shamelessly going back on your word with your own son like this?\"\n\"What shameless tricks am I playing?\" Su Anyong sneered, arms crossed over his chest. \"Didn’t we agree before? If you could pull it off, I’d call you ’Dad.’ So? Now I’ve called you that, and you’re the one too scared to accept it, kid? As for the rest, hmph! Nothing!\"\nSu Ping was truly at a loss, glowering fiercely at the old man.\nHowever, Su Anyong seemed to suddenly get enthusiastic, \"Dad, hurry up and fetch your son a basin of water to wash my feet.\"\nSu Ping ignored him.\nThe old fellow was acting more and more undignified with age.\nHe simply went back into the house, leaving the old fellow to spend more time with Old Sha.\nWith his father back, Su Ping gave himself and his ’little ones’ a rare break, immediately entering meditation.\nHe had now reached the Common Tenth Level.\nHe was only a step away from the Elite Tier. Once he broke through to the Elite Level, he would be able to contract the Paperman and awaken the Space Characteristics, becoming a true Beast Tamer.\nSpeaking of which, among the Pet Beasts required for the Meditation Method Qin Xiaoxue had given him, the Paperman was indeed one of them.\nHowever, Su Ping suspected that any Beast Tamer who had the opportunity to access the Modu Advanced Academy’s Meditation Method would, under no circumstances, choose the Paperman as one of their other Contracted Beasts.\nSu Ping plunged into Darkness.\nAnd indeed, that was the case. Elsewhere, after Su Ping and Lao Guan had both left, Su Anyong finally composed himself. He then began to speak to Old Sha at his side, sharing words that only the two of them would truly understand:\n\"I truly never expected it. I tried so many methods back then, even helping you, Old Sha, break through your race limit, yet you still didn’t complete your Evolution. But this kid of mine actually did it.\"\n\"It’s just a shame I couldn’t personally accompany you through your Evolution. Seeing you like this now, I’m still not quite used to it.\"\n\"But... damn, you look so cool! It makes me kind of regret it. Back then, my old man tried to force me to contract a Forest Wolf as a Pet Beast. I refused, and he nearly broke my legs.\"",

He’s got an incredible grandson, stronger than me.\"\nAt this moment, Su Anyong spoke with an expression Su Ping had never seen before.\nJust as Su Ping had said before, Old Sha was their family member, and besides father and son, their closest one. Indeed, there were many things Su Anyong found difficult or embarrassing to say in front of Su Ping, so he would discuss them with Old Sha instead.\nAnd speaking of which, Su Anyong slowly extended his hand, a glow of light blossoming from his palm.\nThis was a very special stone. It was an emerald green color and, at first glance, looked a bit like the Sun Crystal. However, the light from the Sun Crystal was warm, whereas this stone radiated a green light that was immensely comforting. As soon as the object appeared, even the surrounding trees and flowers began to grow at a visible rate. This object was incredibly mystical.\nEven Old Sha’s gaze was involuntarily drawn to it.\n\"I went on that mission again for your sake and that brat’s, and I came back halfway through just for you. But now it seems you won’t be needing this anymore, will you?\"\nSeeing Old Sha’s reaction, Su Anyong smirked, \"How about that, hehe, regretting it now? That brat might be able to help you with Evolution, but this Essence of Nature is an Emperor Level resource. And to think I was always looking out for you, yet you still protected that brat! Unfortunately, now that you’ve undergone Evolution, you won’t get to enjoy this treat!\"\nWith a chuckle, Su Anyong placed the Essence of Nature back into the wooden box.\n\"AWOO...\"\nOld Sha nudged Su Anyong, who obviously understood and immediately teased, \"You rascal, has that brat completely bought you? Always siding with him whenever there’s something good, eh?\"\nBut Su Anyong clearly didn’t mind. What he said in front of his son was one thing, but what he truly thought was another. After all, who else would he give such good things to if not his own son?\n\"Don’t worry,\" Su Anyong continued, \"now that this thing’s been taken out, it can’t be put away. But that brat, in such a short time, managed to raise that mutant Little Forest Wolf to such a Realm, and even developed a new Forest Wolf Evolver. I just don’t know if this will still be needed by then!\"\nAt this point, Su Anyong thought about the ’slave’ contracts he had signed for this rascal. To think the brat had given him such a big surprise back home! He felt a mix of helplessness and relief.\n...\nThe sunlight was somewhat gloomy, but Zhang Lie breathed a slight sigh of relief as the gates came back into view.\nIndeed, after receiving an affirmative response from his superiors, Zhang Lie chose a few elite Beast Tamer soldiers with adequate military merits suitable for Cultivation and hurried back to Linzhou City without stopping.\nThis time, Zhang Lie hadn’t brought his son, as it was official business. Compared to his son’s task of Cultivating the Heart of Woods, this current matter seemed utterly trivial.\nThe Legion’s combat competition was of paramount importance. His old squad leader, as a favor from their past, had leaked the information to him in advance, so Zhang Lie naturally had to make arrangements early to extend the Cultivation time as much as possible.\nAfter all, there were only two months left! To describe it as racing against time was no exaggeration.\nThinking this, Zhang Lie ignored the ’Closed in the afternoon’ sign on the Heart of Woods’ plaque and directly rang the doorbell.\n\"Please state your business. This Cultivation base does not receive guests in the afternoon. If you wish for Cultivation, please visit tomorrow morning. Thank you.\"\n\"I’m Zhang Lie. I had an agreement with Breeder Su yesterday to discuss the Cultivation fee today...\"Googlᴇ search NovᴇlFirenᴇt\nBefore long, the door opened.\nAppearing before Zhang Lie was the familiar Manager Guan from yesterday. However, next to Manager Guan was not Su Ping, but a middle-aged man who bore some resemblance to Su Ping.\nThis man hadn’t appeared at all yesterday, which made Zhang Lie raise an eyebrow slightly. Inexplicably, he felt a very familiar sensation from this man.\n\"Please come in, Captain Zhang. Breeder Su is currently in meditation, but this is Breeder Su’s father. Anything you need to discuss can be addressed with him just the same!\"\nGuan Qianshan had also been present when Zhang Lie introduced himself yesterday, so he naturally knew Zhang Lie’s identity.\nHowever, he wasn’t aware of the subsequent details. But with Su Anyong present and his young boss, Su Ping, meditating, there was certainly no need to wake Su Ping. This was indeed the case.\nLeading Zhang Lie to the visitor’s room, Su Anyong looked at the man before him with some surprise. On the way, Lao Guan had already told him about this man’s identity.\nBut how on earth did his son get involved with a Beast Tamer troop?\nZhang Lie, on the other hand, didn’t doubt the man’s identity and even felt somewhat relieved.\nSu Ping was too young. Although he acted maturely and was highly capable, Zhang Lie always felt a twinge of guilt when discussing the Cultivation fees for military merit with him, as if he were taking advantage of a child. Now that an adult was here, it would be easier to discuss things. However, this thought had barely surfaced before it vanished. This was because the man before him, upon hearing what he and Su Ping had discussed yesterday, merely raised an eyebrow.",

Bringing in external Breeders for elite squad Cultivation?’ Interesting. Indeed, it seems that since the new leadership took over, significant headway has been made in implementing resource allocation for the Legions and various regions.\"\nWhat’s that supposed to mean?\nZhang Lie looked at the man before him with some suspicion.\nHowever, Su Anyong didn’t heed Zhang Lie’s gaze, simply smiled, and said, \"Are you talking about the reform in Cultivation expenses for the Legion? Then, for my son’s Cultivation fees, will it be Battle Merit Points or military merits?\"\nUpon hearing this, Zhang Lie’s heart tightened slightly.\nThis question, which seemed trivial, was, in fact, hitting right at the heart of the issue!\nBattle Merit Points are actually quite easy to obtain within the Legion; outstanding Beast Tamer soldiers, even those recognized as exemplary in cultural activities or hygiene, all earn Battle Merit Points! Even those with Advanced Level non-commissioned or commissioned officer ranks receive a certain amount of Battle Merit Points each month. Indeed, Battle Merit Points can be exchanged for many resources and special training, serving as the hard currency within the Legion.\nBut military merits are different!\nEvery military merit, even the lowest third-class merit, cannot be measured by anything else. Each merit represents a different meaning; military merits are one of the most important criteria for promotion within the Legion. Those sergeants who have improved their strength and Level but remain at the same rank are lacking in military merits!\nAt the same time, military merits come with many benefits within the Legion. These include discounts for exchanging Battle Merit Points for resources, access to acquiring High-level resource materials, and various advantages even for those no longer part of the Legion. Because military merits are not only valued within the Legion but are also greatly favored and come with intangible privileges in society.Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt\nPreviously, Zhang Lie had only talked about exchanging Battle Merit Points and never mentioned military merits.\nZhang Lie, who had previously breathed a sigh of relief, suddenly felt embarrassed and said, \"Well, there should be some. The commanding officer said this elite training will be involved in a future Legion competition! At that time, Breeders who perform well might be granted honorary military ranks.\"\nSu Anyong raised his eyebrows, his eyes lighting up. \"Honorary military ranks? What Level?\"\n\"This...\"\nZhang Lie was once again stuck for an answer and replied, \"The commanding officer didn’t say, and it hasn’t been decided from above yet. But since it’s an honorary rank, it must be at least at the Junior Officer Level.\"\n\"What damn good is that? You have plenty of those under your command. While an honorary rank does confer honor, that’s a bit too low.\" Su Anyong curled his lip.\n\"It can’t be said like that. An honorary rank is an honor, and no officer on duty, including myself, has any authority to command someone with one. It comes with benefits but no obligations. Besides, honorary ranks can be upgraded,\" Zhang Lie said with a somewhat sheepish smile.\nHe realized that Breeder Su’s father before him was no pushover. Most importantly, this man was extremely well-versed in many internal aspects of the Beast Tamer Legion!\nHe had come here full of confidence on a mission from his commanding officer, and now he hadn’t even discussed the use of Battle Merit Points when he was already stuck.\nIndeed, Su Anyong narrowed his eyes, looked at the somewhat helpless Zhang Lie, and then said, \"You want to entice my son with mere Battle Merit Points without knowing anything? Do you think the Heart of Woods has no one capable to speak for it? Have you forgotten the Legion’s bottom line and its principles? What happened to the mission entrusted to you?\"\nWithout giving Zhang Lie a chance to defend himself, Su Anyong waved his hand and said, \"Enough. Go inquire with your direct superiors first, then come back and we’ll talk.\"\nZhang Lie almost spat out a mouthful of old blood in frustration. He felt somewhat helpless and even started yearning for the Su Ping from yesterday.\nHowever, just as Regiment Commander Zhang Lie was about to stand up, Su Anyong seemed to remember something and took an item out of his jacket pocket. Then, he pinned it lightly on his chest and muttered to himself, \"Damn it, this thing actually has some use after all.\"\nZhang Lie turned his head back in astonishment, then his pupils slowly dilated, looking incredulously at the gleaming insignia.\nSu Anyong turned his head to look at Zhang Lie. At that moment, the man who, in Su Ping’s eyes, was usually an unreliable and eccentric father, wore an expression of unprecedented seriousness. He addressed Zhang Lie, saying, \"Regiment Commander Zhang, please be aware, this concerns the image of our Beast Tamer Legion in the hearts of the general public. Report to your superiors promptly, discuss it with them, and then return.\"\nZhang Lie’s body instantly tensed, and he saluted subconsciously, saying, \"Yes, Commander!\"",

In addition to Battle Merit Points, he’s also requesting a military decoration, and he’s not satisfied with the honorary military rank for Cultivation.\"\nUnder normal circumstances, Zhang Lie could have haggled with him. However, after seeing that glaring military insignia, he completely lost his nerve.Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\nThere was no way around it; who could stand firm when the other party spoke with the tone of a superior?\nHowever, it was clear that upon hearing this, Chief Lin on the other end of the phone suddenly became interested. \"How about this? I’m free right now. Start a video call, and I’ll chat with this comrade personally.\"\nUpon hearing this, Zhang Lie immediately breathed a sigh of relief. \"Thank you, Old Squad Leader!\"\nThe man’s presence was too strong, and with the disparity in military rank and status so evident, he truly felt overwhelmed.\nHe returned to the reception room.\nThe gleaming insignia on Su Anyong’s chest was incredibly shiny.\nSu Anyong glanced at him. \"Finished negotiating?\"\n\"Reporting, sir! Chief Lin said he would like to discuss this with you personally.\"\n\"Oh?\"\nWatching the phone placed before him, Su Anyong slightly raised his eyebrows as the figure appeared on the screen.\nHe naturally recognized the person’s identity.\n\"Lin Lei, Chief of the Eastern Forest Army’s Forest Wolf A Division. Greetings, comrade.\"\nSu Anyong nodded. \"Su Anyong. Hello, Chief Lin.\"\nHe didn’t say much more. This caused Chief Lin on the other end of the video to frown slightly, but Lin Lei didn’t pursue that line of conversation because Su Anyong had already started speaking. \"I’ve heard about your Legion’s situation. Battle Merit Points are indeed precious, but they alone are not enough! The potential of the Wanmu Wolf can’t be exchanged for just a few Battle Merit Points!\"\nDuring the afternoon, he hadn’t just been idly chatting with Old Sha; he had also been observing Old Sha showcase his abilities.\nThe results he witnessed were somewhat astounding.\nAlthough its direct attacking power was average and its attack Skills weren’t very intuitive, it was exceedingly versatile!\nEspecially its mutated Wood Body.\nIt was outrageously impressive.\nIn fact, what the Beastmaster Legion lacked most were precisely these kinds of all-around Pet Beasts, especially those without glaring weaknesses.\nMoreover, this was an Evolutionary Body capable of reaching Monarch Level Racial Potential.\nIf it were cultivated just for those few Battle Merit Points, Su Anyong felt Su Ping would be getting a raw deal.\nOf course, Old Sha’s Evolution potential was among the very best for Wanmu Wolves. Others might not necessarily evolve to the same degree.\nBut that didn’t stop Su Anyong from trying to leverage this to extract more benefits from the Legion.\nLin Lei spoke, \"Comrade, first, the level of the honorary military rank isn’t something I can decide. Even if Breeder Su successfully completes the Cultivation, he might not receive it. The standard for acquisition is achieving a rank in the Legion-wide competition for Breeders.\"\n\"General Zhao personally stated this, so I can’t promise you anything in this regard. Second, regarding military decorations, I can make you a promise there. However, it’s also conditional on achieving a sufficient rank. If the Forest Wolf Troop, with Breeder Su’s help, can secure a high enough ranking, a third-class merit won’t be a problem.\"\nLin Lei’s words were clear, but Su Anyong listened with utter boredom. Only when Lin Lei finished did Su Anyong speak. \"So, after all that talk, you’ve essentially said nothing? All empty promises?\"\n\"If my son finishes the Cultivation for your troop, and your troop’s Beast Tamers are incompetent, does that mean my son will have wasted his time and energy cultivating for those failures?\"\nAs soon as these words were spoken, Lin Lei’s expression turned somewhat grim.\nZhang Lie, who was sitting to the side, immediately stood up. If it weren’t for the military insignia on Su Anyong’s chest, he would have thrown a punch.\nA soldier can be killed but not humiliated!\nYet even so, he declared loudly, \"Report! The elite Beast Tamers of the Forest Wolf Troop are not failures!\"\nSu Anyong glanced at him and chuckled contemptuously.\n\"Comrade, please watch your words,\" Lin Lei said coolly. \"There are other Forest Wolf Breeders in Linzhou City, and even in Jianghai Province and the surrounding provinces.\"\nHe was clearly implying that Heart of Woods wasn’t the only option for cultivating Forest Wolves.\nSu Anyong, however, was unconcerned. He continued, \"Indeed, there are many. But the Wanmu Wolf is unique! Moreover, it’s an Evolutionary Body whose existence has never been publicly revealed. Its abilities, Cultivation effects, and combat methods are all unknown!\"\nIndeed, that was the true trump card.\nThe competition within the Legion this time was a serious, large-scale tournament, not just some trivial drill!\nIt was a coordinated tactical team competition involving several divisions and more than twenty regiment-sized groups from within the Legion.\nThis was all taking place before the entire Forest Wild Army.\nIf Lin Lei personally intervened, wasn’t it also because he wanted his own people to make a name for themselves in front of the entire army?\nBesides, this wasn’t just about showing off.\nIt was about tangible results!\nDuring the previous exercise between Forest Wolf A Division and Fierce Tiger C Division, one could argue it was because the other side had undergone elite Cultivation first. But if they were disgraced again this time, there would be no excuses.",

      "content": "Chapter 107: Chapter 101 Military Merit Rewards, Special Beastmaster Troops?_2\nUnder such circumstances, if the Forest Wolf Troop, which had suffered a great defeat before but had become surprisingly elite after completion of its cultivation, were to suddenly achieve something astounding, the significance would be completely different.\nSo, what did it mean when a new Evolutionary Body appeared—one that had never before been seen in the outside world, with an unknown origin and combat style, completely unfamiliar even to the veterans in the Legion?\nIt represented completely unknown intelligence, an absolute advantage, and priority in resource allocation!\nAt the same time, it also meant that this Pet Beast, the Forest Wolf, warranted the allocation of more resources and manpower.\nUnder such circumstances, as long as the capabilities of the Wanmu Wolf weren’t too disappointing, it would definitely be able to orchestrate a major surprise!\nNot to mention, according to Zhang Lie’s description, this Wanmu Wolf had already become the most comprehensive top-tier Forest Wolf Evolver.\nIt wasn’t just Zhang Lie who was itching with curiosity; Lin Lei was too. After all, as the Division Commander of the Battle Wolf A Division, he also had a damn Forest Wolf among his Pet Beasts! Although this Forest Wolf wasn’t his main combat Pet Beast, it hadn’t evolved yet!\nIf force doesn’t work, resort to gentleness.\nThinking of this, Lin Lei sighed,\n\"Comrade—no, Squad Leader, since you hold the same military rank as me, you should also know that I’m not at liberty to distribute military honors as I please. The division indeed has a quota of honors, but all the battalions from the Battle Wolf A Division will be participating in this competition!\n\"With so many battalions requesting them in advance, where would I find enough to give? If I give to one, what about the next one that comes asking? I also beseech you, Squad Leader, to trust our soldiers! Those who can pass the selection are definitely the elite of the elite! Perhaps Breeder Su himself would like to do the selection?\n\"How about this: if your troops indeed achieve a ranking—I daren’t say first place, but as long as it’s within the top five of the entire army—it would be reasonable for me to offer a second-class merit! You know a first-class merit isn’t realistic or possible, but a second-class is still feasible!\n\"Even if such high ranks aren’t achieved, after the event, I will still award a third-class merit. Although it’s true that for developing a brand new Evolutionary Body, if the Breeder were part of the Legion, it wouldn’t be difficult to receive a second-class merit. However, Breeder Su isn’t a member of the Legion. So, if it really comes to that, I must ask that you and Breeder Su not publicize this third-class merit...Google seaʀᴄh N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\n\"As for an honorary military rank, you should also know that even I don’t have the authority in that matter.\"\nThese words were spoken with sincerity and genuine emotion.\nSu Anyong gave a slight nod.\nA second-class merit!\nOf course, he knew this was indeed Lin Lei’s limit. He also knew that obtaining military honors as pure funding for cultivation before a battle was inherently difficult. This was precisely the outcome Su Anyong had been aiming for.\nThe Legion was a place where strength and achievements were paramount!\nOnly achievements could be persuasive; only the strong could distinguish themselves.\nWithout achievements, it was normal to gain nothing at all.\nSu Anyong’s early military experience had certainly taught him to acknowledge this.\nHe paused for a moment, then continued, \"If the Forest Wolf Troop achieves a top-five position, then in addition to the second-class merit you’ve promised, your division will have to grant another third-class merit!\"\n\"This... Alright!\"\nTop five, that will suffice! How many hidden dragons and crouching tigers are there in all the battalions of the entire army?\n\"Squad Leader, rest assured,\" Lin Lei said, thumping his chest in assurance, though he quickly added a caveat to avoid any grander demands. \"It’s not just General Zhao whose attention you’ve caught; people from the other Legions also want to see the results. In terms of resource cultivation, there definitely won’t be any problems! After all, the highest level for this competition is Commander Level, so excessively advanced cultivation resources won’t be needed!\"\nHe was truly intimidated by this ’Squad Leader.’\nHowever, upon seeing the smile on Su Anyong’s face, Lin Lei finally let out a sigh of relief.\n\"Alright. Whenever you have time, just send the people over quickly. I’ll be leaving in a couple of days and need to continue keeping an eye on my son during this time.\"\nDamn it!\nZhang Lie cursed inwardly.\nIf I had known this old fox who popped out of nowhere was leaving in a couple of days, I would have stalled for two days and brought it up then!\nLin Lei, however, paid no mind to these details. Instead, his eyebrows suddenly shot up, and he asked curiously, \"Squad Leader Su, to which faction do you belong? I’ve never heard of such an important figure like you in Linzhou before.\"\nIndeed, someone of his equivalent rank would be considered a significant figure in the local Legions.\nHowever, Su Anyong merely glanced at him, his expression turning serious once more as he stated flatly, \"Comrade Lin Lei, take note! According to confidentiality regulations, your position and rank do not grant you the authority to know this information! Furthermore, you are not permitted to disclose my military rank or military experience to regular Beast Tamers, including Su Ping!\"\n\"Uh...\" Lin Lei’s expression on the video call stiffened instantly.\n「The sun slowly set in the west.」\nFinally stepping out of the Heart of Woods, Zhang Lie heaved a long sigh and immediately redialed the number.\n\"Commander, what exactly is going on?\"\nLin Lei’s irritated voice came from the other end of the phone, \"What else could be happening? Either this person is an imposter struggling for an excuse—though that’s unlikely; the badge and his knowledge of the Legion’s inner workings don’t seem fake. Plus, it would be too easily exposed. Or, he’s a retired or even active member of the Special Beast Taming Forces!\"\nWithin the Legion, there were indeed Special Beast Taming Forces; Zhang Lie had heard of them.\nEach Special Beast Taming Force didn’t have many members.\nBut each member was very special, their identities kept confidential because the types of Pet Beasts they used were an absolute secret! This ensured they wouldn’t be targeted based on their Pet Beasts during future special missions.\nSince his enlistment, Zhang Lie had heard legends that within the Dragon Nation’s Beastmaster Legion, there was a most special beast-taming unit known as the Dragon Group.\nAll its members’ Pet Beasts belonged to the True Dragon lineage.\nThose members represented the top-tier, ace individual Beast Tamers of the Dragon Nation’s Beastmaster Legion!\nOf course, this was just a legend within the Legion.\n\"Alright, stop overthinking it. Your current mission is to bring those selected elites of the Forest Wolf Troop here to me. I’ve invested a lot in you on this! If you mess this up again, you’ll be sent to shovel dung on a farm! Do you hear me?\"\n\"Yes, sir! I guarantee I will complete the mission!\" Zhang Lie saluted subconsciously.\nOnly then did the call end with a satisfied click.\nStaring at the disconnected call, Lin Lei also sank into contemplation.\nSpecial Beast Taming Forces, huh?\nWho within the Beastmaster Legion hadn’t dreamed of joining one?\nOnce you joined, all your previous military records within the Legion would be hidden, your public record reverting to that of an ordinary person. But in reality, every Beast Tamer in a Special Beast Taming Force was an absolute ace within the Legion.\nTypically, the name of a Special Beast Taming Force would have some connection to the primary Pet Beasts they employed. Therefore, the name of any Special Beast Taming Force within the Legion was an absolute secret!\nAlthough members of the Special Beast Taming Forces weren’t necessarily officer class, in such units, military rank held an even more special significance. All ranks were earned through strength and accumulated merits!\nAfter all, Blue Star was a Beast Master Civilization, and a powerful Beast Tamer could sway the outcome of a considerably large-scale war.\nLin Lei felt a surge of emotion.\nEvery Special Beast Taming Force constantly faced life-and-death situations. Each member was truly elite, tempered through all sorts of perilous environments.\nThese things were too far removed for an ordinary Beast Tamer in the Beastmaster Legion. Only those with exceptional talent, true one-in-ten-thousand seedlings, would be directly selected after enlistment.\nClearly, this Squad Leader Su must be such a person.\nHowever, Chief Lin, currently full of wild thoughts about Su Anyong, would never imagine the truth. He envisioned Squad Leader Su as a powerful, mysterious, retired or even active Beast Tamer from a special force. In reality, this same Squad Leader was squatting at the doorstep of a side room in his own home. He listlessly puffed on a cigarette, bewilderedly watching a small Paperman inside. The Paperman waved a paper sword around its waist and glared with its eyes. Witnessing this, Su Anyong once again found himself doubting the meaning of life.",

      "content": "Chapter 108: Chapter 102: Satisfying Catalog Experience, The Mystery of Paperman!\n\"Why does it feel like the decades I’ve spent here in the Heart of Woods have been less thrilling than your one month, kid?\"\nSu Anyong watched the little Paperman in the distance and listened to Su Ping’s words, which seemed to relate to the Secret Realm. He took a drag of his cigarette, exhaled a smoke ring with some annoyance, and watched it slowly drift up into the sky.\n\"So you’ve perfected our ancestral breeding and Evolution method, accidentally developed a new Pet Beast Evolution method, and even discovered that there’s a Secret Realm on our own little patch of land? What else have you done this month?\"\nSu Ping opened his mouth but didn’t mention Qin Xiaoxue. As a proud man, he naturally found it embarrassing to admit to being supported by a woman.\nSo he awkwardly changed the subject. \"What do you know about the Secret Realm, and what do you think of it?\"\n\"Don’t you know it all? It’s a Beast Taming Space left by a group of ancient, powerful Beast Tamers. Some were left unintentionally after their deaths, while others were purposefully arranged to leave behind a legacy,\" Su Anyong said indifferently. \"Of course, the value of a Secret Realm is undeniable. So, when the time comes, you can choose whether to develop it alone or cooperate with other organizations.\"\n\"Eh?\" Su Ping gave his father an odd look. \"You’re not staying to work on it with me?\"\nSu Anyong shook his head. \"I still have unfinished business in Beihai City; your stepmother is waiting for me there. I came back this time just to see how you and Old Sha were managing, since it’s your first time in charge. But now it seems I was overthinking it.\"\nIndeed, he had overthought it. Su Anyong felt that, without him, the Heart of Woods seemed more prosperous than ever before.\nCould it be that he had been hindering the development of the Heart of Woods all these years?\nSu Anyong questioned his life choices.\nPerhaps he should have been under the car, not inside it.\nPushing down the speechlessness in his heart, Su Anyong’s gaze returned to the little Paperman, and his eyes narrowed slightly. \"Are you thinking of contracting this little thing as your second Pet Beast?\"\nSu Ping nodded as if it went without saying.\n\"This little Paperman is indeed a bit strange. As you said, it can freely enter and exit that Secret Realm. I suspect it’s directly connected to that Secret Realm. Plus, it has developed a Metal Element Mutation. But...\"\n\"But what?\" Su Ping looked at Su Anyong.\nHis father’s expression was serious. \"Papermen are known as the disgrace of the Necromancy Series. Do you know why?\"\nSu Ping nodded. \"Because they’re weak.\"\n\"Weak, of course. But you need to understand just how weak! It’s not just weak; it’s utterly lacking in potential!\"\nSu Ping looked at Su Anyong, waiting for him to continue.\nSu Anyong elaborated, \"Papermen have only one Racial Skill: Paper Body Folding. It’s a trivial skill that allows them to freely alter their physical form. Other than that, they have no other Racial Skills. As a Breeder, you should understand the implications of this.\"\nSu Ping’s brows slowly knitted together.\nHe certainly grasped the meaning behind Su Anyong’s words.\nRacial Skills dictate their corresponding development and even affect Evolution pathways. Vice President Liu had made this crystal clear in his class. The growth of Skills is crucial for deciding the direction of Cultivation and possible evolutionary paths. Having few foundational Racial Skills naturally means that research into evolutionary paths would likely revolve around just that one skill, which presents an enormous challenge.\nHowever, his frown wasn’t just about that.\nIt was for a simple reason.\nIn the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, the Racial Skills listed for the Paperman included not only Paper Body Folding but another skill: Paper Body Joint!\nHe looked at Su Anyong suspiciously. \"All Papermen have only this one skill? There are no others?\"\n\"Of course, there are exceptions. Take your variant, for instance; it’s already quite something for it to have that absurd Jinge Technique and other cultivated Skills. But unlike the Forest Wolf, which has four Racial Skills, a Paperman typically has only one.\"\nReally?\nSu Ping had been too busy lately to pay much attention to the Cultivation of the little Paperman or Papermen in general. He simply let it continue practicing its Swordsmanship and the Jinge Technique, coupled with Rapid Casting.\nSo his knowledge of Papermen was still at a very basic level.\nWas the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas wrong? Did Papermen truly lack a so-called Paper Body Joint Racial Skill? After all, even his own father said so! But that couldn’t be possible! No sooner had this thought emerged than Su Ping snuffed it out in its infancy.\nHowever, at this moment, Su Ping was truly curious about the Paperman, this weak yet special Undead Pet Beast.\nSu Anyong didn’t notice the change in Su Ping’s expression and continued, \"So, if you want to contract this creature, it’s best to assess the situation within that Secret Realm first. To my knowledge, the evolutionary channels for Papermen are average at best. Even the race limit of their evolved species doesn’t exceed Elite Sixth Rank.\"nᴇt\nSu Anyong didn’t directly advise Su Ping to give up on contracting the little Paperman.\nIn his view, even as a variant, this Paperman simply couldn’t compare to the Forest Wolf.\nAs for the Secret Realm, while precious, no treasure within could be more important than a contract slot for his son’s Pet Beast.\nBut he knew his son all too well: Su Ping was decisive and had his own ideas. All Su Anyong could do was present the facts and his own experience as supporting arguments.",

Instead, he looked at the little Paperman in the corner of the garden, tirelessly practicing its swordplay, and chuckled, its two-dimensional facial expressions constantly changing.\n\"But I must say, this little thing is quite interesting. It’s a shame that I don’t have time; otherwise, I’d really want to stay and see what kind of Secret Realm could give birth to such a trinket.\nAlright, you should rest early. I reckon that guy from the Beast Tamer Corps will bring people over tomorrow. I’ve boasted about you quite a bit, so don’t you dare embarrass me, kid!\"\nSu Ping rolled his eyes at Su Anyong.\nHe already knew about Zhang Lie’s arrival and had no objections to his father making deals with the other party. Although the old man wasn’t always reliable, Su Ping trusted his knack for shameless tactics.Follow current novels on ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nSu Ping wasn’t in a hurry. He continued to train the other Forest Wolves for a while and also worked on mathematical permutations and combinations with Old Sha before finally returning to his room.\n「The night slowly passed.」\nIn the early morning, the oppressive heat of the \"autumn tiger\" spread unabashedly after dawn.\nSu Anyong had been right.\nEarly the next morning, figures stood at attention in the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base.\nBesides Zhang Lie, there were a full ten of them!\nEach one stood tall and firm, possessing a resolute air. However, an irrepressible curiosity gleamed in their eyes and expressions as they observed the place where they were to carry out this special, secret mission.\nThese ten were the elite, handpicked by Zhang Lie from the Forest Wolf Troop.\nAmong them were veterans, while others were already officers at the company or battalion commander level.\nHowever, this grand competition was a reform-oriented contest for the entire Forest Wild Army, conducted by temporarily formed tactical teams.\nNaturally, there was no need to distinguish between positions and ranks.\nAs long as they were elites, anyone could participate.\nSu Ping had just opened the door when he was startled by the scene before him.\n\"Good morning, Breeder Su!\"\nThe resonant greeting shattered the morning calm, completely dispelling any lingering sleepiness Su Ping had.\nHe glanced wordlessly at Zhang Lie, who stood to the side with a smile, and said, \"So early?\"\n\"Breeder Su, it couldn’t be helped. Your father must have told you. This concerns the major competition within the Legion; every second counts. So, we have to trouble you. Rest assured, if you have any resource requirements, please state them directly. Also, the Battle Merit Points earned for each individual you cultivate will be transferred to you!\"\nZhang Lie had brought quite a few people, far more than the five required, but this was actually reasonable.\nFirstly, evolutionary cultivation had a chance of failure. What if too many failed, and they couldn’t gather five successful ones? Besides, bringing more people also gave Su Ping more options for selection, didn’t it?\nSu Ping yawned. \"No need to rush; there’s still plenty of time!\"\nIndeed, there was plenty of time. If they hadn’t arrived so early, I wouldn’t have even bothered to get up and meet them. I actually have more important things to do this morning.\nBut now, Su Ping had no choice but to force himself to be alert and face these ten Beast Tamer soldiers, who were clearly from the Legion.\n\"Everyone, summon your Forest Wolves first!\"\nAlthough Old Sha has only just evolved, an opportunity to further my research on the Wanmu Wolf has practically landed in my lap. However, Father also told me yesterday that if I could help this Forest Wolf Troop achieve good results, I would also receive a considerable reward. Honorary military ranks and Battle Merit Points... those are quite tempting. So, I really can’t afford to be careless with this.\nThe most important criterion was the Sunlight Absorption Skill Level of the Forest Wolves to be cultivated! This was the most crucial standard for measurement. In the evolution of a Wanmu Wolf, the Skill Level of Sunlight Absorption determined its potential after the evolution was complete.\nTo achieve good results, at the very least, Forest Wolves whose Sunlight Absorption skill was merely at the Proficient Level had to be absolutely excluded.\nAt Su Ping’s command, dazzling lights flared up. Su Anyong also came to stand behind Su Ping, remaining silent as he watched his son make the selections.\nThis should be a simple step,\nSu Ping thought.\nJust use the Eye of Truth to check the Rank of these Forest Wolves.\nSoon, Su Ping realized he was mistaken. He had originally assumed that ten people would mean ten Forest Wolves. But he discovered he still didn’t understand the Beast Tamer Legion well enough.\nThese elite Beast Tamers from the Forest Wolf Troop each had, on average, two Forest Wolves. A few even summoned a third, clearly indicating they were Commander Level Beast Tamers.\nSu Ping strained his Eye of Truth until his own eyes turned red, finally inspecting all twenty-odd Forest Wolves.\nTo be fair, Zhang Lie wasn’t wrong. The ones he brought are indeed elites from the Forest Wolf Troop. Among these twenty-odd Forest Wolves, almost every one has reached its peak. Two of them, just like Old Sha, have even broken through their race limit. They’ve reached Commander First Stage. They clearly achieved this breakthrough by consuming some exceptionally potent resources.\nOf the ten Forest Wolves Su Ping selected, eight had Sunlight Absorption at the Mastery Level. One of them—specifically, one of those that had broken its race limit—had achieved the Perfection Level, just like Old Sha. The last one, however, was only at the Proficient Level.\nJust as Zhang Lie had said, the elite team’s battles only required five members; the other five were reserves, just in case.\nSu Ping also naturally wanted to observe firsthand the difference in potential among Wanmu Wolves evolved with Sunlight Absorption at the Proficient, Mastery, and Perfection Levels. This would allow him to further refine his understanding of the Wanmu Wolf Evolver.\n\"Alright, leave these Forest Wolves here. You all can go about your business and check on their status periodically. Troop Leader Zhang, I’ll give you a list of the required resources shortly. Let’s officially start the cultivation in about two days.\"\nSu Ping waved his hand. After selecting the Forest Wolves to be left behind, and with Old Sha and his own father present, he wasn’t worried about any problems arising.\nAny Forest Wolf, in Old Sha’s presence, would have to behave as meekly as a husky anyway.\nThe involvement with the Legion was an unexpected interlude. While he estimated it would be his main source of income for the foreseeable future, Su Ping wouldn’t let it delay his own important matters. Old Sha’s success was sufficient proof of the completeness and correctness of the Wanmu Wolf cultivation method. He naturally no longer needed to monitor them as obsessively, neglecting food and sleep, as he had before.\nWith that said, Su Ping quickly returned to his room and lay down again.\nSu Anyong looked at the bewildered Zhang Lie and then said, \"Troop Leader Zhang, don’t mind him; this kid gets really grumpy when he wakes up. Alright, leave the Forest Wolves, and bring the necessary resources in two days. Also, would you like to stay for breakfast?\"\n\"Alright, alright. Then we’ll be troubling Breeder Su! Breakfast won’t be necessary, thank you.\"\nZhang Lie then departed directly with his men.\nBefore departing, however, he and all the elite members of the Forest Wolf Troop couldn’t help but cast a longing glance at Old Sha, who had appeared nearby.\nIs that the Evolutionary Body cultivated by Breeder Su? This Kylin-like Forest Wolf Evolver! It’s truly captivating! Could our Forest Wolves also become like that in the future? We’re really looking forward to it.\nSu Ping would naturally be grumpy if awakened from a pleasant dream, but his rush to return to his room just now clearly wasn’t because of that. The reason was simple: earlier this morning, the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas had already provided feedback:\n[You spent a day in close companionship with two Forest Wolves. Your Forest Wolf Catalog Experience +80 points.]\n[Current Forest Wolf Catalog Experience: (2015/2000). Experience Points meet the Catalog’s upgrade requirements. Upgrade now?]\nThe upgrade experience for the Forest Wolf Catalog was finally sufficient!",

      "content": "Chapter 110: Chapter 103 Forest Wolf Catalog LV3, Mind’s Eye!\nThe Forest Wolf Catalog, as the first Catalog to be illuminated from the awakening of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, is also currently the only one that Su Ping has cultivated in depth.\nSu Ping had long experienced the effects of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas. Moreover, the connected sharing Ability of the Forest Wolf Catalog, after its upgrade to Level 2, was already incredibly overpowered.\nNow, after a month of accumulation, the Forest Wolf Catalog finally reached the limit of its Experience Points once again.\nSu Ping didn’t hesitate for a moment. At the first sign of feedback from the Catalog, he immediately made his decision:\nYes!\nIn an instant, a light shone forth from the Forest Wolf Catalog, even more dazzling than the last time it had improved.\nAt the same time, the card, which was originally green as its base color, deepened in hue at this moment.\nA color blending indigo with sky blue spread over the surface of the Forest Wolf Catalog card.\nSoon after, as if purging all impurities, this spot of blue expanded. In no time, the Forest Wolf Catalog, originally Level 2, transformed from green to the current blue.\nThis also proved that the upgrade of the Forest Wolf Catalog’s Level was complete!\n[Catalog ’Forest Wolf’ Level upgraded, current Catalog Level: 3, Origin reward acquired: Mind’s Eye Vision (Forest Wolf)]\nAbove the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, after the Forest Wolf Catalog had completely transformed into blue, an Origin feedback appeared in the depths of Su Ping’s mind.\nAs expected, the reward for leveling up the Forest Wolf Catalog this time was not another boost to his innate Talent or anything else. This was just like when it was raised to Level 2.\nInstead, it was a special Origin Ability that only worked on the Forest Wolf group.\nIf one had to say, it was also a kind of special Talent, except it was a special derivative Talent born from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas.\nThe effectiveness of the previous connected sharing needed no further elaboration.\nNot to mention, during this past month of training, one of his own Forest Wolves had even broken through to Mastery Level with its Skills. This was all thanks to the incredible effects and power of connected sharing.\nAnd Su Ping believed that the reward from leveling up the Catalog to Level 3 would not disappoint him.\nThe next moment, this Ability called Mind’s Eye Vision manifested in Su Ping’s mind.\n[Mind’s Eye Vision (Forest Wolf): A distinct Ability derived from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas. It enables the vision of Forest Wolves with sufficient intimacy level to be shared with themselves and optionally with other Forest Wolves. Additionally, one can give orders to the Forest Wolves employing connected sharing through Mind’s Eye Vision!]\n[Note 1: If Forest Wolves rashly share their vision, it can lead to maladjustment, thus affecting their combat Abilities.]\n[Note 2: At the current Realm, a maximum of 20 Forest Wolves can be connected at the same time.]\nThis Ability?\nAt first glance, this Ability seemed less overpowered than the previous connected sharing, but his heart was filled with unimaginable joy.\nHe had an idea back when he first battled against the Zhang Family Brothers at Yun Tian’s training grounds. Others might control a single Pet Beast, or a few at most, for battle. However, with the Talent of Pet Beast Home, he could carry and command a large number of Pet Beasts in combat. But this was just a thought. After all, Beast Tamers in history had gained the Talent Skill of Pet Beast Home, but how many were able to command a group of beasts in battle? Wolf Pets and insect pets performed best because wolf packs have Wolf Kings, and insect swarms have queens. In theory, by controlling one, a Beast Tamer could command the whole group under certain circumstances. But theory was theory, and reality was reality. The truth was, unless it was just a minor skirmish, such a situation was hard to achieve. The primary reason was the lack of coordination between the Beast Tamer and the beast group. There was also a delay in the transfer of commands. And now, this issue seemed like it could be easily resolved?\nSu Ping’s current Realm was Common Tenth Level. Similar to the Forest Wolf connected sharing, it could directly affect twenty wolves.\nIn other words, he could now ’micromanage’ twenty connected Forest Wolves in combat and training!\nWhat concept is this?\nQuite simply, it was like the god-like perspective in an RTS (real-time strategy) game versus an opponent’s 3D first-person perspective. The difference didn’t need to be spelled out by Su Ping.\nWhile connected sharing further nurtured the Forest Wolf’s Skills, this Mind’s Eye Vision cultivated their ability to fight as a group.\nAlmost the instant his thought stirred, Su Ping felt twenty small perspectives emerge on his mental screen.\nThese twenty small perspectives were from the twenty Forest Wolves with whom he was sharing a Spiritual Connection!\nHe even felt he could transmit his commands into the minds of any of these twenty Forest Wolves.\n「Behind the courtyard.」\nIn front of the woods, Old Sha stood before the ten Forest Wolves. The Wolf King Majesty made eight of them tremble, looking at Old Sha in fear. Only the other two, Commander Level Forest Wolves that had broken through Elite Level and also possessed the Wolf King Majesty skill, could offer some resistance. But it was only minimal.\nOld Sha looked at the ten obedient Forest Wolves, his two small seedling-like horns swaying slightly, clearly very satisfied.",

      "content": "Chapter 111: Chapter 103 Forest Wolf Catalog LV3, Mind’s Eye!_2\nHowever, at this moment, a voice suddenly spoke in Old Sha’s heart, \"Old Sha, go get some tree fruits for these Forest Wolves—five for each of the eight Elite Level ones, and ten for each of the two Commander Level wolves!\"\nAWOO?!\nOld Sha blinked, a hint of confusion showing in his verdant pupils.\nHad the training from his young master these past couple of days been too much, leaving him short on rest? Why did it seem like he could hear his young master’s voice and command? And why was the command so utterly detestable to him? Math, of all things, was the most hated! He must have heard wrong! Yes, that’s it!\nOld Sha shook his head, shifting his scrutinizing gaze back to the little ones his young master was cultivating.\nHowever, just as he had done so, that voice rang out once again: \"Hurry up, get the tree fruits, or otherwise soon you’ll have to redistribute the tree fruits to all the Forest Wolves!\"\nOld Sha shivered and, under the astonished stares of the group of Forest Wolves before him, he rushed to the cabin nearby and grasped a huge barrel of tree fruits in his jaws.\nIt was so strange, how on earth did his young master do this?\nHow it was done, Old Sha didn’t know, but what he did know was that if he didn’t follow through, he might have to start that nightmarish permutation and combination task again.\nWatching Old Sha’s actions through his Mental Vision, Su Ping nodded in satisfaction.\nThis ability was indeed extremely magical!\nSu Ping then tried to overlay one Forest Wolf’s training perspective on top of Old Sha’s vision.\nAnd indeed, Old Sha’s movements faltered a little. But he adapted quickly.\nThis sensation was like slacking off at work while simultaneously playing chess. Two other perspectives appeared in his mind: one was his own immediate field of vision, and the other was like watching the other Forest Wolves through a screen.\nIf any situation arose on the other end while sharing this Mental Vision, the other connected Forest Wolves could discover it instantly.\nHowever, after only a short try, Su Ping decided not to continue. Instead, he quickly summarized some key points about this Mental Vision in his mind.\nThe most important and universal aspect of the ability was having more thorough control over the connected and shared Forest Wolves; he could even try to have them act as commanders in group combat.\nMicro-managing twenty Forest Wolves.\nHe could issue commands from a distance through this ability.\nHowever, sharing the Mental Vision among the Forest Wolves was not to be used carelessly. It was quite uncomfortable for the wolves.\nPerhaps, for human Beast Tamers, watching additional perspectives in their spirit—much like monitoring screens—was difficult. Moreover, the intelligence of the Forest Wolves was not on par with humans.\nOnly Old Sha could somewhat adapt to the shared vision of a few Forest Wolves. Others, even while running, would often lose concentration and smash directly into tree stumps.\nIf they couldn’t adapt, using this ability in battle would clearly be suicidal.\nNevertheless, as the Cultivation of the Forest Wolves progressed and their Levels increased, it should get much better.\nThinking this, Su Ping let out a long breath, then ceased concentrating his spiritual power and opened his eyes.\nThen, an unprecedented sense of exhaustion came over him, making Su Ping realize that this Mental Vision ability was not something even he could use casually.\n...\n「Two or three days passed quickly.」\nIt had been several days since Su Anyong returned, and today was the day of his departure.\nThere was no sorrow; neither father nor son were prone to sentimentality. If Su Ping had to describe his feelings, it was more like resentment.\nYes, this old coot was leaving, and he still hadn’t left the \"Super Shadow\" behind.\nThat Mechanical Core intelligent sports car, worth over two hundred million on the market, remained beyond Su Ping’s reach.\nAnd Su Ping regretted it greatly.\nAfter obtaining it for himself, he could sell it and add some money to buy that intelligent extraction machine. At that time, he could resume the unfinished Wolf Tobacco research.\nIt was a pity, though, that the old man guarded it more closely than his own nest egg, let alone allowing Su Ping to fiddle with it. It was usually kept in the Beast Taming Space, and Su Ping wasn’t even given the chance to touch it.\nDamn it, I’ll get one that’s even cooler, flashier, and more badass in the future, to make this old coot green with envy!\nHowever, after looking at the small wooden box in the Beast Taming Space, Su Ping let out a sigh.\nLet it go, let it go. For the sake of this item, I’ll forgive the old man.\nPreviously, he had heard from Qin Xiaoxue that when Woodhead evolved into the Crown Wolf Emperor, it required two main core materials.\nOne was Natural Essence, the other was the Thorny Crown.\nHe didn’t understand what the latter was yet, but Natural Essence was undoubtedly an Emperor Level resource.\nHowever, Su Ping had never imagined that in less than a month, he would come into contact with this Natural Essence, especially through his own father.\nThis was the treasure that Su Anyong had originally planned to bring back to prolong Old Sha’s life.\nNow that Old Sha had completed his Evolution, he obviously did not need it anymore, so Su Anyong gave it to Su Ping instead.\nThis undoubtedly made Su Ping speculate further about the old man’s identity.\nHe had never doubted that his father had secrets and strength.\nAfter all, his grandfather had been a Monarch Level Beastmaster in that era. Unless his father was truly an incompetent good-for-nothing... But then again, while Su Anyong was often unreliable and whimsical, Su Ping had never seen him suffer any grievances, act weak, or spend his days merely eating, drinking, and making merry.\nHowever, speculation was just speculation.\nHe didn’t ask further because if Su Anyong didn’t want to share, there was no point in asking. He would just be brushed off and treated like a fool, as he had been in the car.\nHe had boasted a little to the old man over the phone about his achievements. He wanted to let him know that he, Su Ping, having awakened his Beast Tamer Talent and become a true Beast Tamer, was no longer the helpless kid he used to be.\nIn the past few days, Su Ping also shared some plans for the future development of the Heart of Woods with Su Anyong.\nExpand the area! Broaden the industry! Increase the Cultivation of other Pet Beasts, especially putting the Cultivation of Pet Beasts from the Plant System and aquatic types on the agenda!\nSu Anyong had no particular reaction, just one sentence over and over, \"Whatever you do, Dad supports you! But, there’s no money!\"\nAs for selling the sports car? Was the kid really talking about selling a sports car? That was his, Su Anyong’s, life!\nSu Ping simply stopped bothering with him afterwards.\nIn these two days, he had familiarized himself as much as possible with the use of Mental Vision. He had also further planned the Cultivation of those ten Forest Wolves and finally determined the scope of their development for the coming days.Follow current novᴇls on ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nBesides, there were two noteworthy things that happened during these two days.\nFirst, the next-door Yuntian Resort came over again. However, it wasn’t the previous Manager Qian or Dong Muyun; it was someone else, proposing to develop the unknown Secret Realm with Su Ping.\nHowever, Su Ping neither rejected nor agreed to the proposal.\nLately, Old Sha could clearly feel the ripples of space becoming more frequent on the banks of the Lingxi River. This wasn’t due to the comings and goings of the little Papermen; rather, the gate to that Secret Realm was probably about to appear.\nHe would wait and see what the deal with that Secret Realm was before deciding; it wouldn’t be too late.\nSecond, was what was happening right in front of him at this moment.\nAfter Su Ping’s promotion to Common Tenth Level, Xiao Qing’s Realm also reached Common Ninth Rank.\nAnd over these many days, Xiao Qing, as the prime beneficiary of the ’Link Share’ ability, along with the breakthrough of his Sunlight Absorption Skills to the Proficiency Level, had his Realm rise with the tide!\nHe had reached Common Tenth Level! Once again on par with Su Ping!\nSu Ping had already planned that in a few days, once Xiao Qing’s Realm had stabilized, he would give him the Elite Level Poison System Resource, the Devil’s Willow Leaf, to consume, hoping he could break through to the Elite Level in one go!\nOnce the Pet Beast broke through, it might also lead to his own breakthrough of the Elite Level threshold.\nAfter all, with the Stone of Creation and many previous resources, Su Ping could feel that his spiritual power was also constantly improving, reaching an exciting juncture.\nAnd meanwhile, over these past two days, the resources Su Ping had asked Zhang Lie to prepare had finally been delivered into his hands.",

      "content": "Chapter 112: Chapter 104 Su Ping’s Farming Blueprint! No More Money!\nHerb juices, Wood Spirit Grass, Smiling Sunflower Seeds, Sunlight Spring Water, Breath of Nature... These were the resources Su Ping needed to cultivate his Pet Beasts.\nHowever, what was delivered at this moment was more than just these.\nIn addition to two precious Sun Crystals, there were items like Elf Leaves, Fruits of Life, Hearts of Wood Marrow, and a pile of resources with Wood and Life Attributes.\nThey were brought in by a small truck!\nThey were sent into his own cultivation base.\nAs Zhang Lie had said, generally, the resources needed for Cultivation would not all be delivered at once to an ordinary Breeder.\nBut he believed in himself and also in Heart of Woods.\nAll things considered, flattery never fails.\nSu Ping was quite satisfied with the efficiency of the Legion’s handling of affairs.\nConcerning the Cultivation and Evolution of those ten Wanmu Wolves, Su Ping had already made plans.\nAccording to the previous agreement, if the Wanmu Wolves placed in the subsequent Legion contests, he would receive a third-class merit. Additionally, he would gain a second-class military honor.\nAnd that honorary military title.\nAlthough Su Ping did not fully understand the specific uses of these accolades,\nthey sounded rather nice.\nNaturally, to ensure these little guys would not embarrass him in two months, Su Ping was determined to do his utmost!\nFirst and foremost was the Cultivation of Heart of Woods.\nHeart of Woods, Sunlight Absorption, Photosynthesis—Su Ping had yet to completely understand the special formula these three Skills combined to create.\nBut without a doubt, as evidenced by Old Sha’s performance, they could form a cyclical system.\nThis was crucial for increasing combat effectiveness.\nTherefore, even though Heart of Woods was not among the Wanmu Wolf’s Racial Skills, Su Ping had still placed the Wood Heart Skill at the core of their skill set.\nIt was just a pity that after Old Sha’s Heart of Woods reached the Master Level, advancing it further became extremely difficult.\nEven when connected with other Forest Wolves, practicing the Wood Heart Skill proficiently was quite troublesome.\nAfter briefly planning the upcoming Cultivation time, Su Ping already had an estimate in mind.\nHe would start by cultivating Heart of Woods. Then, in about ten days, he would begin formally evolving these Legion Forest Wolves into Wanmu Wolves.\nOld Sha’s Evolution took about less than half a month.\nThis time, the Cultivation period was only two months.\nAfter Su Ping cultivated Heart of Woods, he also wanted to improve the Sunlight Absorption Skills of some Legion Forest Wolves. This way, the resulting Wanmu Wolves would have stronger potential and strength.\nHowever, once the Cultivation was complete, he had to reserve at least a week. Su Ping intended to train the Wanmu Wolves in combat, allowing the evolved Wanmu Wolves to adapt to their new Abilities.\nLooking at the precious resources stored in the Magic Potion workshop, Su Ping let out a sigh.\nIt’s unfortunate. It’s fine to use these things myself; even asking for more based on this usage isn’t a big deal. But if I were to \"fleece\" the Legion and then turn around to sell these goods, the nature of the matter would be entirely different. Never mind what the Legion might think; my own father would definitely have an opinion.\nConsequently, Su Ping was actually quite troubled.\nI’m out of money!\nOld Sha’s Evolution had exhausted the savings he had accumulated over this period, but he had many areas where he currently needed money.\nLao Guan had already negotiated with those around Heart of Woods. All the deeds for the land along both sides of Lingxi River had been agreed upon, and even the small hillside south of the river had been settled. As long as Su had the money, the contract could be signed at any time!\nThen, the land area of Heart of Woods could be expanded at least twofold.\nThis twofold expansion wasn’t just doubling the current area of the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base; instead, it encompassed the entirety of Heart of Woods along with the Yuntian Resort. One could only imagine the scale.\nAfter all, apart from some storefronts near the road with some foot traffic, the space at the back was a desolate land rarely trodden by human feet.\nSu Ping intended to build a bridge on his property at this Lingxi River location. This bridge would link both sides of the river belonging to Heart of Woods. He also planned to draw in river water to create a small lake.\nMeanwhile, the small barren hill to the south would serve as a large botanical garden for cultivating Plant-based Pet Beasts.\nAnd to the west of Lingxi River, he would see if he could carve out a special, fully enclosed area to raise some Undead Pet Beasts.\nYun Tian would still maintain the resort. Even though it was on the outskirts of the city, it was still along the street, so certain aesthetics had to be maintained.\nWhen that time came, the Yuntian Resort would connect with the entirety of Heart of Woods. Complemented by several nearby storefronts, it would act as a one-stop service station for Pet Beast Cultivation, vacationing, and combat.\nThe space behind, with the Forest Wolf forest, the Lingxi River location, and the barren hill to the south, would become the Cultivation grounds for Pet Beasts. This was the preliminary plan.\nLao Guan had also calculated the costs for Su Ping.\nThe issue with the land deeds wasn’t too bad. If it was only the area south of Lingxi River and the barren hill, the deeds would cost only about twenty million yuan to secure.\nAfter all, it was undeveloped wasteland with no development value.\nHowever, excluding Heart of Woods and Yuntian Resort, the other deeds near them along the street were not so cheap.",

Out of Money!_2\nOf course, there was no need to rush this particular matter for now.\nHowever, while buying and fencing off land might not be expensive, the renovations certainly were!\nSu Ping wanted to dig lakes and build bridges on his own property.\nTo say nothing of other things, wouldn’t roads need to be paved to connect everything? Weren’t special fences required to prevent Pet Beasts from escaping?\nExcluding all the other various measures and constructions, these items alone would cost more than the land title deeds.\nRoughly speaking, just laying a basic foundation would require at least fifty million, and even that might not be enough.\nAnd that wasn’t even considering the even more terrifying Pet Beast procurement costs later on!\nSu Ping wanted to leverage the advantages of the Forest Wolf. He planned to purchase some Plant-based Pet Beast offspring for the new Heart of Woods business venture and also wanted to research the breeding and evolution of Plant-based Pet Beasts.\nWell, buying just one wouldn’t be enough, right? After all, I still need to consider the enhancement of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas!\nBut after purchasing Plant-based Pet Beasts, what about the other expenses?\nEven if Plant-based Pet Beasts didn’t require feeding and food consumption like others, they still needed things like Spirit Water.\nWhich of these doesn’t cost money?\nThis was still just for Plant-based Pet Beasts. If the planned large lake was completed, and if he continued to research and develop aquatic Pet Beast resources, then that was another story—it would undoubtedly carry a staggering price tag.\nThe expenditure involved couldn’t be covered by just one or two hundred million.\nAnd right now, the monthly cost for food, tree fruits, and other necessities for his fifty Forest Wolves already amounted to several hundred thousand.\nSo, raising a group of Pet Beasts was truly not something an ordinary Beast Tamer could afford.\nHowever, Su Ping wasn’t in too much of a hurry. He knew he had to take things one step at a time, just like eating a meal one bite at a time.\nSpeaking of which, once they evolved into Wanmu Wolves, they could extract nutrients from sunlight, greatly reducing their food requirements. At most, they might munch on some tree fruits when they had nothing else to do.\nIt truly is the best evolutionary form!\nHow wonderful it would be if all Pet Beasts could be like the Wanmu Wolf?\nSu Ping shook his head, then his spirits suddenly lifted.\nHis father had passed away, and it was time for his own life to return to normal: improve his strength, and research and develop Pet Beast cultivation!\nMy current goal is to make money! Setting other things aside for now, I need to secure the land titles for the surrounding areas first!\nSu Ping was reinvigorated and ready to make a big splash.\n「On the other hand.」\nAt the Legion base near West Dragon Lake and Linzhou City, an imposing man in his fifties, with general’s stars on his shoulders, sat behind his desk in an office at the heart of the base.\nSeveral documents rested on his desk and in his hands.\nThe content of the documents was straightforward, listing the cultivation directions reported by each division and the roster of elites selected for cultivation. It also detailed the resources that had been distributed and their specific allocations.\nEvery detail was meticulously noted.\nGeneral Zhao read through them very carefully.\nThis was his first major initiative since taking command of the Eastern Forest Army, and he certainly understood what it represented.\nIn recent years, the Dragon Nation found itself at a special juncture. Its ruler, though young, was a brilliant sovereign rarely seen throughout history. Once in power, he had made a stunning impact, not by remaining idle but by acting decisively!\nHe had firmly suppressed many old-establishment Beast Taming Gate families and strongly supported the emerging new scholarly Beast Tamer faction. At the same time, he vigorously rectified issues concerning resource allocation within the Beast Master Associations and Breeder Associations across the country.\nFollowing this, it was time for the Beast Tamer Legions!\nSetting aside the infighting among the Legion’s higher-ups, he had now been entrusted with a heavy responsibility: dispatched to take command of the new forces and ensure a smooth start to the internal military reforms.\nThose Breeders in the Legion, despite being given a plethora of resources, how many years had it been since they had produced any significant results? It had reached a point where the Beast Tamer warriors within the Legion often found their combat power inferior to that of Beast Tamers from outside.\nThis situation had clearly dissatisfied the young ruler.\nThus, this grand internal competition for elite cultivation, orchestrated by General Zhao himself, began with great pomp and circumstance.\nThe actions of the various divisions also pleased General Zhao. It had only been a few days since the Legion-wide announcement, and these units had already identified their cultivation directions and Breeders.\nHmm? Not bad. The Shadow Leopard’s evolutionary body, the ’Chasing Shadow Leopard,’ reaching Commander Level is one thing, but for the Breeder to have a chance to cultivate the ’Shadow Step’ Skill? Interesting.\nThe Great Strength Vajra Ape? This is a Pet Beast with extraordinary strength at Peak Command, and there are even some evolutionary bodies with Monarch Level racial potential. Good, good.\nAs General Zhao read through the document, he nodded, making a mental note of the unit names that caught his eye, planning to pay special attention to their performance during the competition.\nBut soon, General Zhao’s eyebrows shot up, a look of surprise flickering in his eyes.\nThose rascals from the Tiger C Troop must have seen what was happening with the Rock Tiger Troop, right? Just waiting for this order to be announced, tsk, tsk. The Roaring Snow Tiger’s peak Commander Level evolutionary body, the Ice Scale White Tiger, and the Winged Sky Tiger with its flying capabilities? Huh? And a Netherworld Demon Tiger with Monarch racial potential?\nJust as expected! With even a slight leak of resources from within the Legion, what can’t those external Breeders cultivate? Why bother maintaining those worthless cultivation departments in the Legion that haven’t produced results in years?\nHowever, judging solely from this Legion-wide competition, it seemed the Fierce Tiger C Troop would most likely have the last laugh.\nTiger-type Pet Beasts were indeed somewhat more powerful than other terrestrial Pet Beasts, and more evolutionary forms had been developed for them.\nHe continued scrolling. General Zhao, who could typically deduce a general idea just from the proposed cultivation directions, suddenly paused. He stared at the line below, blinking slowly, somewhat confused for a moment. Clearly, he didn’t immediately comprehend it.\nThe reason was simple, as the line below clearly read:\n[Forest Wolf Troop, Wolf A Troop. Commander: Zhang Lie. Cultivators: Sun Xiao, Gao Hang, Li Da...]\nThe preceding details were not particularly special. The Forest Wolf Troop had a slightly larger number of personnel undergoing cultivation, but that was normal. He was aware of the recent exercise where the Rock Tiger Troop had inflicted a three-to-one casualty ratio on the Forest Wolf Troop.\nGeneral Zhao could guess that the young Lin Lei probably wanted the Forest Wolf Troop to redeem themselves, so he had selected a few more individuals for cultivation to choose the most suitable ones from among them.\nBut what he couldn’t comprehend was the line that followed:\n[Cultivation Direction: Evolution, Skill Cultivation. Evolutionary Body: Wanmu Wolf. Cultivation Skill: Heart of Woods.]\nWanmu Wolf? Never heard of that before.\nGeneral Zhao pondered for a moment and even searched on the computer, but he still found no information. Not only was there nothing on the commercial market, but he couldn’t find any information on this Wanmu Wolf even within the Legion’s internal database.\nWhat kind of evolutionary form is this?\nGeneral Zhao thought for a bit more, then pulled out the thick stack of documents. He quickly found the report pertaining to the Forest Wolf Troop, along with the details of the required resources and their delivery location.\nHeart of Woods Cultivation Base? In Linzhou City? A completely new and undiscovered Forest Wolf evolutionary form? A young Breeder fresh out of graduation? An Intermediate Breeder registered with the Jianghai Province Breeders Association? One of Liu Fuhai’s people?\nGeneral Zhao’s pupils constricted, his interest genuinely piqued.ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nThe Forest Wolf was one of the most common and widely used Pet Beasts. If a new, popular evolutionary form for it emerged, it would be a major event!\nAnd such significant news hasn’t leaked out at all? It’s either still in a confidential phase, or our own soldiers were being deceived.\nHowever, the latter seemed unlikely.\nLinzhou City?\nAt this thought, General Zhao stopped reading and took out his phone. He quickly found a familiar number. It belonged to none other than Liu Fuhai, the current vice-chairman of the Linzhou City Breeder Association.\nAlthough the local Breeder and Beast Master Associations had no subordinate relationship with the Legion, the two men were on relatively good personal terms.\nIn the past, Linzhou City hadn’t produced any impressive results in the Breeder competitions.\nNow, it seems Old Liu is planning to make a big splash with this Wanmu Wolf evolutionary form, keeping it under wraps until now, eh?\nHowever, after considering it, General Zhao decided not to call during working hours. Instead, he merely sent a text message:\n\"Old Liu, congratulations! You’ve hidden this one quite deep! Haha!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 114: Chapter 105: The Riddle Man Deserves to Die! Xiao Qing’s Breakthrough\n\"This time, take the opportunity to discuss and learn from each other; it will greatly benefit your futures!\"\nIn the office of Vice President Liu of the Breeder Association, he said to the several Breeders before his desk.\n\"Yes!\"\nStanding before Vice President Liu was a group of young Breeders. Most were under thirty years old and were newly promoted Junior Breeders sent from Jianghai Province to neighboring Huaiyang Province for an exchange program.\nAfter sending them off, two people remained in the office.\nThese two were none other than the Intermediate Breeders from the Jianghai Province Breeders Association who specialized in Forest Wolves.\nOne was Sun Chaoju, whom Su Ping knew very well. The other was another Breeder from Linzhou City specializing in Forest Wolves.\nVice President Liu glanced at them, took a sip of tea to moisten his throat, smiled, and said, \"Alright, what’s there to be so gloomy about? The job in the Legion isn’t that easy, is it? Now you’ve finally realized there’s always someone better out there, right?\"\nSun Chaoju and the other Breeder specializing in Forest Wolves exchanged helpless looks.\nIt was Sun Chaoju, being relatively closer to him, who reluctantly looked at Vice President Liu and said, \"Teacher, if it had been a fair competition, that would be one thing. But I had just begun negotiations with the deputy commander of that unit, and the very next day, I was replaced without any explanation. Old Wang, too. He had just settled on a preliminary agreement with the instructor of the Forest Wolf Troop, only to be informed that the contract was voided. Do you know what’s really going on?\"\nVice President Liu continued sipping his tea, looking at them helplessly. \"The Legion is making a major move. This time, it’s just an appetizer, aimed at internal changes. However, your abilities are indeed hardly sufficient to get involved in these muddy waters.\"\nSun Chaoju and Old Wang exchanged glances.\nTheir teacher really knew something?\nʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nVice President Liu was a good man in all aspects, except for one: he loved to be coy.\nThe more anxious the two before him became, the more unhurriedly he savored his tea before continuing, \"The higher-ups are dissatisfied with the Cultivation Department of the Beast Tamer Legion for taking resources without delivering results. So, the Legion is preparing to implement elite outsourced cultivation.\nIn Linzhou, besides you two who are skilled at Forest Wolf cultivation, there’s only that kid, Su Ping. However, he’s completely focused on the evolution of the Wanmu Wolf. He probably doesn’t know about this and wouldn’t be in the mood to bother with it anyway.\nBut you must understand, this is a revolution for the entire Forest Army!\"\nVice President Liu’s expression turned serious. \"The race limit of Forest Wolves is the Elite Peak Level. Even if some advanced resources are consumed to break through that race limit, the improvement isn’t significant!\nHowever, the upper limit for this upcoming Legion-wide grand competition is the Commander Level! So, you should understand what this implies!\"\nThe two were slightly startled, then understanding dawned, and they exchanged wry, helpless smiles.\nThey now understood what it meant.\nThe cultivation cap for the Legion competition was the Commander Level. However, normally, the Racial Potential of Forest Wolves only reached the Elite Level at best. This meant there was only one way forward!\nThat was to cultivate for evolution.\nBut how could cultivating evolution be so easy and simple?\nThey were aware of widely publicized evolutionary paths like the Forest Wolf and the Elf Wolf, but the success rates weren’t particularly high.\nMore importantly, could these two most common and widespread Forest Wolf Evolvers meet the requirements of the Forest Wolf Troop within the Legion?\nClearly, the answer was no.\nSo, why had the Forest Wolf Troop changed their minds after initial contact with them? The reason was simple: they had found a stronger Forest Wolf Breeder.\nOne capable of enabling Forest Wolves to complete their evolution and potentially secure a prominent place in the Legion’s upcoming internal grand competition.\nWhat point was there in even talking about a serious competition with that unknown and mysterious Forest Wolf Breeder? Couldn’t the commander of the Forest Wolf Troop distinguish who was more capable? Obviously, no one was a fool. That was impossible.\nSo, after this blunt assessment from their teacher, Sun Chaoju and Master Wang, who was beside him, grew even more curious. They both looked at Liu Fuhai.\n\"Teacher, do you know who that Senior Forest Wolf Breeder is? Is he from our Jianghai Province?\"\nWhat kind of Forest Wolf Breeder could it be, and what kind of cultivation techniques would they use to meet the demands of the Forest Wolf Troop? They had even made a decision without any intention of continuing negotiations with us. As Breeders who also specialized in Forest Wolves, we naturally want to learn a thing or two. Even if we can’t learn much, it would be good just to broaden our horizons!\nUnfortunately, Vice President Liu shook his head. \"The Legion and local authorities cannot interfere with each other’s affairs unless there are special circumstances. Those are the rules.\"\nSeeing the disappointment in his two students’ eyes, Old Liu smiled again and said, \"However, when the time comes for the grand Legion competition, I should be among the spectators. I expect their respective Breeders will also be invited. Then, we can all see just who this remarkable person is.\"\nIt seemed that was all they could do for now.\nSun Chaoju and Master Wang exchanged looks. The former remarked with some feeling, \"Speaking of which, if Su Ping were here, with his Heart of Woods, he’d surely be able to participate in the cooperative cultivation, wouldn’t he?\"\nThe ’Heart of Woods’ skill is incredibly versatile with top-notch effects. It’s evidently indispensable in the cultivation of any Forest Wolf Evolver!",

      "content": "Chapter 115: Chapter 105: All Riddlers Must Die! Xiao Qing’s Breakthrough_2\nHowever, Vice President Liu simply shook his head.\nIt wasn’t just him; even when he visited Qin Erlong these past few days, that old fellow had prattled on at length.\nEvery word was a complaint about Su Ping:\nHe didn’t understand a girl’s heart.\nHe didn’t know to take the initiative as a young man.\nIt had been so long since he’d called Xiao Xue.\nIt was a stream of nonsensical blabber, just short of Qin Erlong taking Su Ping by the hand and teaching him how to woo girls.\nClearly, Qin Erlong must have pursued his own wife in the same way back then.\nOf course, Qin Erlong did mention some serious matters too.\nFor instance, Qin Xiaoxue had told him about a Secret Realm about to manifest at Su Ping’s family home, asking him to keep an eye on things if Su Ping requested assistance.\nBeyond that, Qin Erlong mostly complained about himself.Google seaʀᴄh ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nWhy on earth did I have to bring up the Wanmu Wolf’s evolution path? It only delayed the chance for their relationship to advance further!\nVice President Liu deeply disdained Qin Erlong’s attitude—both his frustration that Su Ping wasn’t living up to his romantic expectations and this purely inane chatter from someone with too much time on his hands.\nA Breeder like Su Ping, a good kid who sets everything else aside and focuses solely on Pet Beast Cultivation, that’s how he achieved such profound expertise and research capabilities at such a young age!\nVice President Liu glanced at the two before him.\nIf these two had even half—no, a third—of Su Ping’s research spirit and dedication, they wouldn’t have been dismissed from the Forest Wolf Troop without even making an impression. Damn it, they made me lose face, and now they have the gall to come crying to me? Do they have any shame?\nThe more he thought about it, the angrier Vice President Liu became. With a wave of his hand, he said, \"Get lost already! Instead of wasting time on this rubbish, you’d be better off figuring out how to improve your breeding skills.\"\nAfter shooing away the two unpromising students, Vice President Liu looked down and saw a message flashing on his phone.\nThe sender of the message made Vice President Liu pause in surprise.\nHe had just been discussing the Legion tournament, and now the very protagonist of that event was messaging him.\nWhat in the world is this message about?\nVice President Liu frowned slightly as he read the message on his phone, \"Old Liu, congratulations! You sure kept that one quiet! HAHA!\"\nCongratulations for what? Kept what quiet?\nAfter a moment’s thought, Vice President Liu replied, \"What’s up?\"\nDING-DONG. The reply came quickly.\nBut it only left Old Liu more confused.\n\"HAHAHA, I get it! Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone. It’s not often you get a chance to show off, Old Liu. I definitely won’t spoil your fun!\"\nReading Zhao Deguang’s message, Vice President Liu grew even more perplexed.\nGet what? Damn it, I don’t even understand what you’re rambling about! Riddlers really deserve to die.\nBut Old Liu couldn’t be bothered with him. As the Vice President of the Breeder Association—effectively the acting President—he had plenty of official duties each day and wasn’t just sitting in an office idly chatting.\nWho has the time to waste gossiping with these old codgers?\n「...」\nAt this point, Old Liu was obviously unaware that Su Ping had already completed the Wanmu Wolf Cultivation and had even begun deploying them.\nOf course, one couldn’t blame Su Ping for not informing the Vice President of the Breeder Association, who was still waiting to offer assistance.\nHe was simply too busy.\nJust as he often said, once he entered a busy phase, Su Ping truly would neglect sleep and forget to eat.\nEspecially with the Heart of Woods project, stimulated by the prospect of making quick money, Su Ping had directly lifted the weekly restriction of accepting only one Heart of Woods Forest Wolf Cultivation slot.\nNaturally, the official explanation was that his Cultivation techniques had further matured, allowing for a significant increase in success rates and, consequently, a faster Cultivation speed.\nThus, Su Ping’s days were incredibly full!\nMeditation, bonding with the ten Forest Wolves from the Legion, concocting and administering the Heart of Woods Magic Potion for their Cultivation, and combat training!\nIndeed, with his mental vision, Su Ping could finally train the Forest Wolves in combat, not just passively have them use Skills.\nSu Ping had also gleaned these training methods from Zhang Lie.\nOld Sha served as supervisor while Su Ping’s own fifty Forest Wolves were divided into two squads.\nEach wolf wore red or blue markers representing their respective teams.\nThen, they engaged in stealth and annihilation combat exercises in the forest.\nOf course, this \"annihilation\" wasn’t literally deadly. It would be too great a loss if they died during training without even facing a real enemy. A hit to a button placed on a vital spot, which then emitted a sound, counted as a ’death’.\nIf one had to describe it, it was somewhat similar to tactical exercises within a Legion.\nThanks to his mental vision, Su Ping could observe the combat maneuvers, spontaneous reactions, and fighting styles of the Forest Wolves he was connected to.\nThis provided him with opportunities for further adjustments and precise, targeted micro-training.\nThe only slight drawback is that they are all Forest Wolves, and battling in the woods becomes too monotonous. After a few rounds, the effectiveness diminishes. If I could develop different Species Pet Beasts and conduct mock battles between various species, that would be very promising!\nAnd undoubtedly, the one thing most needed to achieve all this was money!\nTherefore, in this recent period, in addition to awakening the Heart of Woods in all of his own remaining twenty-odd Forest Wolves, Su Ping had also successfully cultivated ten *additional* Forest Wolves with the Heart of Woods for clients!\nAfter deducting expenses and taxes, he was left with a whopping sum of just over thirty million!\nThen, more than half of this stupendous sum was promptly spent.\nUnder a contract, a large tract of undeveloped land south of the Lingxi River, along with the barren mountain behind it, would be developed and utilized by Su Ping and the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base for the next one hundred years.\nSu Ping didn’t let the remaining funds sit idle either.\nAlthough the money was still far from enough to complete the renovations according to his grand blueprint, he could certainly begin the planning phase.\nAfter all, as the reputation of the Heart of Woods spread and its Cultivation success rate remained high, business was booming—not quite a case of raking in gold daily, but certainly thriving.\nHowever, it was evident that Su Ping had overlooked one thing.\nAfter finishing the day’s training, carrying Xiao Qing, Su Ping returned from the forest and grassland at the back to the reception and residential/experimental area up front.\nThere, he saw Lao Guan, who looked resentful and noticeably thinner after the past few days.\n\"Uncle Guan, have the designers left?\" Su Ping asked.\nToday was the day the specialists in courtyard design and renovation were scheduled to come, since neither Lao Guan nor Su Ping were professionals in that area.\nTo ensure the space was both practical and aesthetically pleasing, they naturally had to bring in some experts.\nLao Guan nodded without a word, just staring at Su Ping with that same resentful expression.\nSu Ping felt somewhat awkward; he understood why.\nThese past few days, Lao Guan has been much busier than me. It’s no exaggeration to say he’s been rising earlier than a rooster and going to bed later than a dog.\nSu Ping quickly said, \"Uncle Guan, when is your daughter coming to have her Pet Beast cultivated? We have so many Forest Wolves now, I can easily help her cultivate one.\"\nAs expected, at this mention, Lao Guan sighed and said reluctantly, \"Xiao Ping, setting other things aside, business is getting better and better. We really need to hire some reception staff, don’t you think? I honestly can’t handle it all by myself!\"\nSu Ping nodded helplessly, then his eyes suddenly lit up. \"Right, what are your daughter’s plans for the future? How about this: let her come and help me out. She’ll get a regular salary, and frankly, I wouldn’t trust just anyone else with the job.\"\nSpeaking of which, I did call Li Shu to ask, but that fellow just kept saying he was busy with important matters. I have no idea what he’s actually up to. I couldn’t be bothered to press him. Now that I think about it, we really do need more people for reception.\n\"This...\" Guan Qianshan hesitated.\nHowever, Su Ping, still carrying Xiao Qing, quickly said, \"Alright, alright, Uncle Guan, I have important matters to attend to. I’ll leave this with you. If your daughter isn’t sure what to do in the future, just have her join us here!\"\nWatching Su Ping dart into the medical room, Guan Qianshan shook his head helplessly.\nBut Su Ping hadn’t been fibbing to Lao Guan.\nHe genuinely had important things to do.\nAfter several days of meditation, Xiao Qing felt stable and was now eager to try.\nThe little fellow wanted to attempt a breakthrough to the Elite Level by consuming a Devil’s Willow Leaf!",

      "content": "Chapter 116: Chapter 106: The Onslaught of Xiao Qing! Poison Flower!\nIn some ways, Su Ping was not a qualified Beast Tamer.\nRelatively speaking, the amount of energy he invested in his own Soul Contracted Beast was not significant. In fact, on many occasions, the attention he paid to it was less than what he gave to the little Paperman and Old Sha.\nHowever, regardless of the circumstances, a Soul Contracted Beast was the most essential proof of a Beast Tamer’s true strength.\nFortunately, although Xiao Qing would occasionally get jealous and demand Su Ping set aside time each day to spend exclusively with the little one, at other times it was very well-behaved and motivated.\nPerhaps in Xiao Qing’s heart, it was precisely because it wasn’t working hard enough and its strength wasn’t strong enough that its master didn’t pay much attention to it.\nTherefore, among all the Forest Wolves of the Heart of Woods, Xiao Qing could be considered one of the most diligent.\nFacts had proven that with great talent, sufficient effort, and a master providing ’cheats’ on the side, a Pet Beast could do as it pleased. Like now, Su Ping placed Xiao Qing on the Life Detector, took the necessary treatment tools, and Old Sha was ready outside, prepared to use emergency treatment measures at any time.\nWith the Eye of Truth, Su Ping looked at Xiao Qing before him.\nIn less than two months, the little one in front of him had transformed from a newly weaned puppy into what it was now:\n[Mutated Forest Wolf (Contracted)]\n[Attribute: Wood, Poison]\n[Current Level: Common Tenth Level]\n[Racial Potential: Commander Third Rank]\n[Skills: Sunlight Absorption (Proficient), Poison Vine Strangulation (Proficient), Self-Healing (Proficiency), Accelerated Growth (Proficiency), Mutated Poison Wood Heart (Proficiency)]\nA mutated wolf pup that hadn’t even advanced to Elite Level had reached Master Level in Vine Strangling and Sunlight Absorption in just a month. The rest of its skills, including the Mutated Poison Wood Heart, were also at Proficiency.\nSuch a speed of skill improvement could not simply be described as talented.\nIt was also because of the improvement of its own skills, as well as the presence of the Heart of the Poison Wood, that Su Ping dared to agree to Xiao Qing’s suggestion for a trial after it was proposed.\nHe obviously understood Xiao Qing’s desire to become stronger.\nOnce everything was ready, with a determined look in Xiao Qing’s eyes, Su Ping took something out.\nIt was a very small willow leaf, only the length and thickness of a finger. This willow leaf was pitch black with purple-red vascular patterns on it. At first glance, it looked less like any plant’s leaf and more akin to the fabled horns of a demon from the abyss.\nHowever, upon seeing this, Xiao Qing became suddenly excited.\nObjects of the same attribute held a great appeal for Pet Beasts. Therefore, high-level resources that emerged in the wild would often have Pet Beasts guarding them. The Devil’s Willow Leaf appealed to Xiao Qing due to its Poison Attribute and, making it an even better fit, its compatibility with the Heart of the Poison Wood.\nBut this time, Su Ping was not careless. He put on gloves and a mask, split the Devil’s Willow Leaf in two, and then brought one part to Xiao Qing’s mouth.\nThe leaf was too small. It was swallowed by Xiao Qing without a sound. However, just three minutes later, a reaction occurred!\nSu Ping instinctively stepped back.Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nFrom Xiao Qing’s body, streams of faint, dark green breath spilled out from its nose and mouth.\nTo Su Ping’s surprise, as this faint mist touched the remaining half of the Devil’s Willow Leaf, it instantly absorbed the rest of the leaf, much like the Heart of Woods would absorb the power of plants.\nClearly, for Xiao Qing, just half of the Devil’s Willow Leaf was not enough! Not nearly enough!\nSu Ping held his breath, his gaze unwavering as he watched both the Life Detector and Xiao Qing’s body.\nXiao Qing had fallen into a deep sleep, but on its body, apart from the enveloping mist, there was also a faint glow.\nNo wonder Poison Type Pet Beasts were said to be the most dangerous, perhaps second to none.\nSu Ping now witnessed it firsthand.\nJust the act of consuming a resource to attempt a breakthrough was enough for the surrounding mist to teach a lesson to any who thought to take advantage at that moment.\nSimultaneously, Su Ping could see on the Life Detector that Xiao Qing’s heartbeat and pulse had suddenly accelerated. Not only that, but all other metrics also showed a significant increase.\nThe next moment, a low Wolf Howl resounded.\nThe engulfing mist completely disappeared. At the same time, Su Ping could feel very clearly in his spirit an indescribable sensation of refreshment. It fed back directly to Su Ping from the deepest part of his spirit!\nBreakthrough!\nElite Level!\nBeast Tamers and Pet Beasts were linked in terms of levels. A Beast Tamer’s level breakthrough would provide feedback to their Pet Beast, and similarly, a Pet Beast’s breakthrough would also provide feedback to the Beast Tamer. This was particularly evident in the early stages.\nAnd naturally, there was a realm-based bond between the two. Generally speaking, as long as they were in the same realm, there wouldn’t be any problem. It was also barely acceptable for a Pet Beast to be slightly higher in realm than the Beast Tamer, as was the case now.\nAlthough, if I were to put Xiao Qing into the Beast Taming Space again, my own Beast Taming Space would feel a sense of swelling. This is even though the Soul Contract is in place, meaning the Pet Beast Home’s talent restrictions naturally don’t apply to Xiao Qing.",

      "content": "Chapter 117: Chapter 106: The Onslaught of Xiao Qing! Poison Flower!_2\nThese were some of the side effects when a Pet Beast’s level surpassed that of its Beast Tamer by a whole tier.\nFortunately, Su Ping could also feel that, with the feedback from Xiao Qing’s Soul Contract, his spiritual power had also reached a peak.\nWhenever he wished, he could break through that vague barrier and become a true Elite Beast Tamer. This also officially meant becoming qualified to take the Beast Tamer professional certification exam.\nObviously, there was no hurry at the moment.\nSu Ping’s spirit rippled, but his gaze remained firmly fixed on Xiao Qing.\nThe glimmer of the breakthrough disappeared, and the faint poisonous fog retracted into its body.\nFrom start to finish, Xiao Qing, having digested the Devil’s Willow Leaf in less than half an hour, lightly leaped down from the Life Detector.\nThere was still no significant change. Its body was just slightly taller.\nBut soon, Su Ping sensed something was off.\nAfter all, Xiao Qing was his Contracted Beast.\nHe could feel even the slightest change most directly, not to mention that Xiao Qing’s current changes were definitely not minor.\nImmediately, the Eye of Truth, which had just been activated, was once again locked onto Xiao Qing before him!\nAnd the changes, vastly different from half an hour ago, also registered in Su Ping’s mind.\n[Mutated Forest Wolf (Contracted)]\n[Attribute: Wood, Poison]\n[Current Level: Elite First Rank]\n[Racial Potential: Commander Third Rank]\n[Skills: Simplified, Poison Flower (Beginner)]\nAs for the Level breakthrough, Su Ping did not care.\nHe did not care that the skill level hadn’t improved. At this moment, all of Su Ping’s attention was firmly locked onto the last skill that had appeared among Xiao Qing’s Skills!\nHad Xiao Qing awakened a new Skill with this Level breakthrough?\nEven for Mutated Pet Beasts, it was very difficult to comprehend an entirely new Skill beyond those of their original race.\nBut Xiao Qing had done it.\nAnd obviously, it was an ability derived from its Poison Type mutation!\nSu Ping eagerly checked Xiao Qing’s Skill changes:\n[Poison Flower (Beginner): A Special Skill formed by combining Poison Type and Wood Element attributes. It can be used independently to create a fragrant aroma with Poison Type effects. It can also be attached to other Wood Element objects, imbuing the corresponding Wood Element abilities with poisonous effects.]\nA very simple Skill.\nIt couldn’t even be considered powerful.\nHowever, it gave Su Ping a strangely familiar feeling.\nPoison Flower of the wolf... was his Xiao Qing aiming to further strengthen the ’Tree Realm Descent’ of the Wanmu Wolf?\nNevertheless, Su Ping knew this was just a sense of déjà vu from reading the Skill description.\nThe Skill itself was meant to enhance Xiao Qing’s own combat capabilities.\nHe affectionately ruffled the excited Xiao Qing’s head.\n\"Remarkable!\"\nIndeed, remarkable. In fact, this wasn’t just a matter of one Skill.\nThis aligned with what Vice President Liu had taught in his course: Skills are concrete displays and derivatives of a Pet Beast’s capabilities.\nAnd Evolution is the transformation that occurs when a Pet Beast’s proficient abilities reach a peak.\nTherefore, many Pet Beasts’ Evolutions could be researched by focusing on their Skills.\nFor example, the Wanmu Wolf, in essence, was the transformation of the Forest Wolf’s most basic racial skill, Sunlight Absorption, reaching its peak.\nXiao Qing’s comprehension of a new Skill undoubtedly represented a research direction for its Evolution.\nOf course, this was truly just a direction, not even a concrete plan yet.\nSu Ping shook his head, intending to lead Xiao Qing out, but at that moment, as expected, the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas also provided direct feedback:\n[Cultivation of Poison Type mutated bloodline Pet Beasts has improved.]\n[Poison Type mutated bloodline Pet Beast promoted to Elite Level, comprehended the Poison Type Skill: Poison Flower. Gained Forest Wolf Experience Points: 300!]\n[Further analysis of the reasons for the Poison Type mutation in Forest Wolves has been carried out. Can expend 42,700 Experience Points from this Catalog to forcibly analyze the cause of the Forest Wolf’s Poison Type bloodline mutation and obtain methods for breeding this mutation.]\nAs expected!\nNot only had he gained Experience Points for the Forest Wolf Catalog, but the Experience Points needed for the Poison Type mutation analysis had also decreased considerably.\nAlthough for him, it was still an undoubtedly huge expense, hadn’t he also seen some glimmers of dawn?\nThinking of this, Su Ping glanced at the Forest Wolf Catalog, which had changed its appearance:\n[Catalog: Forest Wolf]\n[Current Catalog Level: 3 (619/20,000)]\nThe increase in Experience seemed trivial in the face of the terrifying amount required for leveling up.\nPreviously, Su Ping hadn’t really considered that after reaching LV3, the amount of Experience needed for further improvement would be so immense.\nThat was one of the reasons Su Ping planned to focus on illuminating the Catalogs of other Pet Beasts.\nA requirement of 20,000 Experience Points, not to mention the Experience he would consume in the process, suggested that leveling up to LV4 wasn’t going to be easy.\nAfter a brief look, Su Ping paid it no more mind. Leading the excited Xiao Qing, he said directly,\n\"Let’s go test the effects of the new Skill!\"\n\"AWOOO!\"\n\"Old Sha, you come with us too!\"\n\"AWOOO!\"\n「In the middle of the night.」\nLao Guan yawned, went to the bathroom, and then, out of habit as the gatekeeper, took a stroll around the perimeter.\nAlthough Su Ping had never requested this, Lao Guan, despite his grumbling, actually did much more than required. For instance, after patrolling the area and finding nothing unusual, Lao Guan went to the monitoring room for a final check.\nHowever, Guan Qianshan, who was originally drowsy, was taken aback.\nUnder the dark night sky, the wooded area before the Heart of Woods was brightly illuminated by searchlights.\nThe area that should have been quiet was still bustling with activity.\nIn the video footage from the surveillance cameras, two wolves and one man appeared to have no trace of sleepiness.Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nIn that clearing, they continuously unleashed Skills.\nAnd Su Ping, beside them, was constantly directing them while swiftly jotting down notes in a brand-new notebook.\nThis was not the first time Lao Guan had seen such a scene.\nEspecially a few days ago, when the Old Wolf had not yet completed its Evolution, Lao Guan would almost certainly see Su Ping there every time he got up at night.\nOver these past few days, Guan Qianshan had welcomed numerous Beast Tamers who came for Cultivation.\nNearly everyone was generous with their praise for Su Ping:\n\"’A true Genius Breeder!’\"\n\"’He has great potential!’\"\n\"’A bright future ahead!’\"\nThis was all because their Forest Wolves had acquired the Heart of Woods Skill.\nAt such a young age, with such remarkable breeding proficiency and results, it seemed this young fellow truly deserved such praise.\nThis was particularly true after they learned the significance of the Wanmu Wolf.\nYet, Guan Qianshan was the only one who could see the hard work Su Ping put in behind his Talent.\nTalent plus effort determines the upper limit for a Beast Tamer!\nAnd in this world, that limit is always set by those who possess both Talent and the dedication to work for it.\nBut here before him was such a person.\nSo, just where was Su Ping’s limit?\nThinking this, Lao Guan let out a sigh, and even his drowsiness somewhat retreated.\nDamn it, what’s with this sudden urge to work overtime!?\nHowever, Lao Guan’s urge to work overtime remained unfulfilled.\nThis was because, before long, Su Ping noticed Lao Guan was still awake and asked him to cook some late-night snacks. After eating, Su Ping returned to his room under Guan Qianshan’s relieved gaze.\nIt was good that Su Ping was resting. That way, he could go back to sleep at 2 a.m. without feeling guilty.\nHowever, just as Lao Guan thought Su Ping was finally resting, Su Ping, having finished washing up, lay on his bed and took a deep breath.\nAn Elite Level breakthrough was nothing major for Xiao Qing.\nBut for a Beast Tamer, an Elite Level breakthrough was crucial!\nIt was only after reaching the Elite Level that a Beast Tamer’s Beast Taming Space could be effectively utilized.\nAnd now, he was about to begin his ascension to the Elite Level!",

      "content": "Chapter 118: Chapter 107: Promotion to Elite! Su Ping’s Space Characteristics!\nThe Beast Taming Space is one of the primary manifestations of a Beast Tamer’s abilities. For a powerful Beast Tamer, the Beast Taming Space is not merely a portable space for their Pet Beasts; it is also an accumulation of wealth and resources, or even a training ground and medical facility for them. This is due to the Space Characteristics that emerge within the Beast Taming Space after each Realm breakthrough.\nHowever, Su Ping was clearly different from other ordinary Beast Tamers. The Stone of Creation, after merging with his Beast Taming Space, was constantly transforming it. It was merely awaiting Su Ping’s advancement in Realm, his leap to becoming an Elite Level Beast Tamer, to fully awaken the ’Ecological Cycle’ Space Trait. And now, that moment had undoubtedly arrived.\nThe ripples in the space were inconspicuous within the dark Beast Taming Space. However, Su Ping felt an explosive sensation, as if everything around him was boiling with an excitement so intense it was difficult to contain. The cramped, dark Beast Taming Space seemed to shatter at this moment, as energy infused from his spiritual power ignited its shadowy depths.\nAn indescribable coolness flowed from his mind, spreading through his limbs and bones. His body, somewhat fatigued from helping Xiao Qing record its newest skill, Poison Flower, felt as if it had been completely rejuvenated.\nEvidently, while a Beast Tamer’s primary abilities lay in controlling beasts with spiritual power and the aspects of their Beast Taming Space, each advancement also brought a certain enhancement to their physical body, albeit not a significant one.\nSavoring the pleasant comfort, Su Ping refocused his attention on his Beast Taming Space. As his spiritual power surged and erupted, the once-dark Beast Taming Space began to slowly transform. A profound and mysterious power began to emanate, slowly carving out the space from its surroundings. The dark, murky air currents vanished, replaced by a void that was incorporated into the space.\nThe Stone of Creation, after vanishing for who knew how long, surprisingly re-emerged within Su Ping’s Beast Taming Space. A hazy fluctuation emanated from the Stone of Creation. This fluctuation not only accelerated the Beast Taming Space’s expansion but also transformed it from the size of a small storage room to that of a three-bedroom apartment. And it was still expanding.\nFinally, with a sharp cracking sound, as if something had shattered, the Beast Taming Space ceased its expansion. Its area, roughly two hundred square meters with a ceiling dozens of meters high, was enough to fill Su Ping with pleasant surprise.\nHowever, it was clear this wasn’t the end. That cracking sound hadn’t come from the space itself, but from the glowing Stone of Creation. The Stone of Creation completely shattered. But the changes it brought were not yet finished.\nActual earth materialized on the previously void ground. Moreover, this earthen ground was occasionally dotted with specks of vibrant green. Above, in the azure sky, clouds slowly began to appear. Then, to Su Ping’s utter astonishment, the tiny fragments of the shattered Stone of Creation slowly ascended into the sky and coalesced into a miniature sun!\nAt this moment, Su Ping’s Beast Taming Space, at first glance, seemed indistinguishable from the outside world.\nIs this the benefit brought by the Stone of Creation?\nSu Ping blinked, a wave of astonishment washing over him with a slight delay.\nBut no, that’s not right!\nWhat else is there?\nWith the Stone of Creation, I should have gained the Ecological Cycle Space Trait. But what about the Space Trait I was supposed to awaken after my Level breakthrough?\nSu Ping blinked again, and then realization struck him. In the next instant, the details of his Beast Taming Space’s newly awakened Trait appeared in his mind.\nThe first, undoubtedly, was the Trait bestowed by the Stone of Creation:\n[Ecological Cycle: Nature Type Resource Type Trait. Forms a stable ecological cycle system, completely identical to the energy cycle governed by the true natural laws of the outside world. Capable of cultivating plants and raising any creatures or Pet Beasts from the outside world. Spiritual power can be consumed to accelerate growth by creating artificial rainfall and increasing sunlight exposure.]\nThis Trait, needless to say, was crucial. It allowed many activities to be conducted directly within the Beast Taming Space. It was also the most encompassing Space Trait, useful in virtually any situation. Of course, it would be absurd if a Trait granted by Emperor Level Peak resources wasn’t useful. If it weren’t, Su Ping wouldn’t be constantly plagued by that nightmare of needing to marry into another family for support.\nWhat was truly important, undoubtedly, was the Space Trait he had awakened through his own breakthrough!\nHowever, when his Beast Taming Space instinctively relayed the details of the Trait he had obtained to its master, Su Ping was stunned. Because he sensed a special Space Trait he had never encountered before:\n[Space Absorption: Space Element Resource Type Trait. Can absorb the Origin of ownerless Secret Realms, adding corresponding changes and slight enhancements to one’s own Beast Taming Space from the absorbed Origin.]\n(Note 1: User must be physically present within the Secret Realm to activate.)\n(Note 2: Can only be successfully activated if there are no Pet Beasts within the Secret Realm whose Level exceeds the user’s own.)\n(Note 3: The magnitude of the absorption effect is determined by the Level difference between the Secret Realm’s original master and the user.)\nᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet",

Su Ping’s Space Characteristics!_2\nWhat did this mean?\nAlso, why had he awakened a Space Element Space Characteristic when his first Pet Beast was clearly a mutated Poison Type Forest Wolf?\nHowever, this was considered somewhat normal; such cases had occurred before, and not infrequently.\nAfter all, the acquisition of Beast Taming Space Traits, although somewhat related to one’s own Pet Beast, seemed to be mostly random.\nWhat truly made Su Ping curious was the Ability of this Space Characteristic—what exactly did it entail?\nAlthough, being his Space Characteristic Ability, he had an innate understanding of it, its specific effects would only be clear once he used it.\nAnd the method of use was to find an unclaimed Secret Realm.\nFor others, this Space Characteristic was likely as useless as could be.\nAfter all, it seemed Secret Realms weren’t so easily found.\nBut for Su Ping, it apparently wasn’t a problem.\nBecause in his own backyard, there was such a Secret Realm about to emerge.\nIt was like being handed a pillow just as he was getting sleepy,\nSu Ping thought.\nAfter much thought, Su Ping could only attribute this to possessing the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas.\nPerhaps the world’s Origin was secretly watching over him?\nShaking his head, Su Ping wasn’t in a hurry to try. It wouldn’t be too late to study this Ability after the little Paperman’s Secret Realm appeared.\nFor now, he still needed to familiarize himself with his own Beast Taming Space.\nAlthough the Space Absorption Trait he had awakened didn’t assist with cultivation within the space, he was fortunate to have Qin Xiaoxue’s help.\nThe ecological cycling Ability bestowed by the Stone of Creation was enough for Su Ping to truly experience the joy of cultivation.\nAnd first and foremost was the planting of Plant Type resources!\nIn an instant, Su Ping thought of something quite suitable:\nSmiley Sunflowers!\nEven though it was an Ordinary Level resource, sunflower seeds containing Light Power had become one of Old Sha’s favorite snacks after his Evolution was completed.\nUnfortunately, while buying a pound or two of these seeds wasn’t overly expensive, that amount was barely a couple of mouthfuls for Old Sha.\nAfter all, while normal people needed to peel sunflower seeds, Old Sha didn’t; he crunched them down, shells and all.\nConsidering he might have several Wanmu Wolves in the future, supplying them would be a considerable expense. If he could grow the sunflowers himself, it would undoubtedly alleviate some of that financial pressure.\nHe decided to act immediately!\nSu Ping promptly took out his phone, swiftly ordered several large bags of Smiley Sunflower seeds, and carefully read their planting instructions.\nIndeed, they turned out to be quite suitable.\nSmiley Sunflowers weren’t Plant-based Pet Beasts, but simply Plant Type resources. Moreover, they were extremely easy to grow, not demanding of the planting environment, needing only ample sunlight every day.\nHis Beast Taming Space perfectly met this condition.\nFor now, planting Low-level resources will do. Advanced Level resources aren’t so easy to grow.\nMoreover, significant results would primarily depend on an increase in the Beast Tamer’s Level.\nSu Ping hadn’t considered aiming too high. At this stage, trying to cultivate Advanced Level resources would be a pipe dream.\nHe let out a long breath. At this moment, not a hint of sleepiness remained; his Spirit was excited to the extreme.\nSimultaneously, the fatigue in his body had been dispelled by the recent level-up and breakthrough.\nHe had never felt so good.Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nNaturally, any sleepiness had vanished.\nHe focused inward for a moment. Sure enough, in his soul connection, besides the mind-linked Soul Contract with Xiao Qing, a new empty slot had appeared.\nElite Level Beast Tamer!\nFrom now on, he was an Elite Level Beast Tamer!\nAlthough this was merely the first threshold for professional Beast Tamers, and becoming a truly powerful Beast Tamer was still a distant goal, every journey begins with a single step. For Su Ping, this moment was profoundly significant.\nSo, Su Ping sat up straight.\nHe thought for a moment and then went to the side room.\nIn that room, under the deep night’s moonlight, only the little Paperman was present, practicing its sword draws repeatedly against a wall in the basement’s lightwell.\nThe little Paperman seemed to know neither loneliness nor monotony.\nPreviously, Su Anyong had also seen the little Paperman and had offered some opinions and suggestions regarding the Paperman Pet Beast.\nUndoubtedly, the Paperman Pet Beast’s potential was far too low.\nEven though Su Ping sensed it had a peculiar Racial Skill, and even if it might possess that Racial Skill—Paper Body Joint—it was still merely a Low-level Undead Pet Beast with Ordinary Level Racial Potential.\nIts known potential and strength were incredibly weak.\nHowever, Su Ping’s conviction had never wavered in the slightest!\nSu Anyong’s words couldn’t influence Su Ping’s choice; the little Paperman was unquestionably his second Pet Beast.\nIf, initially, Su Ping’s curiosity about the Secret Realm had driven him to want the little Paperman as his Pet Beast to better understand the mysteries of that hidden domain, then later, through continued interaction, Su Ping had become genuinely satisfied with the little Paperman itself.\nIts tenacious character truly suited Su Ping’s taste.\nAs for Racial Potential?\nSu Ping had never given it much deep thought.\nIs Racial Potential important?! Very important, extremely important!\nHe had already experienced the significance of a Pet Beast with high Racial Potential.\nIt could make someone as cautious and prudent as Zhou Shuchen suddenly become arrogant and conceited.\nIt had also made everyone deeply fearful of Miss Qin after witnessing the Monarch Level Racial Potential of the Life Ancient Tree.\nBut for Su Ping, it wasn’t that important.\nIf a Pet Beast could become a High-level, powerful Pet Beast just by eating, sleeping, and practicing casually every day, then what would be the need for Beast Tamers and Breeders? Perhaps some would say that Pet Beasts of strong Races would naturally become even stronger under the Cultivation of a powerful Beast Tamer. But Su Ping always believed that strength based on Level and Realm was only one aspect. That kind of strength could only bully the weaker; only those who attained strength step by step would have the courage to face stronger opponents—and become even stronger themselves!\nThe impact of the little Paperman’s sword strike against Old Sha, back then, still resonated deeply within Su Ping.\nBesides, only this kind of Cultivation could bring a greater sense of achievement!\nThus, he appeared behind the little Paperman and said, \"Little guy, how’s your practice going?\"\nHowever, just as Su Ping had expected, there was no improvement in the little Paperman’s Realm or skill levels.\nIt was still at the Ordinary Ninth Rank, with Jinge Technique at Perfection, Accelerated Casting at Beginner, and Paper Body Folding at Beginner.\nIt seemed no different from when Su Ping had finished its initial Cultivation.\n\"PIP!\" it declared, its voice like dry leaves rustling. \"Master, I am... getting stronger!\"\nThe little Paperman sheathed its paper sword and bowed to Su Ping.\nSu Ping didn’t correct the little Paperman’s form of address.\nAfter all, at this moment, wasn’t the title ’Master’ rightfully his, in a sense?\nSo, after the little Paperman’s meticulous bow, Su Ping said, \"Little guy, would you like to follow me always? To become my ’core disciple’?\"\nThis time, the little Paperman responded almost instantly, its simple paper face seeming to light up with eagerness. \"PIP! I’m willing!\"\nThe little Paperman could feel that the ’Master’ before it was genuinely helping it grow stronger.\nMoreover, it had previously seen how that big dog, with Master’s help, had suddenly become so formidable!\nEven more formidable than before! It also wanted to become that formidable, to learn more Swordsmanship, and defeat more Experts! To become a true top-tier Swordsman!\nHaving truly arrived in this wider world, even though it was currently confined here, the little Paperman could sense many powerful auras.\n\"Good! Get ready! Don’t resist!\"\nThe little Paperman nodded, its simple face showing serene determination as it closed its eyes.\nSeeing the little Paperman close its eyes, Su Ping didn’t immediately establish the Soul Contract to make it his second Contracted Beast.\nOn the contrary, he fell into deep thought.\nBecause Su Ping had thought of a problem that, for him, was truly very, very difficult.\nIf he contracted the little Paperman, he couldn’t still call it ’little Paperman,’ right? The little fellow would need a name, wouldn’t it?\nUndoubtedly, this was a matter more challenging for him than perfecting a Cultivation Secret Technique!",

      "content": "Chapter 120: Chapter 108: The Second Pet Beast! The Opening of the Secret Realm?\nSu Ping thought of the look in his dad, Su Anyong’s, eyes a few days ago, and the sigh-filled words he heard after the name Xiao Qing was mentioned:\n\"Son, when you fight with Plant Type, Wood Element Beast Tamers in the future, it’s best not to call out the little guy’s name directly to command him; just use the Soul Contract. Otherwise, the opponent’s Pet Beast may not know who you’re calling, because their Pet Beast’s nickname might be the same!\"\nThe reason Su Ping hadn’t missed the old man at all after he left was precisely because of his nagging mouth.\nHowever, what the old man said did make some sense.\nThe name Xiao Qing was too common. Of course, now it was impossible to change Xiao Qing’s name, so Su Ping had to put more effort into naming his second Pet Beast.\nSo, as he watched the little Paperman open his eyes in confusion, Su Ping cleared his throat,\n\"From today onwards, as you have officially become my core disciple, it’s time for me to give you a true name!\"\n\"WAH? (A name?)\"\nThe little Paperman was first slightly stunned, then his eyes suddenly lit up. And I mean literally lit up:\n\"WAH! (A name!)\"\n\"WAH... WAH? (Oriental... Blizzard?)\"\nDamn!\nA wave of foreboding suddenly surged in Su Ping’s heart.\nThroughout history, what name of those swordsmen in TV dramas and movies was ever normal?\nAnd clearly, having such names bestowed upon Pet Beasts would be abnormal too.\nIf Su Anyong returned and found out not only had he made a Soul Contract with a Paperman, but had named it ’Oriental Blizzard,’ Su Ping could already fully imagine the state and mannerisms his dad would display!\nSeemingly imagining some horrifying and terrible scene, Su Ping shivered and hastily shook his head.\n\"As my official disciple, you should have a two-character name just like me and Xiao Qing!\"\nHe quickly tried to fix the issue.\nHowever, seeing the little Paperman getting excited, Su Ping felt a headache coming on.\n\"WAH! (Invincible!)\"\n\"WAH! (Flying Goose!)\"\n\"WAH! (Unrivaled!)\"\n\"WAH! (Blizzard!)\"\n\"WAH...\"\n\"Alright!\"\nSu Ping directly called a stop, interrupting the little Paperman’s obsession with ’Blizzard.’ He then summoned his terrifying Chinese Language Gaokao score of 82 points and began racking his brains as swiftly as possible.\nFinally, after much effort, he decided to link his own dream to the young creature before him!\n\"The seed of the Heart of Woods is Xiao Qing! My small goal for the future is to become a Pet Beast Breeding Base worth a hundred billion! So, I’ll call you Qian Yi then!\"\nSu Ping was quite proud of himself.\nWho says I’m bad at naming? Isn’t this name good? It has a nice meaning too.\nIn the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, the term ’myriad spirits’ is used. Beneath ’myriad’ is ’thousand,’ and the unit above it is ’billion.’ Combining these two could also be encompassed by this idea.\nAlso, at first listen, it’s quite catchy. Genius! I am a genius!\nSu Ping was very satisfied.\nAnd it seemed the little Paperman was satisfied too:\n\"WAH! (Qian Yi!)\"\n\"WAH! (Qian Yi!)\"\n\"...\"\nWatching the little Paperman repeating his new name, Su Ping nodded in satisfaction. Thankfully, it seemed the Paperman’s tastes were quite in line with his!\nBut as they communicated telepathically, Su Ping suddenly furrowed his brow after listening for a while.\nHuh? It didn’t seem to be what he had in mind!\n\"WAH! WAH! (Qian Yi! One in a Thousand! I am the mighty swordsman who is one in a thousand!)\"\nSu Ping looked at the little Paperman, who had apparently excitedly accepted the name, in confusion.\nHuh? Is this the name I wanted to give? Is this it?\nBut seeing the little Paperman so happy it couldn’t find north, Su Ping nodded.New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nYes! This was it! Qian Yi! That was the name he had chosen for the little Paperman!\nFacing the little Paperman Qian Yi’s excited and admiring gaze, Su Ping finally said, a little after the fact,\n\"Alright, get ready, don’t resist!\"\nQian Yi: (๑-◡-๑)\nThis time, Su Ping no longer hesitated. He slowly connected his soul to the little Paperman Qian Yi before him. That familiar sensation enveloped both him and the Paperman once again.\nIt wasn’t a connection of blood, but rather one of souls intertwined. Like a bridge opening to traffic, it completely interlinked him with the little Paperman.\nThis sensation made Su Ping’s soul feel as though it had suddenly gained a burden-bearing strength.\nThough the little Paperman’s power was weak and its Realm was low, such a fresh force’s arrival still allowed Su Ping’s recently broken-through spiritual power to advance a small step forward.\nAlthough the effect of this step wasn’t major, there was still some distance to reaching the Elite Level, Second Rank.\nAfter breaking through to the Elite Level, Su Ping clearly felt that while the power feedback from upgrading Pet Beasts didn’t change, the difficulty of his own promotions increased.\nHowever, this might be the case for Su Ping the Beast Tamer. But for the little Paperman Qian Yi, it was like directly consuming an unimaginably miraculous elixir. Upon the Soul Contract with Su Ping, it felt an immense amount of power feedback.\nThis power allowed the little Paperman, already at its Peak, to change its aura immediately. Its Level finally broke through, reaching the Common Tenth Level!\nThis was also, generally speaking, the theoretical race limit for the Paperman, an Undead Pet Beast.\n\"WAH!\"\nLittle Paperman Qian Yi opened his eyes in excitement. His choice had clearly not been wrong.",

Sure enough, having just successfully become its disciple, its strength had once again improved.\nThe little Paperman was eager to try. Only by working hard constantly could it live up to its master’s trust and help!\nIf Su Ping weren’t still there, the little Paperman would have already planned to continue practicing drawing its sword ten thousand times and thrusting ten thousand times, using the methods taught by its master.\nHowever, quite obviously, the little Paperman’s wish to continue working hard was unfulfilled because Su Ping, unable to sleep, had brought it to the place where they first met—the banks of the Lingxi River. He lay there on the lawn formed by Wolf Tobacco.\nCome to think of it, Wolf Tobacco had no particular smell before it was processed and burned.\nEven so, it had a stronger Life Force than common grass. Even though it was clearly autumn, it still grew extremely dense and lush.\nThe little Paperman, Qian Yi, didn’t know why its master had brought it here.\nIn fact, Su Ping just had nothing better to do.\nHe wanted to understand the little Paperman better and still had many questions about that Secret Realm, so he had simply picked a random place.\nPreviously, the little Paperman hadn’t hidden anything from Su Ping.\nHowever, the little Paperman’s intelligence and its innate ability for Telepathic Communication were still relatively rudimentary.\nFor many specific questions, Su Ping could not get a definite answer.\nNow, with the Soul Contract connecting them, Su Ping felt he could further question the little Paperman about the Secret Realm.\nSo, he thought for a moment and asked, \"Qian Yi, in your home, have you seen any companions like yourself?\"\nThis was a question Qian Yi previously couldn’t answer accurately.\nEven when using nods for yes and shakes of the head for no, the little Paperman’s behavior of nodding and shaking its head simultaneously had confused Su Ping.\nBut this time, with the effect of the soul connection, Su Ping finally understood the little Paperman’s complex message:\n\"EEEP! (Yes... but they are not the same as Qian Yi!)\"\nHuh?\nClearly, such an answer was enough to prove that there were other beings in this Secret Realm. However, Qian Yi’s meaning was also quite clear: although there were Pet Beasts in the Secret Realm, they were not Papermen like itself.\nUndoubtedly, this sparked even greater curiosity in Su Ping.\nAlthough he hadn’t bought any real Papermen for a thorough study during this time, he had used the fragmented spare moments—time others might spend browsing short videos—to search and read a considerable amount of data.\nThis data was even downloaded from the Breeder Association.\nHe also understood.\nPapermen were a very special Undead Race, like Skeleton Soldiers; if they didn’t evolve, individuals were very weak.\nA Paperman, let alone surviving, even its birth was very peculiar.\nHowever, considering the Sword Soul Mark on the little Paperman and its Perfect Level Jinge Technique, Su Ping felt that this peculiarity seemed tolerable.\nSo, Su Ping didn’t rush to ask again about the situation in the Secret Realm. Instead, he thought for a moment, but couldn’t resist his curiosity and asked Qian Yi directly, \"Qian Yi, can you use the Sword Soul Mark skill?!\"\nThe little Paperman tilted its head slightly, then looked at Su Ping in surprise.\nThe next second, a ripple in space appeared, and the little Paperman vanished without a trace.\nClearly, it had returned directly to that Mysterious Realm Space.\n\"Huh?\" Su Ping was also stunned.\nWas the Sword Soul Mark simply a portal back to the Secret Realm?\nCome to think of it, when the little Paperman first mastered this spatial doorway, Su Ping had thought he’d encountered a rare spatial-Attribute Pet Beast.\nBut it seemed that wasn’t the case after all.\nBut really, did this skill only have this one effect?\nSpace rippled again, and the next second, the little Paperman reappeared beside Su Ping.\nSo, Su Ping thought for a moment. \"Qian Yi, try infusing your Energy into this Sword Soul Mark again.\"\nThe little Paperman didn’t understand what he meant, but it seemed it really hadn’t tried it before.\nFor the little Paperman, this Sword Soul Mark seemed to be an instinctual ability, like eating and drinking for a normal person. Although it did consume some stamina, it was essentially negligible.\nAnd what would happen if one used all their might—the kind used for suckling—on an instinctual action like eating or drinking?\nObviously, no one in their right mind would likely try such a thing.\nHowever, under its master’s command, the little Paperman meticulously chose to execute it!\nBut this time, a scene Su Ping had never witnessed before slowly unfolded before his eyes!\nAt that moment, Qian Yi, who had previously only differed in outward appearance from ordinary Papermen, slowly began to manifest a faint shadow on its body.\nThis shadow was nothing other than a sword!\nIt appeared on the little Paperman’s body, behind it, like a strange cross disproportionate to its size.\nThe next moment, Su Ping’s breath caught in his throat.\nFrom the void, it felt as if something in the great unknown had responded. If he had to make a comparison, it was somewhat similar to when he advanced to the Elite Level and his Beast Taming Space awakened its Space Characteristics.\nIt just wasn’t as dramatic.\nUnder the call of this sword shadow, right there on the bank of the Lingxi River, it was as if water from another dimension had spilled into this space. A ripple spread out, and then, right before Su Ping’s stunned eyes, a portal large enough for one person to pass through appeared.\nHad the gate to the Secret Realm opened?!\n...\n「Linzhou City Center.」\nHigh up in an Advanced Level apartment building, within a dark room, a pair of eyes snapped open, illuminating the pitch-black space like a beacon.\nThe next moment, the lights came on. Dong Muyun’s beautiful eyes furrowed. Then, with a thought, a silver light gleamed.\n\"CHIRP CHIRP!\"\nThe Soaring Fish’s calls and movements startled Dong Muyun from her meditation.\n\"What’s wrong?\"\nDong Muyun’s brows knitted slightly.\nThrough their Soul Contract, she already sensed the reason for the Soaring Fish’s agitation.\n\"The spatial marker you left has had a huge reaction?!\"\nEver since completely falling out with Su Ping and realizing she had no way of dealing with that young troublemaker, Dong Muyun had not returned to Yuntian Resort.\nAs the chairman of Tianyun Group, Dong Muyun was hardly idle.\nShe had decided that out of sight was out of mind.\nBut unexpectedly, she still couldn’t escape it.\nFeeling the Soaring Fish’s agitation, Dong Muyun eventually couldn’t hold back.\nAlthough her negotiations with that brat had collapsed, and even if she didn’t have exploration rights, surely just taking a look wouldn’t hurt?\nDamn it. A few years back, its Soaring Fish had a breakthrough and mastered the Special Skill ’Spatial Perception.’ While passing by a suburban area, it unexpectedly detected a peculiar reaction from the Heart of Woods. From this, she realized the space here was fragile and an unknown Secret Realm might descend.\nThen, she began to make preparations.\nYears went by, and not only did she come up empty-handed, but she also attracted a load of trouble.\nHowever, no matter what, this was a Secret Realm she had been curious about and anticipating for years.\nIf she didn’t see what kind of Secret Realm it was, what lay within, which historical Beast Tamer powerhouse might have left it, and what type of Pet Beasts predominated there, Dong Muyun knew she would truly not be content.\nSo, without a second thought, she calmed the frantically chirping Soaring Fish, then put on a pair of gold-rimmed glasses and said in a low voice, \"Yunning, switch to flight mode!\"\n\"Master, you are currently in Linzhou City Center and not in a combat state. There are sky surveillance devices in the city center. Unauthorized flight without a permit will result in being photographed and fined. Are you sure you wish to enter flight mode?\"\nThe mechanical voice did not faze Dong Muyun.\nAlthough the influence and privileges of the prominent families and Beast Tamer clans had greatly diminished since that person took power, she could still handle such a minor issue.\n\"Confirm!\"\nInstantly, what looked like liquid metal flowed from the pendant around Dong Muyun’s neck, covering her.\nIt formed an extremely compact suit of battle armor. Then, from the window of the apartment, a hundred meters high, she leaped out.Follow current novels on ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet",

Qin Erlong’s Shock!\nSu Ping stared at the Secret Realm vortex before him, stunned for perhaps a third of a second before striding toward it, stopping just half a meter away.\nOf course, he did not enter recklessly but instead sized up the spatial portal.\nWas this the Secret Realm that someone like Dong Muyun had been fixated on all this time?\nHowever, before he could react, a faint voice emanated from it:\n\"Beast Tamers may enter the Sword Secret Realm. Those who find the Sword Soul Mark within the Sword Tomb may receive the Sword Inheritance! Entrants must not be stronger than Commander Level. Those above will be suppressed to Commander Level strength while inside.\"\nThe voice wasn’t loud, but it was extremely clear!\nSword Inheritance? The Sword Secret Realm... isn’t this the Necromancy Series Secret Realm I had in mind?\nSu Ping blinked.\nAnd most importantly, the Sword Soul Mark...\nSu Ping looked at the little paperman beside him, who still maintained its pose, but the ethereal sword-shaped shadow on its body had disappeared.\nAbruptly, Su Ping seemed to sense something. With a thought, the little paperman’s body was taken into his Beast Taming Space.\nThe next moment, a figure appeared beside him, descending from the sky accompanied by jets of flame!\nShe wore mechanical armor that clung to her curvaceous body like liquid mercury.The most update n0vels are published on NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nThe headpiece of the armor revealed Dong Muyun’s face, her long hair flowing.\nSu Ping breathed a sigh of relief. Even though the little paperman had been recalled into the Beast Taming Space, the gate to the Secret Realm still remained.\nClearly, as long as the Sword Soul Mark was activated, the gate to this Secret Realm would open.\nDong Muyun’s gaze was firmly fixed on the sight before her, an irrepressible excitement gleaming in her beautiful eyes.\nIt’s finally opened!\nAfter waiting for so many years, even making so many preparations, the gate to the Secret Realm has finally opened!\nDong Muyun took a deep breath, almost wanting to enter it right then, but then she saw Su Ping’s unfriendly glare blocking her path.\n\"Ms. Dong, I hope you’ll conduct yourself with propriety. This is my house; you’re currently trespassing on private property.\"\nDong Muyun suppressed the impulse to have Yunning split this brat in two, took another deep breath, and said,\n\"Su Ping, I truly mean no harm. You should know that with your current strength, developing this Secret Realm will be a difficult and lengthy task. Why not collaborate? We can quickly develop this Secret Realm together, and your growth and advancement could be much faster!\"\nDong Muyun had a point. Su Ping pretended to ponder for a moment, then nodded.\nPreviously, Su Ping would have preferred to collaborate with the Beast Master Association, or even seek out that so-called official Qintian Monitor. He would absolutely not have been willing to cooperate with these capitalists.\nBut now, knowing what this Secret Realm was really all about, he agreed to Dong Muyun’s proposal almost instantly.\nThis is an inheritance-type Secret Realm!\nIt’s a Secret Realm left by ancient Beast Tamers to pass on their legacy and recruit disciples!\nAnd the key to unlocking this inheritance was the little paperman, Qian Yi!\nSo, besides this Sword Inheritance, what other truly valuable treasures could there be in this so-called Sword Tomb?\nObviously, even if there were any, they wouldn’t be the most precious ones.\nSo, through this so-called cooperation, I could definitely use these seemingly trivial things to get some benefits from Dong Muyun!\nThus, Su Ping pretended to think for a moment and said,\n\"What kind of cooperation do you have in mind?\"\n\"I only need twenty-four hours of exploration time! After twenty-four hours, I will definitely leave. As for what I find, you can decide on the split, or you can name any resources you want as compensation—it’s all negotiable!\"\nSu Ping’s eyes lit up:\n\"Anything at all?!\"\nAn irrepressible joy flashed in Dong Muyun’s eyes.\nA Beast Taming Space expands over time after its master’s death, but twenty-four hours would be enough for me to plunder a Secret Realm thoroughly!\nThis kid actually agreed!\nSo, Boss Dong, with a grand and decisive wave of her hand, declared:\n\"Anything at all!\"\n\"One Spirit Saint Level or Legendary Level Pet Beast cub, and three Spiritual Level Resources. Is that possible?\"\nWatching this seemingly philanthropic goddess before him, Su Ping blinked with innocent eyes.\nAnd then, the goddess transformed into a harpy:\n\"Possible? In your dreams...\"\nDong Muyun forcefully swallowed the expletive that had nearly slipped out and stared firmly at Su Ping:\n\"Items like those are nowhere near the value of a Secret Realm! Don’t even mention that I don’t have them; even if I did, I wouldn’t trade them. After all, we still don’t even know what this Secret Realm is really like!\nHow about this: the Yuntian Resort was built specifically for this Secret Realm. After I’m done exploring, I’ll transfer everything to you—including the equipment, personnel, and facilities. I’ll hand it all over to you, lock, stock, and barrel!\"\nSu Ping was actually somewhat tempted:\n\"It’s still not enough!\"\nDong Muyun sighed. \"Then what else do you want?\"\nSu Ping narrowed his eyes, his gaze sweeping up and down Dong Muyun’s shapely figure.\nDong Muyun involuntarily took a step back, looking at this brat with a mixture of alarm and shock.\nHe dares to set his sights on me?\nBut the next second, she realized she had misunderstood.\n\"Ms. Dong, that Mechanical Pet Beast of yours is truly amazing.\"\n\"Alright!\" Dong Muyun nodded.\n\"Besides Yun Tian, I’ll give you one Mechanical Core. That should be enough, right?\"\n\"Ten!\"\nSu Ping immediately shot for the stars!\n\"Impossible! Mechanical Cores are strategic resources, and their value isn’t comparable to those constructs made from failed Mechanical Core awakenings! Two. That’s my bottom line!\"",

Dong Muyun finally couldn’t hold back.\nAfter haggling for over half an hour, can I finally go in and investigate?\nHowever, just as she was about to step forward, the Secret Realm’s vortex, which had been present all along, gradually dissipated into nothingness.\n\"What’s going on?\"\nSu Ping glanced at the little Paperman in his Beast Taming Space, who had fainted from energy depletion, and touched his nose somewhat awkwardly. \"Could it be because the space is still unstable and cannot maintain a fixed existence?\"\nDong Muyun nodded. \"That’s possible. But since the gate to the Secret Realm has already appeared, it should only be a matter of a few days. Perfect, come to Yun Tian tomorrow and sign the contract.\"\nWithout a signed contract, Dong Muyun truly worried that this cunning young man might resort to other tricks.\nFortunately, Su Ping thought the same.\nHe had even considered things more thoroughly than she had.\n「The next morning, Su Ping waited at his own doorstep.」\nHe was respectfully demure, like a young bride meeting her in-laws for the first time.\nIn fact, in a certain sense, it was indeed quite similar.\nSu Ping didn’t have to wait too long.\nSoon after, an ordinary car stopped at the entrance of the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base.\nAnd a figure he hadn’t seen in a long time emerged from it.\n\"President Qin!\" Su Ping bowed respectfully.\nYes, the person before him was none other than Qin Erlong, President of the Jianghai Province Beast Master Association.\nQin Erlong smiled warmly and nodded. \"Xiao Xue mentioned it to me before, and I’ve been waiting for news from you. This is good timing; I also want to see exactly what this new Secret Realm is like.\"\nFor ordinary people, the appearance of a Secret Realm was a rare event, but for Qin Erlong, it clearly wasn’t an uncommon occurrence.\n\"Thank you for your concern, President Qin. It’s mainly regarding the Tianyun Group. Without an elder overseeing things, I wouldn’t feel at ease...\"\n\"Don’t worry. With me here, no one can force you to do anything. However, I didn’t expect you to choose to cooperate with Tianyun.\"\nQin Erlong smiled and said, \"Alright, aren’t you going to sign the contract with that young lady from the Dong Family? Let’s go.\"\nSu Ping smiled and then proceeded with Qin Erlong into Yun Tian. With Dong Muyun’s instructions, they naturally encountered no obstacles and arrived at her office.\nDong Muyun had been waiting there. Seeing Su Ping finally arrive, she began, \"You’re finally here. I...\"\nHer words caught in her throat. Seeing the smiling Qin Erlong behind Su Ping, her expression suddenly became incredibly complicated!\nQin Erlong smiled faintly. \"Little Su was uneasy, so he asked me to come and take a look. Young lady Dong, you don’t mind, do you?\"\nDong Muyun quickly put on a radiant smile. \"Of course not! It’s my honor to see you, Elder Qin. Please, have a seat.\"\nShe glanced aside at Su Ping, her eyes filled with a hint of resentment.\nWas this necessary? It was just signing a contract; was it really that serious? I did consider having my lawyer tinker with the contract, but did he really need to bring *him* to supervise?\nBut obviously, what could she say at this moment?\nShe shot a look at her lawyer, then personally took the teapot and poured a cup of tea for Qin Erlong.\n\"Elder Qin, this is the Flaming Heart Tea my father recently acquired. It has a robust flavor. Please try it.\"\nQin Erlong took a sip and nodded. \"Not bad. How has Dong Lingtian been recently?\"\n\"Thanks to your good wishes, Father is in good health.\"\nSu Ping watched, and seeing that Dong Muyun had no intention of pouring him any, he simply picked up the teapot and poured himself a cup.\nUnder Dong Muyun’s unfriendly gaze, he also took a sip. \"Indeed, it’s good tea.\"\nQin Erlong, unconcerned, chuckled. \"I’ve heard about Little Su’s situation. The emergence of a Secret Realm in Linzhou is a good thing! Little Su’s conditions aren’t excessive. This is a mutually beneficial arrangement for you both.\"\n\"Yes!\"\nIn fact, despite Dong Muyun’s firm stance the previous day, Su Ping’s asking price, as Qin Erlong said, was not unreasonable.\nThey exchanged pleasantries, and an entire morning passed before the lawyer returned with two copies of the contract.\nSu Ping didn’t rush to read it but handed it directly to Qin Erlong. The latter scanned it briefly and then nodded.\nOnce the contracts were signed and names written, Su Ping and Dong Muyun both let out a simultaneous sigh of relief.\nOnly after copies were printed and retained by each party was the matter truly settled.\nSu Ping was also extremely excited.\nMechanical Cores! His father’s ultra-shadow and the Breeder Association’s compression machine were both results of failed awakenings with Mechanical Cores! Yet, their value was already unimaginably high. And now, I’ve managed to swindle four Intelligent Cores just like that?\nDong Muyun was also quite satisfied.\nNo matter what, a huge weight had been lifted from her heart.\nLooking at Su Ping, he no longer seemed so detestable. She immediately said with a smile, \"A pleasure doing business with you. It’s lunchtime, Elder Qin, Su, would you like to stay for a meal?\"\nClearly, Dong Muyun was just being polite, but to her surprise, both Su Ping and Qin Erlong nodded. \"That would be nice.\"\nAt the dinner table, after everything was settled, Dong Muyun finally dared to start making some pointed remarks. \"Student Su, you’re so handsome and exceptionally talented. You must have had many girls interested in you during your school days, right? I wonder if you’ve ever had a girlfriend?\"\nSu Ping glanced at this meddling woman.\nSetting aside the fact that my relationship with Qin Xiaoxue is innocent, even if there were something, what could your few words possibly do? Besides, is this even trying to cause trouble? This is clearly divine assistance to prevent me, Su Ping, from marrying into their family!\nSo, Su Ping nodded and said, \"I have!\"\nHe really has?\nDong Muyun was stunned.\nThis kid actually dared to admit it!\nShe immediately grew excited and looked towards Qin Erlong.\nTo her slight surprise, Qin Erlong wasn’t angry at all. Instead, he smiled and nodded. \"Not bad. Experiencing some relationships when young helps one mature and take things more seriously later on. Like me, back in the day...\"\nHuh? What the hell? It can be like that?\nDong Muyun nearly choked on a mouthful of rice she had just swallowed. She hurriedly took two sips of water and said awkwardly under the surprised gazes of Qin Erlong and Su Ping, \"Sorry, something went down the wrong way...\"\nHowever, just as she said this, Dong Muyun’s expression suddenly changed. It wasn’t just her; Qin Erlong, beside her, also raised an eyebrow.\n\"What’s wrong?\" Su Ping asked, noticing the change in their expressions.\nQin Erlong smiled slightly, a look of interest on his face. \"Your family’s Secret Realm—it’s appeared again!\"\nHmm?\nSu Ping instinctively glanced at the little Paperman in his Beast Taming Space.\nThe little Paperman is still there, and it hasn’t fully recovered from last night’s energy depletion yet!\nBut Su Ping quickly realized!\nThis time, it wasn’t summoned by the little Paperman; the gate to this Secret Realm had truly formed on its own.\nInstantly, the three of them wasted no more time, soaring into the air and arriving at the familiar bank of the Lingxi River.\nSure enough, a spatial vortex was slowly materializing on the bank of the stream.\nDong Muyun, looking at this spatial vortex, almost without a second thought, stepped inside.\nThe contract was signed; her right to explore was a matter of course.\nSu Ping, on the other hand, hesitated slightly.\nUltimately, he made up his mind!\nAt the same time, Qin Erlong turned his head, frowning slightly. \"Little Su, this Secret Realm has restrictions. At my Level, I can no longer force my way in. Otherwise, the Secret Realm might fracture. If you want to enter, be mentally prepared.\"\nSu Ping nodded. After a word with Qin Erlong, he quickly ran towards his front yard.\nQin Erlong was somewhat puzzled, but then, thinking about the situation at Su Ping’s home, he nodded in understanding.\nExploring a Secret Realm wasn’t like a Pet Beast battle in an arena; naturally, one could use non-Contracted Beasts.\nIt must be that Commander Level Old Forest Wolf I saw when I visited last time, right?\nSure enough, Qin Erlong didn’t have to wait long.\nSu Ping returned, but this time, there were three figures behind him.\nQin Erlong didn’t quite register it at first.\nHe immediately spotted the two Commander Level Forest Wolves!\nIs this kid’s family background so substantial? Two Commander Level Forest Wolves that have broken through their race limit?\nThe most update n0vels are published on ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nHowever, soon, Qin Erlong’s pupils suddenly constricted. He looked behind Su Ping in disbelief.\nA figure that, at first glance, resembled a Kylin, appeared before his eyes.\nWhat kind of Pet Beast is that?",

First Battle with the Wanmu Wolf!\nThe long, willow branch-like fur draped down like a straw raincoat, some strands even reaching the ground.\nThe Y-shaped horns formed by tree branches resembled those of the mythical Kylin!\nBut that massive wolf head clearly proved this was a wolf!\nAnd obviously an Evolutionary Body of a Forest Wolf!\nWhat Pet Beast was this?\nAlmost immediately, Qin Erlong had an answer in his heart.\nThe Wanmu Wolf!\nThe only one that could appear here was the Wanmu Wolf!\nBecause he had been a witness, he knew about the wager between Sun Chaoju and Su Ping.\nNaturally, he also knew the final outcome.\nIt was Su Ping who had obtained the incomplete Evolution Law for the Wanmu Wolf!\nHe had even complained multiple times to Old Liu because of this Wanmu Wolf’s Evolution Law.\nHow could a young man like Su Ping have figured it out in such a short amount of time?\nThey had squandered the budding romantic period between Su Ping and his granddaughter without properly strengthening their bond.\nHowever, at this very moment, the appearance of this wolf, as majestic as a Kylin, had pushed all other thoughts from Qin Erlong’s mind.\nAs the president of the Jianghai Beastmaster Association, he was acutely aware of what the emergence of this Evolutionary Body signified!\nQin Erlong suddenly looked towards Su Ping, his eyes firmly locked on the young figure.\nHe still wanted to confirm. \"Wanmu Wolf?\"\nGazing back at Qin Erlong, Su Ping nodded. \"Yes!\"\nA burst of spiritual power erupted uncontrollably from Qin Erlong. It wasn’t an attack, but rather an immense spiritual reaction, somewhat unseemly for someone of his Realm, indicating his loss of composure.\nHad this young man really done it? How was this possible?\nEven that old fellow Liu Fuhai had said it would be very difficult to complete the Wanmu Wolf’s evolution in a short amount of time!\nBut obviously, difficult did not mean entirely impossible.\nEventually, Qin Erlong’s expression slowly returned to normal, yet he was immersed in thought. He looked at Su Ping with a slight frown. \"Little Su, are you planning to take this Wanmu Wolf into the Secret Realm?\"\n\"Yes! I want to see what’s really inside!\"\nIf this were before, Qin Erlong wouldn’t have stopped him. Every powerful Beast Tamer must face danger and battle.\nBut now, things were completely different. Su Ping’s value was so great that it was neither necessary nor worth him taking such a risk!\nSo, he stated decisively, \"No!\"\nSu Ping was somewhat helpless. \"Old Qin...\"\nIn truth, he had some confidence. He already understood the situation within the Secret Realm: the strongest entities should be at the Commander Level.\nOtherwise, the restrictions of the Secret Realm wouldn’t be set at the Commander Level.\nMoreover, he was confident in Old Sha’s strength.\nSeeming to notice Su Ping’s determination, Qin Erlong furrowed his brow slightly, then sighed and nodded. The next moment, a light flared.\nThis was another Mechanical Pet Beast.\nHowever, unlike Dong Muyun’s armor, Qin Erlong’s Mechanical Pet Beast seemed rather bulky.\nIt was a massive, oval-shaped sphere floating in the air, somewhat resembling a legendary UFO.\nQin Erlong stretched out his hand, and a tiny, button-like object floated out from the UFO. The aura of this floating, UFO-like Mechanical Pet Beast weakened instantly. \"Keep this on you! If you encounter danger, just crush it. It will instantly release a protective shield and fluctuations exceeding what this Secret Realm can handle, ensuring your safety and pulling you directly out of the Secret Realm.\"\n\"Old Qin, this...\"\nSu Ping felt somewhat embarrassed; it was obvious to him that such an item must be extremely valuable.\n\"Take it. Either you hold onto it and enter, or I find people right now—ten Commander Level Beast Tamers—to protect you as you go in. Or, you can just stay put here for me. I’ve made a promise to Xiao Xue that I won’t let you get into trouble.\"\nSu Ping reluctantly took the strange button and attached it to his wrist.\nOnly then did Qin Erlong relax and smile slightly. \"Alright, go in!\"\nSu Ping took a deep breath. Looking at the spinning spatial vortex before him, he no longer hesitated and stepped in!\nIt felt like riding a rollercoaster, perhaps even more thrilling.\nHis brain seemed to have been shaken into mush. Then, as his world spun, the next second, he appeared in a peculiar place.\nSu Ping instinctively patted himself down. Old Sha and the two Commander Level Forest Wolves he had named Da Zhuang and Er Zhuang were still there, which was a relief.\nMeanwhile, just after he entered, a voice, similar to the one from yesterday, echoed in Su Ping’s ear:\n[Enter the Sword Tomb, find the Sword Soul Mark, ascend to the pinnacle of the Sword Tomb to activate the mark, and unlock the Sword Inheritance! Those within the Sword Tomb can communicate with the Secret Realm at any time using their spiritual power to open the door to leave the realm.]Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nJust as expected!\nA hint of a smile touched Su Ping’s lips.\nHis father had told him that Secret Realms originating from the Beast Taming Spaces of ancient and mighty Beast Tamers generally fell into two categories.\nOne was when the Beast Tamer died by accident. In such cases, all the Traits of the Beast Taming Space remained intact, and with the passage of time, various Pet Beasts and resources would emerge.\nSuch Secret Realms were extremely dangerous. Besides the perilous locations formed by these Traits over time, there were also Pet Beasts that had never come into contact with a Beast Tamer.",

First Battle with the Wanmu Wolf!_2\nThe other type involved those who foresaw their own death and subsequently transformed their Beast Taming Space into a Land of Inheritance.\nGenerally speaking, the latter posed no great danger. It served to find a suitable successor to pass on their unique methods of Pet Beast Cultivation.\nClearly, this Sword Secret Realm was just such a place.\nWith his mind relaxed, Su Ping finally turned his attention to his surroundings.\nTypically, the terrain of a Secret Realm is very simplistic. This was because such realms were an evolution of a Beast Tamer’s traits.\nThis place, known as the Sword Tomb, was exactly like that.\nDark rocks, a chain of several mountain peaks, and a desolation utterly devoid of greenery. Yet, even more eerie was the sight of swords thrust everywhere into this barren land.\nAs far as Su Ping’s eyes could see, he didn’t spot any living creatures—only swords, and more swords!\nSome of these swords were broken, others pristine. Some were strewn carelessly on the ground; others stood upright, embedded directly in the earth—a vast and varied collection.\nSo, this is the so-called Sword Tomb? It really lives up to its name.\nSu Ping thought.\nA slight smile touched his lips as he looked up. Even in this Secret Realm, there was a sun.\nAs long as the sun is here, I fear nothing! So, praise the sun!\nDong Muyun had already vanished, clearly intending to use this time to search frantically.\nSu Ping was not to be outdone.\nHe looked towards the dark mountain peak in the distance.\nDong Muyun needs to search this Sword Tomb for the Sword Soul Mark, but I can go directly to the summit of the highest peak to accept the so-called Sword Inheritance!\nWith this in mind, Su Ping waved his hand, and his talent, Pet Beast Home, finally took effect. He released all twenty Elite Forest Wolves he had stored in his Beast Taming Space.\nUnder the command of his Heart Vision, twenty-three Forest Wolves—including Old Sha, Da Zhuang, and Er Zhuang—flanked Su Ping at the center as they advanced towards the distant peak of the Sword Tomb.\n「...」\nSword Inheritance?\nOutside the Secret Realm, by the banks of the Lingxi River, Su Ping couldn’t possibly imagine what was happening. Qin Erlong was sitting on a small stool as if by magic. In front of him, the giant UFO projected a light screen.\nAt the center of this light screen was Su Ping.\nObviously, the button’s effect wasn’t limited to protection; it also included location tracking and live broadcasting.\nUpon realizing this was an inheritance-type Secret Realm, Old Qin sighed in relief and then mused aloud, \"Which powerful ancient Beast Tamers were renowned for the sword? Damn, there really are quite a few.\"\nGenerally, only a Beast Tamer of Emperor Level or above could have their Beast Taming Space evolve into a Secret Realm. Thus, powerful ancient Beast Tamers who left behind Secret Realms could usually be traced through historical records.\nHowever, for Beast Tamers specializing in Instrument Type Pet Beasts, a ’sword’ or Sword-type Pet Beast was a common possession.\nAs for which specific sword-wielding Beast Tamer it might be, it’s truly difficult to tell from such scant clues.\nThinking of this, Old Qin felt somewhat regretful and shook his head helplessly, muttering, \"An inheritance-type Secret Realm, huh? What was that kid thinking, insisting on partnering with that Dong Family girl?\"\nIn an inheritance-type Secret Realm, if that Dong Family girl obtained the Sword Inheritance first, its value would far exceed a few mere Mechanical Cores.\nOld Qin couldn’t puzzle this out and didn’t dwell on it further, instead focusing his gaze on the screen before him.\nBecause in the live broadcast from this ’UFO,’ Su Ping, traversing through the Sword Tomb, finally encountered his first obstacle!\nOld Qin’s interest was piqued. \"This terrain isn’t very conducive for Forest Wolves to exert their strength...\"\nSu Ping exhaled slowly. He had anticipated that even an inheritance-type Secret Realm wouldn’t be entirely smooth sailing, but he hadn’t expected trouble to arrive so quickly.\nIt was a sword.\nIt seemed no different from the others nearby. However, Su Ping had already checked them; the swords on the ground were all dilapidated and worthless.\nBut the one before him now, while still a sword, wasn’t lying on the ground—it was flying in the sky!\nThe Eye of Truth immediately provided Su Ping with feedback:\n[Rotten Sword]\n[Attribute: Gold]\n[Current Level: Elite Second Rank]\n[Racial Potential: Elite Sixth Rank]\n[Skills: Jinge Technique (Proficient), Sword Body (Proficiency)]\nAnd for an Elite Level Instrument Type Pet Beast, aren’t its skills too few?\nHowever, before he could ponder further, the Rotten Sword seemed to be enraged by Su Ping’s Eye of Truth. A golden light flashed from it—the Jinge Technique, which Su Ping knew all too well.\nUnfortunately, such an attack didn’t even require Old Sha to intervene.\nDa Zhuang, beside him, let out a low growl.\nTough vines instantly shot out, forming a barrier in front. They intercepted the Rotten Sword, which was streaking towards them like a flying blade. The vines then swiftly wrapped around the long sword.\nThe next moment, Da Zhuang exerted a bit of force. The vines, which should have been fragile, directly snapped the Rotten Sword in two!\nIt fell to the ground with a CLANG, then lay motionless.\nIs this my first time successfully commanding a Pet Beast to kill an enemy?\nStaring at the motionless Rotten Sword, such a thought involuntarily surfaced in Su Ping’s mind.\nHowever, I can’t just leave this Sword Body. After all, it’s the body of an Elite Level Instrument Type Pet Beast. It should still have some value, right?",

Wasn’t it said that the Metal Element relatively restrains the Wood Element?\nHowever, he very quickly realized just how wrong his thoughts were.\nAfter he dispatched the Rotten Sword, it was as if he had poked a hornet’s nest. As he crossed the hillside, the sharp clang of ringing swords echoed throughout the area.\nBefore his eyes, more than ten longswords floated in the sky.\nMost were the same Rotten Swords as before. Only at the very top floated a Sword Device, utterly different from the other grey-white longswords, emitting an unusual aura.\nIt was an azure longsword, emitting a cold chill.\nUnfortunately, the aura it exuded, which Su Ping could sense, was undoubtedly of the Commanding Rank. Thus, his Eye of Truth could not discern this Artifact Pet Beast’s Race or Skills!\nHowever, it was clear that all the Artifact Pet Beasts within this Sword Tomb were extremely hostile to outsiders! Without a word, they attacked directly.\nSWOOSH!\nThe sound of rending air heralded the imminent battle!\nThis was the true Pet Beast combat Su Ping had anticipated, and it was the group battle he most looked forward to!\nThis wasn’t a drill!\nThis wasn’t a drill!\nThis was the real deal: commanding a Wolf pack against other Races of Pet Beasts.\nImmediately, Su Ping let out a loud shout, \"Old Sha!\"\nAWOOO!\nAt this moment, Old Sha was even more excited than Su Ping!\nWith a loud howl, Old Sha faced the rapidly flying swords. Instantly, on this lifeless, black earth, verdant trees erupted from the ground.\nTree Prison!\nIt resembled giant pythons coiling forth.\nAmidst these artificially created trees, the Forest Wolf pack seemed even more excited.\nAlmost simultaneously, the Forest Wolves activated their Skills. Under the cover of the trees, branches and vines intertwined, and in mere moments, the area transformed into a jungle!\nBut that wasn’t all!\nOld Sha roared again: Language of Nature!\nIn an instant, the entwining branches and vines seemed to completely submerge the hill!\nThe endless cold emanating from the icy Commander Level longsword was utterly unable to hinder the spread and engulfment of the forest torrent!\nWho said this wasn’t the Forest Wolves’ home ground? If it wasn’t, then we’ll make it our battleground!\n\"This is...\"\nQin Erlong stood up incredulously from his folding stool, staring in amazement at the scene unfolding on the screen!\nCapable of creating a jungle directly?\nThis Ability alone was enough to make the Wanmu Wolf one of the best Evolutionary Bodies for the Forest Wolf.\nEven the Crown Wolf Emperor might not be able to match the Wanmu Wolf in this Ability, right?\nMost importantly, in this situation, the Forest Wolves battled within the created jungle. Even if the Rotten Swords occasionally struck them, as long as it wasn’t a vital spot, they could rely on the Heart of Woods’ Ability to absorb the Life Force from the jungle for Rapid Recovery!\nThis meant that as long as the Wanmu Wolf didn’t fall, the combat power of these Forest Wolves would be boosted to an unimaginable level for their tier!\nAmazing!\nThis was truly amazing!\nQin Erlong stared intently at the scene on the screen.\nHe couldn’t hold back anymore and immediately took out his phone to send a message to Vice President Liu, \"You old rascal, you owe me a big one!\"\nNonsense. This was the Evolutionary Body his chosen future grandson-in-law had fully developed! If Su Ping, with this, were to achieve fame alongside him at the Breeder Competition in the future, of course, that old rascal owed him a huge favor!",

      "content": "Chapter 127: Chapter 111: The Terrifying Forest Flood! Activation of the Legacy!\n\"The Forest Wolf is one of Jianghai Province’s representative Pet Beasts, and also one of the iconic Pet Beasts to have originated here,\" Vice President Liu began.\n\"Its breeding costs are not high, and while its available evolution paths are few, it possesses considerable potential...\n\"In the upcoming half year, you can choose the Forest Wolf as your primary research subject.\"\nWithin the Breeder Association, Vice President Liu was followed by a group of young Breeders.\nJianghai Province and the neighboring Huaiyang Province had conducted an exchange of Junior Breeders. Jianghai had sent a batch over, and evidently, those following Vice President Liu Fuhai right now were this batch of Junior Breeders from Huaiyang Province.\nIn the Breeder Association’s breeding park, Pet Beasts were specially cultivated for the association’s use.\nAnd Vice President Liu, walking at the forefront, was smiling as he introduced it to these visiting Junior Breeder prospects.\n\"Mr. Liu, the breeding requirements for Forest Wolf Pet Beasts may not be stringent, but aren’t their combat capabilities relatively weak? Moreover, they seem to require overly specific battlefields. If they’re not fighting in a forest, both their offensive power and mobility are too frail.\"\nA young man with sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes spoke up, clearly unconvinced by Old Liu’s recommendation of the Forest Wolf as a Cultivation Body.\nLiu Fuhai’s expression stiffened. If this were his own disciple or a Breeder from Jianghai Province, he would have already scolded him. But alas, this young man was from Huaiyang Province, and his backer was Liu Fuhai’s equal.\n\"The purpose of Pet Beast breeding is to turn the impossible into the possible. If there were invincible, all-powerful Pet Beasts, then what would be the need for Breeders and Beast Tamers? Alright, I’ve got some business to take care of. Xiao Sun, please accompany them for a tour around the Wolf Garden.\"\nVice President Liu’s expression wasn’t very pleasant.\nThese cheeky kids, don’t they know respect for their superiors at all?\nIt was at that moment that Vice President Liu’s phone rang again.\nA message came in.\n[Qin Erlong: You owe me a big favor, old man!]\nLiu Fuhai was startled and raised an eyebrow. \"What favor?\"\n\"Heh, you’ll find out soon enough...\"\nLiu Fuhai felt his blood pressure surge, his face reddening. Reading the message from Qin Erlong, he swore out loud, \"You know my ass!\"\nLately, he hadn’t encountered a single good thing or sane person.\nThe experimental project for the Super-Rank Skill combination of the Snow Wolf’s Evolutionary Body, the Icefang Whitewolf, had been declared a failure, indicating another mistake in his research direction and two years of effort gone down the drain.\nThen there was that riddler, Zhao Deguang. And now this again?\nWill it never end!? Does he think I have no temper?\nHowever, when he sent another message, there was no response from the other side.\nObviously, Qin Erlong didn’t realize that a careless comment had irked his old friend so badly that every Breeder and Beast Tamer who sought him out that day suffered his foul mood, Sun Chaoju included.\nOf course, even if Qin Erlong knew, it wouldn’t bother him. His gaze was firmly fixed on the screen.\nAt this moment, he finally relaxed.\nThis is outrageous!\nIn just a matter of hours, the same scenario—encountering Commander Level Sword Devices and groups of Sword Pet Beasts—had happened three times!\nThere was even an instance where they directly faced two Commanders!\nBut in the end, whether facing a Commander or the rest of the Rotten Sword Pet Beasts, Su Ping’s combat group had achieved a terrifying miracle:\nZero casualties!\nNot a single Forest Wolf had died or even been severely injured!\nThe entire wolf pack demonstrated terrifyingly effective cooperation.\nWhenever a Forest Wolf was injured, it would immediately trigger the effects of Heart of Woods, drawing Life Force from the surrounding trees to rapidly heal its wounds.\nWhat was more bizarre was that the trees seemed to provide an inexhaustible supply of Life Force.\nThe Wanmu Wolf, resembling a Kylin, appeared to never run out of Energy, as if it would never weaken!\nThat was the main reason!\nQin Erlong could see that, but even he didn’t know how it was possible.\nAfter all, the Wanmu Wolf’s Cultivation was Su Ping’s creation.\nWhatever Skills it had, Qin Erlong had no idea.\nAll he knew was that this Evolutionary Body appeared to be truly extraordinary!\nHowever, if Qin Erlong had paid closer attention, he might have noticed that the sunlight in the sky seemed a bit dimmer than when they first arrived.\nSu Ping indeed knew. In fact, as he orderly marched his wolf pack towards the highest peak, he was no longer worried about whether he could reach the summit.\nWild Pet Beasts, compared to those of Beast Tamers, have a certain gap, especially since I acquired Mind Vision and can direct them more swiftly. Plus, with Da Zhuang staying close by my side, I won’t be decapitated.\nThis, coupled with Old Sha’s Skills.\nThis was the advantage of the Forest Wolf pack combined with Heart of Woods in forest warfare! Forest Torrent! Although it’s far from reaching that level, there’s no doubt that with the final puzzle piece of ’Mind Vision,’ my concept has begun to take shape.\nBut now, Su Ping wasn’t concerned about these things. He was pondering a question.\nBecause even I feel it’s somewhat against the natural order! A bit monstrous! It’s nothing else but this: under the effect of Old Sha’s Ability, that seemingly endless supply of power for replenishment! It’s based on the theoretical formula I established: X=Y=Z=X2=Y2=Z2. This formula is based on the combination of Sunlight Absorption, Photosynthesis, and Heart of Woods! Sunlight Absorption to draw in sunlight, Photosynthesis to break down sunlight, and Heart of Woods to utilize sunlight! As long as there’s sunlight, Old Sha’s power can be called endless. And even then, Old Sha’s Heart of Woods is only at the Mastery Level. There are still some flaws in its utilization of sunlight; otherwise, it would be even more exaggerated!\nFrom this perspective, the practice of Skill Levels is one aspect. Simultaneously, the correct combination of Skills is needed to bring out more outstanding effects. If the Skills are mismatched, aside from wasting Energy, one can only achieve effects reminiscent of a hodgepodge performance.\nCollecting his thoughts, Su Ping didn’t dwell on this further. He now just wanted to wait and see when Old Sha would cultivate Heart of Woods to the Perfection Level and if more chemical reactions would occur then.\nBesides, now was not the time to ponder these matters. After a journey of several hours, overcoming the mountains filled with countless Sword Devices of the Sword Tomb, Su Ping finally arrived at the towering summit!\nHowever, what Su Ping hadn’t anticipated was that he had assumed there would be many enemies atop this highest peak, no matter what.\nAfter all, in any adventure, the place closest to the end is always where the biggest boss resides.\nYet, upon reaching this mountain peak, Su Ping encountered not the slightest resistance. All he found was debris scattered everywhere.\nAtop this tallest summit, it looked like it had been bombarded. Those broken long swords were even reduced to scrap metal, and the hard ground was filled with large craters.\nClearly, an unimaginable battle had taken place here before.\nAnd within this Mysterious Realm Space, aside from Su Ping, there could only be one other person!\nUnhindered, Su Ping called back Da Zhuang, who had been scouting ahead, and the five Forest Wolves to rejoin the wolf pack, then he accelerated.\nSure enough, atop the highest peak within this Secret Realm, he saw that figure.\nAfter several hours, Dong Muyun bore no trace of dirt or signs of battle on her.\nHer form-fitted battle armor still looked noble and lavish, yet Dong Muyun’s face was filled with nothing but irritation at that moment.\nSu Ping finally saw clearly that on the flat peak stood an immensely large long sword.\nThe black sword seemed to have fallen from the sky, embedded into the mountain peak. The sword body and hilt that emerged, a full tens of meters high, looked as though they were only a part of it.\nSo, this is the so-called place of Sword Inheritance?\nSu Ping looked up, gazing at the huge long sword and then at Dong Muyun, who stood close by.\nDong Muyun, having heard Su Ping approaching, turned her head and was slightly taken aback.\nBehind him, the wolf pack surrounding Su Ping did not present the disheveled scenario she had imagined. Instead, Su Ping’s composure was far beyond her expectations.\nInstantly, Dong Muyun’s gaze locked onto the peculiar wolf.\nWhat kind of Pet Beast is this?\nDong Muyun raised her eyebrows, her eyes showing a trace of astonishment, but she did not ask anything.\nThe Pet Beast Evolutionary Bodies in this world are countless; it’s impossible to know them all. After all, Qin Erlong was still outside. Perhaps he had helped Su Ping bring this Pet Beast in for protection.\n\"What are you doing here?\" Dong Muyun’s brows furrowed, clearly indicating that she was not in the best of moods.\nThis Secret Realm was more barren than she had imagined.\nNormally, even a Secret Realm left by an Emperor-level Beastmaster would not be so barren.\nYet, in this godforsaken place, apart from the remains gained from slaying those Pet Beasts, she found nothing else.\nShe didn’t even find the remnants of ores that should be present!\nAbsurd!\nAt that moment, Dong Muyun realized that she had to find the so-called Sword Soul Mark. But what was the Sword Soul Mark? A Pet Beast? An item? Or some vague, intangible thing? She had killed many Pet Beasts, observed them carefully, but found nothing unusual, nor the so-called Sword Soul Mark! The problem was, she only had twenty-four hours, and if the twenty-four-hour exploration period ended, she would have to leave.\nTherefore, Dong Muyun went directly to the highest peak, wanting to see what was intriguing about this so-called Sword Inheritance.\nFortunately, although her strength and that of her Pet Beasts were suppressed in this Secret Realm, they were still overwhelmingly powerful against those beings.\nBut the result, clearly, did not satisfy Dong Muyun.\nLooking at Dong Muyun’s restless demeanor, Su Ping evidently understood her thoughts at that moment.\nHowever, he did not provoke Dong Muyun.\nAfter all, there’s no need to show off after reaping the benefits; quietly making a fortune is the right thing to do. Otherwise, what if I push Dong Muyun into desperation and she refuses to give me the Mechanical Core?\nPaying no heed to Dong Muyun squatting not far from the giant sword, Su Ping left the wolf pack behind and approached the massive sword slowly.\nDong Muyun raised her eyebrows, a hint of mockery in her eyes.\nShe had also attempted to touch this giant sword, yet her end result was being blown away by the immense power of the sword, although without injury.\nPerfect opportunity for this youngster to make a fool of himself!\nHowever, just when Dong Muyun was gleefully anticipating, a light flashed, and a confused little Paperman appeared in her line of sight.\nIt also appeared before Qin Erlong, who had been watching from the outside all along.\nThen, under Su Ping’s command, the little Paperman activated the Sword Soul Mark!\nThe next moment, a sword light shot to the sky.\nIt lit up Dong Muyun’s dumbfounded pupils.\nWhat was that?",

      "content": "Chapter 128: Chapter 112: The Soul of the Sword! Such a legacy, I don’t want it!\nThe sword light that soared into the sky enveloped both the little Paperman and the equally baffled Su Ping.\nSu Ping had not expected the commotion caused by this Sword Inheritance to be so huge. It seemed that it made no difference whether he avoided Dong Muyun or not. Since that was the case, Su Ping simply chose to ignore the murderous gaze from Dong Muyun behind him, who seemed to have come to a realization.\nAfter all, I myself hadn’t anticipated that the predecessor who set up the inheritance would do so thoroughly. Could there really be no other resources in this Secret Realm?\nFortunately, the emergence of the sword light also attracted Dong Muyun.\nWhat Su Ping imagined, that the inheritance would take him to another place, did not happen.\nClearly, he had overestimated the grandeur of this so-called Sword Inheritance.\nWithin his view, the sword light gradually faded, and a shadowy Sword Spirit slowly emerged from the top of the giant sword that pierced the sky.\n\"The legacy of my master has finally been activated. Young man, congratulations!\"\nThe aged voice, along with the ethereal body and the words spoken, clearly revealed the identity of the figure.\nSu Ping couldn’t help but feel a trickle of excitement and asked, \"I’ve met you, Senior. May I ask who you are...?\"\n\"I am one of my master’s Pet Beasts, and also the last wisp of Sword Spirit my master left in this Secret Realm! My master is the Fengdu Sword King, the general who guarded the northwest border of the Liang Dynasty!\"\n\"Sword King?!\"\nSu Ping was slightly stunned. It seemed that this place was indeed the Heritage Secret Realm of an Emperor-level Beastmaster.\nSu Ping felt a tinge of regret.\nIt was a pity that it was only Emperor Level.\nSeemingly detecting Su Ping’s feeling of regret, the figure appeared slightly dissatisfied. \"Young man, although my master was a King Level Beast Tamer, he was once touted as the most likely to become a Sword Saint and even slew a Saint Level Ferocious Beast.\"\nAt this revelation, Su Ping promptly showed an astonished expression and said, \"I see, I was presumptuous...\"\nAfter all, he was about to receive a benefit from someone else; he should maintain the respect due.\n\"Fengdu Sword King?\"\nThis voice was not only heard by Su Ping but also by Dong Muyun and Qin Erlong at this moment.\nThe former obviously shared the same lack of historical knowledge as Su Ping. The latter, after thinking for a moment, recalled a name and said, \"The Fengdu Sword King, Yu Liangqing, from several hundred years ago during the Liang Dynasty? The peak Sword King renowned for slaying ghosts and gods with a single sword? Indeed, he once killed a Spirit Saint Level Luo Life Ghost Mother. That would qualify him as a powerful peak Emperor-level Beastmaster. It’s unexpected that this Secret Realm is his Land of Inheritance.\"\nQin Erlong clicked his tongue and then grinned, saying, \"Tsk, this is rather shabby. An entire Secret Realm without a single resource or even the seeds for resources to be born? Could it be that the Fengdu Sword King had his assets seized by the Emperor of the Liang Dynasty before he died?\"\nClearly, Qin Erlong wasn’t the only one harboring this thought; Dong Muyun felt the same. However, they would soon understand why this was.\nIt seemed that Su Ping’s earlier attitude had slightly displeased this remnant soul. He no longer indulged in small talk but instead fulfilled his duty and directly conveyed the master’s final wishes, saying, \"Well then, my master was devoted to the arts of the sword and necromancy in his lifetime. His ace Pet Beasts were the Two-stage Evolution cultivation created by his unique method: the General Level peak Immortal White Bone Sword, and its corresponding King Level Evolutionary Body, the Extinguishing Spirit Yama Sword!\"\nGoodness, those names sound quite imposing!\nSu Ping also showed an expectant look.\nAlthough he wasn’t currently interested in Instrument Type Pet Beasts, the chance to freely obtain an Emperor Level cultivation method was quite nice.\nUnfortunately, the voice then said, \"However, this secret cultivation method has already been offered to the Glazed Saint Master, and my master promised not to pass it on any further. Naturally, I cannot bestow it upon you either.\"\nA streak of annoyance crossed Su Ping’s forehead.\nIf it wasn’t to be passed on, why the long-winded explanation?\n\"Nevertheless, my master had a new idea after we failed in our attempt to ascend to the Saint Realm, knowing the path to Holy Master was out of reach. That was to integrate the Sword Type with the way of the undead, attempting to create a new Pet Beast! And this is the only legacy my master has left!\"\n\"Oh?!\"\nSu Ping was taken aback and instinctively glanced at the little Paperman.\nSo the little Paperman was the special Pet Beast this master had created? It really seemed so, as the little Paperman was indeed a combination of the Metal Element and the Necromancy Series.\n\"Then I have already received it!\" he said with a smile.\nHowever, the voice shook its head. \"No! There’s one final step still missing!\"\n\"Hm? What step?\"\nThe voice paused, seemingly also becoming extremely excited, and continued, \"The sword-souled Pet Beast my master wished to create is a purely undead sword! That is the true Pet Beast: ’Sword Soul’!\n\"Therefore, before dying, my master purchased two main material resources and several auxiliary resources, using the last of his time to create it!\n\"These two resources are the Saint Level ’Soul Seed’ and the Saint Level ’Sword Intent Origin’!\"\nSu Ping’s pupils shrank slightly.\nEven Dong Muyun, who was not far away, inhaled sharply.\nSuch extravagance!\nThe higher the Level of the resource, the more unimaginable its value.\nEmperor Level resources were already unimaginably Advanced Level resources. And as for Spirit Saint Level ones... Needless to say, ordinary people probably hadn’t even heard the names of most Spiritual Level Resources, including Su Ping.\nFortunately, the figure went on to explain what these two resources that had reached such a level were for.",

I Don’t Want Such a Legacy!_2\n\"Soul Seed, a Necromancy System Spiritual Level Resource, can be used on the corpse of any powerful Pet Beast, allowing it to resurrect as an Undead Pet Beast! Even if a Spirit Saint Level Pet Beast dies, it can still be resurrected! And its Level and strength will not change significantly.\"\nWhat the—?!\nSu Ping gasped.\nA Spiritual Level Resource was indeed outrageous.\nIf there were countless Soul Seeds, by slaughtering Spirit Saint Level Pet Beasts, wouldn’t it be possible to rapidly gather an unimaginable army of Spirit Saint Level Undead Pet Beasts?\nIf that were the case, it would truly be terrifying.\nHowever, he could imagine that such a thing wouldn’t be easy to obtain.\nSeemingly satisfied with Su Ping’s shock, the voice continued, \"And the Sword Intent Origin can be applied to sword-type Pet Beasts. Not only would it significantly enhance the sword-type Pet Beast’s comprehension of any sword-related Skills, but it would also allow the sword-type Pet Beast to comprehend the Super-Rank sword-type Pet Beast exclusive Skill: Sword Intent, after reaching the peak of the General Level!\"\nGeneral Level was the term used during the Liang Dynasty era, which translates to Commander Level today.\nSu Ping blinked.\nSure enough, once resource treasures reached this level, they started becoming truly outlandish.\nSuper-Rank Skills!\nEven now, Su Ping still did not know just how powerful Super-Rank Skills truly were.\nAnd Vice President Liu had told him that Super-Rank Skills—let alone for those at Peak Command—even Monarchs and Emperors weren’t guaranteed to master them!\nAs for the key aspects, Old Liu had been coy and hadn’t elaborated.\nBut Su Ping could imagine the difficulty involved.\nAnd now, this entity was telling me that a Spiritual Level Resource could enable a sword-type Pet Beast to comprehend a Super-Rank Skill like Sword Intent upon reaching the Commander-Level Peak?\nClearly, Su Ping was already eager.\nSeeming to notice Su Ping’s excitement, the figure laughed with satisfaction and said, \"That’s right. That’s how the Sword Soul was born! It was formed using the purest Saint Level treasure, the ’Soul Seed,’ as its body, and the ’Sword Intent Origin’ saturating its heart, thereby sculpting an unprecedented Sword Soul embryo!\n\"However, a pure soul body cannot be preserved for long. The Master’s lifespan was insufficient to wait for it to find a successor and mature. Therefore, the Master used several auxiliary resources to transfer the condensed soul body into the body of a Rotten Sword.\n\"However, due to the Master’s foresight, Pet Beasts possessing the Sword Soul Mark could only increase in Level. They were unable to truly utilize the Sword Soul’s power; at most, they were influenced so their skill levels increased more quickly!\n\"The Sword Soul Mark, condensed by the Sword Soul, automatically enters the body of the next host upon the current ’host’s’ death. It waits for a successor to arrive. Whoever is capable of obtaining the Sword Soul can contract it to accelerate its growth and power! Clearly, lucky future successor, you are that fortunate person!\"\nInitially, Su Ping listened with surging excitement.\nWow, so my little Paperman has such an impressive origin!\nNo wonder it’s so special compared to ordinary Papermen.\nIt was actually formed from two Spiritual Level Resource treasures combined!\nBut the more Su Ping listened, the more he felt something was amiss. By the end, he finally realized what was wrong. He first walked over to the little Paperman, allowing it to hide behind him, and then he asked, \"So, the last step you just mentioned is...\"\nThe figure laughed and said, \"That’s right. Extracting the soul formed by the Sword Soul Mark from this host’s body—that is the true Sword Soul!\"\nSu Ping showed no joy or excitement at the prospect of this imminent windfall, instead staring intently at the figure. \"Then, will the extracted Sword Soul still retain the little Paperman’s previous memories and consciousness?\"\nThe figure clearly didn’t notice the particular tone in Su Ping’s words and chuckled, \"Hehe, its possession of this lowly Paperman body is merely due to the consciousness shaped by the Paperman itself and influenced by the Sword Soul Mark. Once the Sword Soul is stripped away, the insignificant intelligence born from this inferior paper body will naturally vanish.\n\"However, as the Sword Soul’s Level increases, it will also develop new wisdom. This initial lack of intelligence won’t affect its combat capabilities.\"\nSeemingly noticing something from Su Ping’s expression, the figure continued, \"Of course, I can tell that the insignificant Paperman with the Sword Soul Mark is your Contracted Beast. But rest assured, the essence of the extracted Sword Soul is identical to the Paperman’s Soul origin.\n\"The connection through your Soul Contract, at the soul level, will not be affected by the death and destruction of this inferior paper body. It will simply transform your Contracted Beast from this lucky Paperman that happened to obtain the Sword Soul Mark into the true Sword Soul!\"\nDong Muyun glanced at Su Ping. By now, she knew.\nThis little brat agreed to my partnership with ill intentions; turns out he’d already obtained the Sword Soul Mark a long time ago!\nHowever, at this moment, Dong Muyun wasn’t in the mood for resentment or plotting. Instead, she was quite intrigued.\nShe could tell that Su Ping definitely had strong feelings for that little Paperman.\nBut at this moment, how will Su Ping choose?\nDong Muyun asked herself.\nIf it were me, I’m afraid I truly wouldn’t be able to resist such a temptation!\nA new Pet Beast, created from two Spiritual Level Resources!",

I will not erase the little paperman’s spiritual intelligence in exchange for that so-called Sword Soul.\"\nWith a thought, Su Ping recalled the little paperman—still bewildered and clueless about what was happening—directly into his Beast Taming Space.\nThe figure was astounded. It seemed to have never anticipated such an answer; even its remnant soul was stunned, frozen in place.\nTen seconds later, it slowly asked, \"Young man, do you know what you are saying?\"\nSu Ping gave a bitter smile. \"Sorry, Senior. If I get the chance, I will gather ’Soul Seed,’ ’Sword Intent Origin,’ and the other materials. Then, if possible, I will follow the Fengdu Sword King’s idea to recreate a Sword Soul and cultivate it as compensation...\"\nBefore he could finish, the voice turned extremely furious and sharp, accompanied by the clang of a sword. \"Ignorant junior! A mere elite Beast Tamer, daring to speak so boldly? Can you afford to compensate!?\"\nSu Ping’s spirit felt as if scraped by a knife, and he was violently thrown backward.\nAt that moment, Su Ping recalled all the little moments he had spent with the little paperman over the past month.\nIt wasn’t that the two Spiritual Level Resources that formed the Sword Soul weren’t tempting; it was that just the night before, under the little paperman’s excited gaze, he had promised to become its ’master’ and help it grow stronger!\nHow could he go back on his word so quickly!\n\"AWOO!\" With Old Sha’s roar, the wolf pack instantly surrounded Su Ping. The terrifying greatsword was immediately ensnared by numerous branches.\nHowever, those previously all-conquering branches instantly shattered at the figure’s roar!\nA terrifying Sword Qi shot directly towards Su Ping!\nSu Ping, almost without thinking, crushed the special button Qin Erlong had given him.\nThe next moment, an electromagnetic shield flickering with lightning blocked the terrifying sword blade slashing down at him.\nThe terrifying Emperor Level power erupted, creating a massive crack in the entire Secret Realm!\nSu Ping had no time to worry about this. He activated his Pet Beast Home Talent, and the entire wolf pack was recalled into the Beast Taming Space.\nThen, holding Old Sha, with Da Zhuang and Er Zhuang beside him, he vanished from the fracturing space.\nDong Muyun, who had been silent all along, now wore an extremely complicated expression.\nShe hadn’t expected Su Ping to make such a choice.\nTo give up a Sword Soul with limitless potential for a little paperman? And almost at the cost of his own life?\nShe wasn’t particularly surprised that Qin Erlong had given Su Ping such a life-saving item.\nDong Muyun glanced at the lingering residual electromagnetic force and the slowly crumbling Mysterious Realm Space.\nAs the Mysterious Realm Space crumbled, the power within her, previously suppressed by the rules, slowly returned.\nThis Secret Realm was clearly on the brink of annihilation.\nAt this moment, the ephemeral figure turned its gaze towards her. \"Woman from the future,\" it said, \"swiftly go and slay that low-level human. Seize the Sword Soul. My master’s inheritance can also be yours—not just the Sword Soul, but also the method to forge it, along with some of my master’s Cultivation insights...\"\nDong Muyun glanced at the entity and scoffed. \"Who are you commanding? A mere Emperor-level Beast Tamer’s Pet Beast! Although my Dong Family has declined, we were once the Mirror Saint Family. I, Dong Muyun, am the legitimate eldest daughter of the Dong Family. A Secret Realm’s spirit on the verge of collapse, and you’re still trying to put on airs?\"\n\"You...\"\nBefore the voice could finish, Dong Muyun laughed. \"Enough. Hand it over quickly. As the Fengdu Sword King’s Pet Beast, your duty is to ensure the Sword King’s legacy is passed on, not to be swayed by personal feelings!\"\nEvidently, upon hearing these words, the figure on the greatsword within the crumbling Secret Realm finally fell silent. Then, a small, sword-shaped necklace pendant flew into Dong Muyun’s hands.",

Instead, he smiled.\nThis is what a Beast Tamer should be like!\nIf a Beast Tamer, lured by power and resources, can betray even his own Pet Beast, then what else isn’t he capable of betraying?\nSuch a Beast Tamer, even if he has great talent, who would truly dare to trust and bet on him?\nAt this moment, Qin Erlong truly appreciated this young fellow for reasons beyond his talent and his granddaughter’s connection to him.\nBANG!\nSpace shattered.\nAlmost in the next moment, Su Ping, who had disappeared from the UFO’s image, appeared next to Qin Erlong.\nSu Ping’s body still bore some scratches, caused by the recent aftermath and when he was first sent flying.\nQin Erlong sat on a stool, his eyes crinkling with a smile as he looked at the extremely disheveled Su Ping,\n\"Tsk tsk, seems like your confidence has run into some problems!\"\nSu Ping managed a wry smile. He really hadn’t expected this outcome.\nAnd that Spirit of the Secret Realm, why couldn’t it just talk things out? Why resort to aggression like that?\nHe hurriedly got up and bowed respectfully to Qin Erlong,\n\"I was careless. Thank you for saving my life, Old Qin.\"\n\"Even if you refuse, you could be a little more tactful. Why be so blunt?\" Qin Erlong continued with a smile.\nSu Ping was taken aback,\n\"Old Qin, you saw that?\"\nQin Erlong nodded.\nSu Ping grinned and, with a thought, the somewhat bewildered Paperman Qian Yi reappeared.\nIt seemed a bit confused as to why its master had returned from its ’home’ again.\nSu Ping knocked on the Paperman’s head with his finger,\n\"If I’m not straightforward about it, I’m afraid this little guy will be heartbroken when he finds out later.\"\nQin Erlong’s amiable expression faltered as he looked at the peculiar Swordsman Paperman, then he smiled slightly,\n\"Interesting. Rather than that so-called Soul of the Sword, I’m more interested in whether you can raise a Paperman the likes of which no one has ever seen.\"\nSu Ping’s smile grew even wider,\n\"I’ll do my best. As long as Old Qin doesn’t think I’m being foolish.\"\nQin Erlong nodded,\n\"So you know you’re being foolish, huh? But, although it’s foolish, it’s quite remarkable.\"\nSu Ping didn’t respond. He didn’t think much of it.\nIn the next second, Dong Muyun’s figure also appeared not far away.\nAt the same time, the vortex gate of the Secret Realm showed a series of fractured ripples.\nSu Ping’s heart tightened.\nDong Muyun’s narrow eyes narrowed slightly as they focused on Su Ping,\n\"No wonder you wanted to cooperate with me. So, this was your plan all along, huh?\"\nSu Ping gave a dry laugh. Having his scheme exposed by the person involved was indeed a bit awkward.\nSu Ping pretended not to hear and quickly patted Old Sha’s head,\n\"Old Sha, take the little ones back to rest first.\"\nOld Sha nodded. He too was extremely tired. It was clear that even the formidable Skills formula of Sunlight Absorption couldn’t turn him into a true perpetual motion machine. Energy might be infinite under the Sun, but his body and mind would still be affected.\nThe wolf pack was released, including Xiao Qing, but her gaze was a bit resentful since she hadn’t really joined in the wolf pack’s battle this time.\nAfter all, a Metal Element Sword-type Pet Beast, like those of the Earth Element, was known as the most effective counter to Poison Type Pet Beasts.\nQin Erlong quickly helped shift the conversation,\n\"Su Ping, when did you cultivate this Wanmu Wolf? A brand new Forest Wolf Evolver! I guess Old Liu would be ecstatic if he knew.\"\nHuh?!\nThis time, it was Dong Muyun’s turn to be surprised. Of course, she had noticed that peculiar, Kylin-like Forest Wolf Evolver. However, she truly hadn’t imagined it had evolved from a Forest Wolf.\nBut Wanmu Wolf? I’ve never heard of it!\nSu Ping ignored Dong Muyun’s suspicious gaze,\n\"I completed it a few days ago; I was just lucky. But as a brand new Forest Wolf Evolver, the Wanmu Wolf’s performance is definitely up to par!\"\nA brand new Forest Wolf Evolver?!\nWhat the...?\nNow Dong Muyun was truly shocked. At this moment, she finally began to understand why Miss Qin, who was born destined for the clouds, would fall for such a smelly kid a few years her junior.\nForget Qin Xiaoxue; she figured if she were a few years younger, she definitely wouldn’t have been able to resist him either.\nOf course, it seemed it wasn’t too late even now?\nWhat level of high-potential stock was this?!\nTo think he could develop an advanced Forest Wolf Evolver at such a young age! And such a formidable one at that!\nDong Muyun pursed her lips, suddenly made up her mind, and a sword-shaped pendant appeared in her hand. She looked at Su Ping,\n\"Su Ping, I saw what happened just now. The inheritance of that Soul of the Sword is of no use to me, and Tianyun Group has no plans to develop Sword-type Pet Beasts. So, this inheritance from the Fengdu Sword King, I’ll give it back to you.\"",

Absolutely not!\nQin Erlong made up his mind.\nThis brat might be as thick as a log, but I can’t just let my granddaughter’s situation be ignored. I have to take the initiative! Otherwise, such a prime candidate for a grandson-in-law might get snatched away!\nSeeing Su Ping standing there in a daze, Dong Muyun chuckled, \"However, as per our previous agreement, the exploration of the Secret Realm this time was supposed to last twenty-four hours. With the Secret Realm now collapsing, we naturally can’t explore. According to the contract, if the exploration duration isn’t met, we reduce the corresponding reward proportionally!\"\nAt this point, looking at Su Ping’s helpless and resentful expression, Dong Muyun shrugged her shoulders. \"So, according to the rules, the Mechanical Core is gone. You can have the Yuntian Resort for these few hours.\"\nWith the issue of the Secret Realm resolved and her curiosity satisfied, Dong Muyun had no reason to continue. Whether dismantling or moving those instruments and buildings, their value would decrease—it was a matter of going with the flow.\nNo! My Mechanical Core!\nSu Ping wailed inwardly, but his face remained expressionless.\nAfter all, this was clearly stated in the contract. Moreover, he had just taken a significant advantage of her. If Dong Muyun were to be blunt about it, she had truly gained nothing from this trip to the Secret Realm.\nSu Ping glanced at Dong Muyun and said very seriously, \"Regardless, I owe you a favor!\"\nHaving gotten the response she wanted, Dong Muyun’s face blossomed with a springtime smile. She waved her hand and soared into the sky, which was now tinted with twilight.\nQin Erlong warily watched the woman’s retreating figure. She wasn’t much inferior to his own granddaughter in looks, and her status and background weren’t bad either. Most importantly, she had the advantage of proximity, while his granddaughter was far away in the Magic Capital. This situation seemed very dangerous to him.\nSo, Qin Erlong turned his head to look at Su Ping. \"Su Ping, have you been in touch with Xiao Xue recently?\"\nSu Ping’s face stiffened, and he scratched his head awkwardly. \"I’ve been busy researching the Wanmu Wolf, as you know...\"\n\"It’s alright, it’s alright. I was just asking. You young people should communicate more! Okay, I’ve been here with you all day, so I’ll be going now. Remember, communicate more!\"\nSu Ping helplessly and wryly saw Old Qin off to his car. The president of the Jianghai Province Beast Master Association, even from the car, didn’t forget to remind Su Ping to connect more with Qin Xiaoxue.\nSighing and shaking his head, Su Ping didn’t linger. Instead, he sprinted towards the banks of the Lingxi River at top speed, taking Da Zhuang with him but not calling Old Sha.\nBecause he still had one last thing to do, something he wanted to try.\nThough I’m somewhat uncertain about this!\nAfter breaking through to the Elite Level, the Space Characteristic of Su Ping’s Beast Taming Space that awakened was Space Absorption. This was a unique and rare Space Characteristic, one Su Ping hadn’t even dared to share with others because its effect was just too unusual. Absorbing the Origin of a Secret Realm to enhance his own Beast Taming Space’s abilities... it seemed quite sinister no matter how he looked at it. But to expect Su Ping to restrain himself from trying it out was obviously unrealistic.\nSo, after everyone had left, Su Ping still briskly returned to the banks of the Lingxi River. The shattered space vortex made him somewhat nervous. He could sense that to activate the Space Absorption ability, he had to get dangerously close to the Secret Realm. Moreover, for the ability to activate, the Secret Realm could not contain any Pet Beasts exceeding his own Realm. The activation conditions were quite harsh. Under such circumstances, whether it could even be activated was an unknown.\nSu Ping stretched out his hand, directly touching the weak connection of the spatial ripple. Afterward, he felt an invisible tentacle extend from within his Beast Taming Space, connecting through his hand to the broken world before him. At that moment, his Beast Taming Space was like an entity encountering the most delicious delicacy. It plunged a feeler into this shattered world.\nThe Secret Realm was collapsing. Its original commander-rank Sword Devices had already been cleared out countless times, and any that remained were annihilated by the spatial fragmentation. This was a Secret Realm world on the verge of breaking apart. And Su Ping seized the last thread of opportunity for Space Absorption. This was a Mysterious Realm Space left behind by an Emperor-level Beastmaster. Even though there were no resources left, the world itself was incredibly precious.\nSu Ping felt an extremely special power being infused into his Beast Taming Space. This power made his Beast Taming Space seem like a starving infant, desperately absorbing nutrients. At the original boundaries of his Beast Taming Space, the once-stable area began to ripple again. Then, the space, already a size larger than that of an ordinary Elite Level Beast Tamer, slowly started to extend outward once more.\nHowever, the small, newly expanded section looked somewhat different from the previously lush green terrain. The ground was pitch-black, with a texture somewhere between metal and rock, clearly similar to the conditions inside the Secret Realm.\nBefore Su Ping could carefully perceive it, the expansion of his Beast Taming Space caused his spiritual power, which had surged from his breakthrough two days prior, to ripple once again. Before Su Ping could react, his recently attained Realm directly advanced another step!\nElite Second Rank!\nSu Ping slowly opened his eyes. The vortex door to the shattered Mysterious Realm Space vanished without a trace. The tentacle that had connected to the shattered Secret Realm through his body also disappeared completely.\nIt was as if nothing had happened. However, when Su Ping merged his consciousness into his Beast Taming Space, he saw that his original ’three-bedroom, one-living-room’ space had gained an additional ’0.25 room.’ At the same time, feedback from his Space Characteristics arrived as soon as his consciousness appeared:\n[Space Absorption from Secret Realm: Obtained partial Origin characteristics of the Secret Realm. Insufficient Origin absorbed. No additional enhancement.]\n[Can continue to absorb similar Secret Realms or obtain corresponding resources/treasures to complete this Secret Realm’s Origin as own Space Characteristics.]\nSu Ping’s brows rose slightly. He, of course, hadn’t expected to gain any terrifying enhancement from a single instance of Space Absorption. After all, his own Realm was too low.\nIt’s a pity. If this space hadn’t collapsed, I could have waited a bit, until my Realm was higher, before absorbing it.\nShaking his head, Su Ping wasn’t greedy. He exhaled and returned to his house to examine the inheritance left by the Fengdu Sword King within the sword-shaped pendant’s space. His earlier words hadn’t been mere talk. If he had the capability and opportunity in the future, he would still strive to fulfill the Fengdu Sword King’s last wish and see if he could create the so-called ’Soul of the Sword’ according to the king’s vision.\n「Meanwhile」\nQin Erlong, having returned home, couldn’t hold back any longer. The ’UFO’ Pet Beast had recorded the scene of Su Ping’s ’live broadcast’ within the Secret Realm. After watching it repeatedly, especially the Wanmu Wolf’s outrageous performance, Qin Erlong finally couldn’t resist sending the video to an authority in this field—a prominent figure within his own family.\nThen, not long after, his phone rang.\nSure enough, the voice on the other end of the line wasted no words, getting straight to the point, \"Qin Erlong, where did you wrangle up this wolf from?\"",

Around then, Xiao Xue should be evolving into the Crown Wolf Emperor.\"\nThe call ended, and Qin Erlong smiled faintly.\nAfter some thought, he sent Qin Xiaoxue a message: \"Xiao Xue, how have you been lately...\"\n...\nAutumn arrived. However, Jianghai Province, being a coastal region and somewhat southern, felt none of the cold. In fact, the trees and flowers near the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base were still in full bloom.\nThis was partly due to the season, but even more so because the presence of the Forest Wolves had enhanced the plants’ Life Force.\nPet Beasts were indeed miraculous beings, capable of freely influencing the environment around them.\nThe autumn atmosphere also couldn’t affect the current state of the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base.\nBoth inside and out, it could be described as bustling with activity.\nExternally, Su Ping had taken over the Yuntian Resort business from Dong Muyun.\nHe had the high walls separating the two properties demolished and a connecting passageway constructed.\nThe land deeds for the entirety of Heart of Woods were now completely combined.\nIt wasn’t just the land deeds; Su Ping also took on most of Yun Tian’s remaining staff, excluding a few high-level managers.\nYun Tian’s business was decent. Excluding the initial investments, it could still turn a considerable profit if one only counted labor expenses.\nCombined with Su Ping’s own Pet Beast Cultivation enterprise, it almost seemed like a powerful alliance was forming.\nHowever, Su Ping still preferred his peace and quiet. So, even though the two businesses were connected, the Heart of Woods side still saw little personnel traffic.\nThen there was Guan Qianshan.\nLao Guan certainly never expected that in just over half a month, he would once again become the manager of Yuntian Resort.\nNo, that’s not right!\nhe thought.\nIt’s no longer Yuntian Resort, but the Heart of Woods Pet Beast Service Base!\nUndoubtedly, the personnel from Yun Tian greatly alleviated the previous rush of business on Lao Guan’s side. However, as the manager now responsible for the entire Heart of Woods, his job wasn’t much easier than before.\nWhile the external operations of Heart of Woods were bustling, the internal affairs were just as hectic.\n\"Chew! I told you not to just swallow it without thinking, like you’re gobbling down a ginseng fruit!\" Su Ping instructed.\n\"Go and carefully experience the texture of the wood. Feel the sensation as it enters your mouths and stomachs, merging with the changes in your wood nature!\"\n\"You! If you move restlessly again... Old Sha! Prepare to be tied up!\"\n\"AWOO!\"\nThe day after returning from the Secret Realm, Su Ping methodically began the cultivation and evolution process for the Wanmu Wolves. So far, it had progressed smoothly.\nOut of the ten Legion Forest Wolves, a full four had already grasped Photosynthesis, leaving six remaining.\nSu Ping shook his head, instead focusing his attention on Old Sha. It had recovered over the past few days, but Su Ping also knew that the formulas for those three Skills placed a certain strain on both its spirit and body.\nHowever, far from worrying, I actually breathed a genuine sigh of relief,\nSu Ping thought.\nOtherwise, those skill formulas would be too absurdly powerful, so powerful that I’d even worry about potential problems arising. Now, with certain limitations, it all seems relatively more reasonable.\nThe four Forest Wolves that had already mastered Photosynthesis had been ’planted’ in spots outside the forest where sunshine was plentiful, and positioned so they wouldn’t interfere with each other’s sunlight absorption.\nUnfortunately, luck hadn’t been on their side. The weather had been somewhat gloomy recently, with the Sun not making many appearances, which slowed the Photosynthesis cultivation progress for the wolves that had just begun.\nSu Ping wasn’t in a hurry. With the support of the Beast Tamer Legion and ample resources at his disposal, he could provide sunflower seeds and spring water generously.\nHe had, however, gotten his hands on the smiley sunflower seeds. He placed them in the Beast Taming Space but wasn’t in a hurry to plant them. Aside from the Wanmu Wolf cultivation, part of his mental energy was focused on the inheritance of the Fengdu Sword King.\nThis inheritance included not just the Sword Soul, but also many of the Fengdu Sword King’s insights regarding Sword Type Pet Beasts.\nThis had given Su Ping a certain level of in-depth understanding, even though he had never truly come into close contact with these Sword Type Pet Beasts.\nHowever, truth be told, Su Ping’s main focus these past few days had been on investigating one particular matter!\nAfter checking on the Wanmu Wolf cultivation, Su Ping’s phone rang. It was Sun Chaoju, whom he hadn’t seen in quite a while. He quickly answered the call.\n\"Hello? Breeder Sun?\"\n\"Tsk, tsk, you kid. We haven’t been in touch for so long, and now you’re acting so formal?\" Sun Chaoju’s voice came through. \"Just call me Sun Ge.\"\n\"Alright, Sun Ge. Is there something you need?\" Su Ping asked, not rejecting the other’s warmth.\nIt’s like the saying goes,\nSu Ping thought.\nWhen you become strong yourself, you find that most people you meet are good. Sun Chaoju is like that, and so is Dong Muyun.\n\"Last time, didn’t you ask me to help find a skilled Breeder in Linzhou who specializes in Papermen?\" Sun Chaoju continued.\nSu Ping’s heart stirred.\nIndeed, these past few days, his most important task had been searching for information about Papermen.",

Whether for himself or for the little Paperman, he had to find a powerful path to strength for Papermen!\nHowever, Su Ping soon became somewhat speechless.\nSun Chaoju had called, saying, \"I’ve asked around. Forget Linzhou City, even in the entire Jianghai Province, there’s almost no Breeder proficient in Papermen. Let alone an Intermediate Breeder capable of developing Cultivation Skills for them.\"\n\"Oh?\"\nDisappointed, Su Ping knew the other party hadn’t called just to tease him.\nIndeed, that was the case.\n\"However, when the teacher heard it was about you, he gave you something.\" At this point, the scoundrel’s tone paused slightly.\nSu Ping was speechless. He wanted to jump up and give this master-disciple duo, who were just as bad, a blast from an electric cannon. Can’t they speak properly? Why do they love to be so coy!\nBut obviously, since the other party was helping him, he naturally followed the lead and hurriedly asked, \"What is it?\"\n\"Heh heh, it’s a journal from a former Senior Breeder in Jianghai who specialized in research on the Necromancy Series. Of course, it’s not all his notes and insights. However, that predecessor also took an interest in Papermen and recorded some findings.\"\nSu Ping’s eyes lit up. It was perfect timing. The area by the banks of the Lingxi River had been fenced off and barely counted as a new zone. It was time for him to purchase some Papermen.\nTo elevate the Catalog Level of Papermen...\nWhen he reached Elite First Rank, the Forest Wolf Catalog’s sharing ability expanded from twenty people to thirty. Now, at Elite Second Rank, the upper limit had increased by another two, reaching an astounding thirty-two shared connections.\nHe couldn’t wait for the Paperman to gain the same capabilities.\nAfter setting a meeting place with Sun Chaoju, Su Ping, basking in the noon autumn sunshine, sat by the bus window and arrived in Linzhou City Center before dinner.\nGetting off the bus, Su Ping once again thought of the ’Super Shadow’ bike owned by his old man. The mechanical core he was supposed to get from Dong Muyun had also fallen through.\nDamn it, the more he thought about it, the angrier he got.\nThis time, Sun Chaoju didn’t beat around the bush and directly handed the notebook over. He even joined Su Ping for lunch and inquired about the Wanmu Wolf.\nThis time, Su Ping didn’t spill the beans. \"It’s alright, there has been some progress.\"\nDamn it, this master and disciple were better at being coy than anyone. I’ll have to keep a card up my sleeve to give these old guys a big surprise later.\n\"It’s good that there’s progress.\" Upon saying this, Sun Chaoju thought for a moment and added, \"Lately, the teacher hasn’t been in a good mood, so you’d better not go see him. Also, Su Ping, as for researching Papermen, just dabble in it. Consider it a diversion at most, and don’t invest too much into it. Focus mainly on the Wanmu Wolf.\"\nThen, something unexpected happened. Old Sun directly took out three small boxes. These weren’t just any boxes! They were three Sun Crystals!\n\"This is what the teacher asked me to give you. Consider it temporary research funding from the Breeder Association. Let us know if you’re short on any resources. However, the teacher also said that while the instruments are not an option, you can freely use the laboratory.\"\nSo Old Liu was actually putting up serious capital?\nTruth be told, Su Ping was beginning to feel a twinge of guilt.\nIf I keep Old Liu in the dark like this, won’t he get angry later? Considering Old Liu is in a bad mood, it seems I definitely shouldn’t tell him!\nAs for the Papermen, Su Ping clearly understood Sun Chaoju’s intention. However, he didn’t tell him that he had in fact contracted a Paperman as his Pet Beast. For the sake of his own Pet Beast, he had to put more effort into this area.\nNaturally, it wasn’t appropriate to say such things.\nAfter chatting more about Pet Beast cultivation and the Wanmu Wolf at the dinner table, Su Ping headed straight for the market that specialized in selling Undead Pet Beasts. He spent a total of 500,000 and bought ten Papermen of reasonably good quality.\nOnly then, as dusk approached, did he return to the Heart of Woods.\nSu Ping didn’t even rush to release the ten Papermen he had put into the Beast Taming Space. Instead, he went straight to his study and took out the thin notebook.\nClearly, when Sun Chaoju made those comments, he must have been pessimistic about the cultivation of Papermen, and the reason likely lay within this journal. The insights of an Advanced Level Undead Cultivator were indeed worth reading.\nThe notebook belonged to a Breeder named Mu Yu.\nAs he flipped open the cover, he saw the yellowed pages, inscribed with words aged by time:\n\"The essence of Necromancy Series Pet Beasts lies in the condensation of a Pet Beast’s spiritual soul. They can appear as pure souls or with other media. Regardless, any Undead Pet Beast, even those with sturdy bodies like Skeleton Soldiers and Zombies, is fundamentally a soul.\n——Blue Star Undead Breeding Master: Charles Lee\"\n\"I deeply agree and believe that, aside from physical strength, the power of the soul is essential and even more important for most strong Pet Beasts. The fact that some powerful Pet Beasts can transform into an undead form after death is proof, with the most direct examples being Bone Dragons and Phantom Dragons.\"\n\"However, the soul’s condensation apart from the body requires both opportunity and talent. Thus, many Undead Pet Beasts may originate from the soul power of deceased living beings, which, after losing consciousness, coincidentally condense.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 135: Chapter 114: Paperman’s Diary, the Concept of Paper Body Joint!_3\nThe beginning clearly quoted a Breeding Master from an unknown country before directly delving into the main text of this diary manuscript:\n\"The Paperman is the same.\n\"As the weakest of the known Necromancy Series, the soul of a Paperman, after leaving its fragile paper body, cannot coalesce again. It either clings to the remnants of its body or simply dies.\n\"In the world of Breeders, there is a saying: the weaker the Pet Beast, the more infinite its potential; the lower the tier of the Pet Beast, the more diverse its Evolution!\n\"So, why has the Paperman, to this day, only one discovered Evolutionary Body—and it’s the practically unimproved Armor Paperman?\"\nClearly, this Breeder started with such a hypothesis and then embarked on an in-depth study and Cultivation of the Paperman.\nDespite all that had been said previously, this person named Mu Yu didn’t rush into an in-depth study and enhancement of the Paperman’s spirit and soul.\nInstead, he provided evidence concerning the Armor Paperman and the Paperman:\n\"Such an Evolutionary Body is undoubtedly a failure! In an attempt to strengthen the Paperman’s paper body by turning it into ’paper armor,’ they sacrificed the fundamental flexibility of Paper Body Folding—a loss not worth the gain!\"\nMu Yu offered the strongest denial and criticism in his notes!\nSimultaneously, he began efforts to enhance the soul.\nThis was what Mu Yu said, and it was also what he did.\nThe following main text detailed how this Senior Undead Breeder used his experience to enhance the soul of the Paperman:\n\"I believe my findings are correct! Absolutely correct! Master Charles is rightfully recognized by the Blue Star Pet Beast breeding world with the honorary title of ’Undead Crown Breeder.’ His ’Soul Supreme’ theory of the Necromancy Series is the cornerstone of Necromancy Series Cultivation! It’s a universally applicable theoretical foundation!\n\"The strength of the soul is the most important foundation. The most direct and effective method is to use resources from the Necromancy Series. I provided one hundred Papermen with various low-level Cultivation resources, ranging from Ordinary Level to Commander Level, including Soul-Settling Paper, Undead Crystal, Water of Death, Soul Dust, and so on.\"\nDamn, Commander Level is still considered low-level Cultivation resources?\nAnd to start a preliminary Cultivation experiment with one hundred of them?\nAt this moment, Su Ping realized the sheer scale at which such Senior Breeders operated.\nHowever, it seemed that for a Senior Undead Breeder, resources of this level truly weren’t much.\nThe scope of the Necromancy Series was vast, even broader than Liu Fuhai’s Wolf Pet research. One could imagine that this Breeder named Mu Yu was likely no ordinary person.\nNext, the journal recorded the changes in these one hundred Papermen:\n\"After a month of continuous resource enhancement, the experimental subjects’ Realms varied, but all showed significant improvement. However, apart from their Realm, there were no other changes. After they reached the Ordinary Tenth Order, the Undead Crystal no longer had any effect.\n\"But clearly, the Papermen’s soul power had reached the highest point it could be raised to. The essence of Evolution is to find a suitable direction and corresponding methods after reaching this peak, to break through the original limitations.\n\"So, where does the limitation of the Papermen’s souls lie?\n\"Utilizing the Pet Beast Soul Hooker’s ’Soul Extraction’ skill, I directly removed the Papermen’s souls. Through observation, the Papermen’s souls were stagnant, and it was difficult to find any spark of potential in them. Their consciousness and self-awareness were even much weaker than those of other Pet Beasts.\n\"Perhaps if their Realm improves, there will be some changes and differences?\n\"Although I absolutely believe Master Charles’s words, I have to say, perhaps the paper bodies to which the Papermen’s souls are attached are the primary reason for their limitations...\"\nSu Ping smiled.\nThis senior Breeder named Mu Yu was indeed quite interesting.\nInitially, he had disdainfully dismissed the Paperman’s only Evolutionary Body, the ’Armor Paperman.’ He fervently believed that as long as the soul was enhanced, the Paperman would show some evolutionary sparks and new directions for Evolution after its Realm increased.\nHowever, after taking action, he found that enhancing the Paperman’s soul yielded no significant discoveries. Instead, he had to start strengthening the Paperman’s physical body, first continuing to enhance its soul power, and then observing what happened.\nIn truth, no Breeder was a fool. If it were that simple, the Paperman wouldn’t have remained in its current state for so many years.\nHowever, it had to be said that although the diary hadn’t given Su Ping any inspiration so far, it had at least saved him from many potential wrong turns.\nA considerable portion of what followed detailed Breeder Mu’s research, discoveries, and final conclusions in this area:\n\"Damn it! Paper is such an incredibly weak, low-grade material! Why would a soul from the Necromancy Series be born attached to paper? What kind of upper limit or potential could a body made of such material possibly have?!\"\nHe’d lost his composure; he was completely frustrated!\nSu Ping no longer felt the initial anticipation and excitement he had when he started reading the manuscript. Seeing that he was approaching the final few pages, it was clear that the conclusion Breeder Mu had reached meant that this Senior Undead Breeder had truly failed to discover anything useful.",

Impossible! Master Charles had said that Undead Pet Beasts possess infinite possibilities in their mastery of souls!\"\n\"Just because something hasn’t been discovered doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. Often, after all impossibilities have been ruled out, what’s left must be the only possible choice and answer!\"\nWith no mood to critique that Death-grade schoolboy’s famous quote, Su Ping’s brows tightened as he read the following records.\n\"I attempted a soul-devouring experiment.\"\nThe soul-devouring experiment was an experiment involving Undead Pet Beasts that had been classified as taboo and illegal by the Dragon Country Breeding Master Association.\nIt involved the direct devouring of other Pet Beasts’ souls by a Pet Beast.\nSome Pet Beasts could indeed make rapid progress and even undergo unexpected evolutionary changes under these circumstances.\nHowever, the reason this experiment was strictly prohibited was that Undead Pet Beasts that devoured souls could become addicted.\nThis was different from the natural food chain’s cycle of life and death. An Undead Pet Beast that devoured souls might rapidly ascend in Realm for a short time, but it would lose the wisdom and sanity that came with this ascent.\nIt would become a Deadly Beast, addicted to devouring souls and bloodthirsty.\nIn fact, the aforementioned Undead Crystals and Soul Dust were resources related to Necromancy System souls, but they had been specially processed to become safe and harmless.\nHowever, living souls were clearly not.\nA Pet Beast that had lost its wisdom might even defy its master’s orders or turn on them, despite a Soul Contract being in place!\nMoreover, wild experimental Pet Beasts, if not controlled properly and allowed to leave the lab, could pose a great threat and cause significant harm to populated areas.\nThis situation would cause serious instability within the Beast Master Civilization, so it was strictly forbidden.\nAnd at this moment, Mu Yu had clearly violated the ban!\nTo Su Ping, the strength of a Pet Beast was not merely about physical power. Without wisdom, even if a Beast Tamer couldn’t restrain it, no matter how strong, it was just a meaningless wild beast.\nSu Ping’s eyebrows were tightly knitted, but he still turned to the next page.\nHe continued reading, trying to analyze it from another perspective:\n\"The devouring of souls had released a ferocity in the Paperman never seen before! At the same time, one had even easily broken through the limitations of its Racial Potential!\"\n\"That’s right! This is the nature Undead Pet Beasts should have! Those previous Papermen, dull and even incapable of thought, were the ones that were wrong!\"\n\"Could it be that my attempt was correct? My speculation also right? Is the Paperman a rare breed that can only evolve by devouring souls?\"\nClearly, Mu Yu thought he had found a path, but alas, the outcome remained unchanged:\n\"No, no! The Paperman’s Realm had ascended, but its soul still hadn’t surpassed any previous state! Instead, it had become utterly deformed! How could this be? This didn’t conform to Master Charles’s theory of Undead Pet Beast souls!\"\n\"Dead! It died because its soul couldn’t withstand the collapse from consuming another soul! How could this have happened?\"\n\"I’ve got it! Could it be that the Paperman’s soul was inherently incomplete, imperfect! It was a failed Pet Beast Race!\"\n\"No, it shouldn’t even have been called a Pet Beast! It lacked any semblance of the fundamental soul rules necessary for a living being! How could such an inferior creature be considered a complete Pet Beast?\"\n\"To think that such an inferior Pet Beast could have been mixed in with the Necromancy System—it was utterly nonsensical!\"\n\"Damn the disgrace of the Necromancy System.\"\n\"...\"\nThe manuscript, or rather, this special cultivation diary, concluded under Su Ping’s watchful eye.\nThe final words also represented the failure of the man named Mu Yu, a Senior Undead Breeder, and his complete repudiation of the Paperman—a creature dubbed the ’disgrace of the Necromancy System’!\nEven after conducting the soul-devouring experiment, Mu Yu had still failed to incite the slightest change in the Paperman or discover any path to its Evolution.\nAfter all, in the Cultivation of Pet Beasts, the essence of Evolution relied on their innate Racial Skills as Core Techniques. Skills cultivated later in life could hardly serve as a basis for Evolution.\nCould it be that the Paperman is truly a deficient product of the Necromancy System?\nSu Ping’s brows furrowed slightly.\nHe reread it to ensure he hadn’t missed anything, then rested his head on his arms and leaned back, pondering.\nIt seemed that Mu Yu had tried every conceivable method of Evolution for the Paperman that could be imagined through normal channels. It seemed there were no directions left to explore.\nHowever, Su Ping had a certain confidence, largely due to the biggest difference between him and others!\nThe Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas!\nHis consciousness once again entered the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, focusing on the grayish-white entry for the Paperman Record.\nSpeaking of which, the Paperman’s Catalog Level was exceptionally high. It was close to reaching Level 2, due to his occasional contact with the Little Paperman and the massive amount of Experience Points it had accumulated.\nBut at that moment, Su Ping was hardly in the mood to focus on that. Instead, he continued to read the introduction:\n[A special, low-level Undead Pet Beast of the Necromancy System, possessing a frail body and remarkable malleability. It seems to possess quite impressive potential, merely in need of some development! Racial Skills: Paper Body Folding, Paper Body Joint, etc.]\nThe Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas itself acknowledged that the Paperman seemed to possess quite impressive potential.\nHow could this possibly be a deficient Pet Beast?\nA look of determination flashed in Su Ping’s eyes.\nHe slowly shifted his gaze, continuing to look at the list of Racial Skills below, focusing on Paper Body Joint—a Racial Skill Su Ping had never encountered before.\nSu Ping’s brows slowly relaxed.\nPaper Body Joint?\nJoint?\nHis eyes gradually brightened.\nRight or wrong, it wouldn’t hurt to give it a try, would it?\nWith that thought, Su Ping headed to the area he had designated for housing Undead Pet Beasts.",

      "content": "Chapter 137: Chapter 115: Paper Swords! Perfect Paper Body Joint! (Extra for libra the charlatan alliance leader)\nABA ABA...\nIn the midst of the night, within a gloomy underground chamber, an eerie scene unfolded that would likely send any ordinary person running for the hills.\nIn the demolition-style basement, under the dim light, about ten half-meter-tall Papermen emitted a series of unintelligible noises.\nThis was the place designated by the Heart of Woods for Undead Pet Beasts.\nBeast Tamers often avoided Undead Pet Beasts. Unlike creatures like the Forest Wolf, these Pet Beasts weren’t suited for public display. Therefore, an extension was built from the previous house, creating a vast underground chamber to serve as the designated area for Undead Pet Beasts.\nSu Ping sat on the ground, chin propped on his hand, looking at these things, somewhat at a loss for words.\nIndeed, these objects left him somewhat unsure where to begin.\nHe now somewhat understood the frustration and despair Mu Yu had expressed in his manuscript.\nABA ABA...\nNo wonder Mu Yu considered this group of creatures, practically brain-dead, unworthy of being called Pet Beasts.\nSu Ping’s assessment wasn’t an insult; it was simply the unvarnished truth.\nThey found it extremely difficult to understand commands, especially verbal ones.\nThis was especially true without a Soul Contract, as commands could not be issued via that spiritual link, making it even more challenging.\nEven the small Paperman Qian Yi nearby scratched its head, looking puzzled at its somewhat larger ’kin.’\nWhy do these creatures, who look so similar to me, seem a bit dim-witted?\nUnfortunately, even though the small Paperman Qian Yi was more powerful than these low-level Papermen, it was not like Old Sha. Qian Yi lacked the characteristic traits of a Wolf King, so these Papermen, in turn, showed no obedience towards it.\nYet, there was some good news: the Paperman’s entry in the Catalog was at least in an activated state for Su Ping.\nAs such, Su Ping had a natural affinity for Papermen. Provided they weren’t enemies, hadn’t received explicit commands to the contrary, and weren’t actively hostile themselves, these seemingly dim-witted Papermen showed no inclination to attack. They might even display a degree of closeness.\nSu Ping’s idea was actually quite simple. The Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas indicated that the Papermen’s Racial Skills included ’Paper Body Joint.’ True to its name, Su Ping reasoned, he just needed to find a way to join the Papermen together.\nCertainly, this idea was straightforward and one that ordinary people would never consider.\nThis was because this path was derived from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas’s origin analysis of the Paperman’s entry in the Catalog.\nTypically, Racial Skills were abilities that Pet Beasts naturally mastered as they grew.\nBut if Papermen could truly master such skills during growth, they would have probably been discovered long ago.\nTherefore, the Paper Body Joint skill surely had specific conditions and thresholds for mastery.\nUnfortunately, the first stage of this idea was directly thwarted.\nHe couldn’t command these Papermen to transform into the shapes he wanted.\nThat was the crux of the problem.\nMoreover, after racking his brain, he still hadn’t figured out what shapes to transform these Papermen into!\nSu Ping turned his gaze to the small Paperman Qian Yi.\nHis eyes slowly moved to the small Paperman’s waist.\nThere hung a long sword in its scabbard.\nThough, due to the small Paperman’s diminutive size, it was something that, for humans, could at best be considered a dagger.\nSword!\nAfter his experience in the Sword King’s Secret Realm, he was now as familiar with swords as one could be.\nAdditionally, having inherited a portion of the Sword King’s skills and insights, Su Ping also had some ideas regarding swords.\nSo, Su Ping stopped Qian Yi, who was still observing the other Papermen by circling left and right. \"Qian Yi,\" he asked, \"how is your sword crafted?\"\nSwords are typically forged, with a hilt and crossguard added at most. But for the small Paperman Qian Yi, the sword was indeed its own creation.\nQian Yi’s sword, despite being enhanced by the Jinge Technique, frequently needed replacement after its daily practice of hacking at the wall. This meant it had to use Paper Body Folding to create a new one.\n\"WU WA!\" it exclaimed. \"A Swordsman’s sword is naturally the amalgamation of the Swordsman’s life and fervor!\"\n...\nSu Ping said sternly, \"That’s the sword in your heart! What about the sword in your hand?\"\nSurprisingly, after he rephrased the question, the small Paperman finally understood.\nIt drew its ’sword’ from its waist.\nThen, the sword—which had seemed so solid and sharp just moments ago—appeared to soften. Subsequently, it began to transform right before Su Ping’s eyes.\nThe bundle of paper slowly started to weave itself together.\nIt didn’t start from the hilt or the blade. Instead, hardened paper sheets first formed a sturdy ’heart.’ Then, two pieces of paper slowly merged, their junction forming the spine of the sword.\nThe extending portions formed the blade’s edge and tip—exceedingly thin, yet, being made of hardened paper, also incredibly sharp.\nFinally, the crossguard and the hilt took shape.\nSu Ping blinked, a flash of brilliance darting through his mind.\nHe hastily had Qian Yi perform the process again. The steps were the same as before, but this time, Su Ping’s eyes lit up.\nHow many individual parts would be needed to construct a sword out of paper, and how should they be assembled?\nThat sentence from the Breeder’s manuscript flashed through Su Ping’s mind once more!",

      "content": "Chapter 138: Chapter 115: Paper Swords! The Perfected Paper Body Joint! (Extra for Libra the Sage Alliance Master)_2\nThe soul of this Paperman is incomplete! It’s not whole! How can such a Pet Beast be considered a Pet Beast? Therefore, there’s no possibility of evolution from a single Paperman. Forcing evolution would only result in deformed creatures like armored Papermen!\nBut at this moment, the slowly forming mini paper sword seemed to pierce directly through Su Ping’s mind, lighting up a bright spark within his heart. His goosebumps erupted at that instant.\nA Breeder, that’s what the profession is all about! Knowledge, experience, and breeding history might not be as important as a clear direction and a flash of insight on the right path! Of course, at this point for Su Ping, it was more than just a moment of inspiration! It was freaking explosive inspiration, an explosion that left his brain blank. It felt like a current of electricity shooting up from his spine to the crown of his head.\nAnd that spark came from reading Mu Yu’s manuscript and, most importantly, the ’Paper Body Joint’ skill from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas’s racial skills.\nPaper Body Joint! Is it really just the body that’s being jointed? Is it possible that during the Paper Body Folding and Jointing process, the soul also undergoes this so-called jointing?\nInstantly, Su Ping turned his head, his eyes shining with a green glow in the darkness of night. The ones he was staring at were the ten Papermen who were still BABBLING. Clearly, to make these Papermen fulfill his ideas, an essential point was required: to make them listen to him and morph into the form he wanted to see. Before having the idea, it was a difficult task, but with the idea in mind, they had to be transformed, even if by force. Without further ado, he needed to experiment first to see whether his idea was right or wrong. Could Paper Body Jointing really make the Papermen evolve?\nSo, Su Ping decisively grabbed a piece of white paper and a brush and drew a sword. Nothing special, it was just an ordinary longsword. But soon, apart from the longsword itself, he also drew the segmented parts. Here, Su Ping had to once again thank the heritage of the Fengdu Sword King, which allowed Su Ping, who was originally clueless about this, to now have a general understanding. There was also the earlier demonstration by the Little Paperman.\nAfter two hours, Su Ping put down the brush with satisfaction. Apart from the complete form of the longsword, Su Ping had divided the rest into three parts.\nFirst was the Sword Heart, or rather the sword core, which formed the inner core of the paper sword and was also the first thing that Qian Yi had crafted.\nNext was the sword body, the most important part of a sword; only with a sharp blade could it unleash the maximum power of an attack!\nFinally, there were the sword guard and hilt, connected to the sword body. This part required no further explanation.\nSu Ping had spent two hours drawing these three components, so they were naturally extremely detailed, visible from all angles, even down to the specific dimensions and the combination points where the sword body enveloped the sword core. The grooves connecting the sword core to the hilt, as well as the interlocking teeth of the sword body, guard, and hilt, were all meticulously depicted by Su Ping.\nHe didn’t think about those Commander Level Sword Devices he had seen in the Sword King Secret Realm, those with Attribute changes and Skills surpassing Metal Element Sword-type Pet Beasts. You have to eat one bite at a time and walk step by step. First, creating the Paperman’s Paper Body Folding was the most important.\nOnce the basic setup was done, it was time for the components. Immediately, Su Ping’s gaze toward those BABBLING Papermen turned sour. However, Su Ping didn’t rush to take forceful measures but looked at the Little Paperman.\n\"Qian Yi, can you transform into this shape?\" Su Ping pointed at the most central component, the sword core.\nThe Little Paperman scratched its head; it really disliked changing shapes, though it was proficient in the ’face-changing’ technique. However, in response to its master’s demand, it chose to nod. Thus, the Little Paperman, for the first time in front of Su Ping, changed its form. Its paper body slowly softened, and then, as the sheets moved, it transformed into a forty-some-centimeter sword core.\nSu Ping nodded in satisfaction. Then, he turned to one of the Papermen, pulled it over, and had the Paperman, which had witnessed the entire scene, look at Qian Yi, the Little Paperman that had changed into the sword core.\n\"BABBLING...\"\nSu Ping pursed his lips. He was not one to advocate violence, but at this moment, he too wanted to knock some sense into this foolish thing’s head.\nWas his intention not expressed clearly enough?\nFortunately, this creature’s intelligence and self-awareness were indeed not very bright, just as Breeder Mu Yu had written in his diary, but it seemed to grasp the basic idea. Its body slowly softened, and then, astonishingly, within three minutes, Su Ping had modified and reshaped it into sword core components that looked exactly like those of the Little Paperman.\nLucky that he had Little Paperman Qian Yi; otherwise, Su Ping really would have had to start \"folding paper airplanes.\"\n\"Very good! Hold that shape!\"\nSu Ping thought for a moment and set the transformed Paperman aside to avoid interfering with the next change.\n\"Qian Yi, revert for a moment.\"\nImmediately, the Little Paperman returned to its original form. \"WOAH!\"\nThen, under Su Ping’s instruction, it once again transformed into the shape of a sword hilt. Following this example, Su Ping pulled out another Paperman, having it change into the sword hilt as well.\nFinally, after half an hour, the remaining seven Papermen were still over there BABBLING, while Su Ping, looking at the three Papermen transformed into the ’sword core’, ’sword body’, and ’sword hilt’, held his breath deeply.\nNext, it was time to witness the miracle!\nFortunately, the transformed Papermen still maintained their rigid thinking and lack of self-awareness, so they hadn’t moved or changed much during this time. Thus, even when Su Ping picked them up, there was no resistance.\nSu Ping first picked up the central sword core, aligned it with the sword body, and slowly pushed it into place along the joint slots. There was no sound or movement, but at that moment, the two original Papermen seemed to merge into one.\nBut clearly, that was not the end!\nSu Ping exhaled deeply. The Little Paperman watched intently from the side. After all, within the Little Paperman’s body, there was a ’Sword Soul Mark’. Moreover, it was a special life form and consciousness born from a Spiritual Level Resource Soul Seed and the Sword Soul Mark. It had a tremendous talent and curiosity for anything related to swords. Naturally, Su Ping’s actions attracted all of the Little Paperman’s attention. It watched each of Su Ping’s movements meticulously.\nFor some reason, the Little Paperman felt that whatever was about to happen would be greatly related to itself.\nSu Ping, at that moment, could no longer pay attention to the Little Paperman’s gaze. He took the paper sword, which contained the sword body and part of the sword core, and from the bottom groove, finally, slowly joined it with the Paperman transformed into the sword guard and hilt.\nCLICK.\nThe clear sound seemed to turn the gears of the world.\nFinally, the three Papermen, in this manner, became intimately one before Su Ping’s eyes!\nA very simple yet utterly pure, pale paper sword thus appeared before Su Ping and the Little Paperman. An unmistakable, abstract longing emerged in the Little Paperman’s expression.\nBut Su Ping continued to stare intently at the changes on the paper sword. This continued for less than half a minute. Then, in his line of sight, a point of light emerged from this paper sword. The next moment, within the Eye of Truth, the meaning behind this light appeared!\nSu Ping’s pupils suddenly shrank, and then he was overcome with unimaginable ecstasy.\nBecause that was indeed:\n[Paper Body Joint (Beginner)]",

He didn’t rush to revel in this sudden success, but rather intently observed the Paper Sword with the Eye of Truth!\nThis mysterious Paper Body Joint skill couldn’t be something simple.\nAnd indeed, it wasn’t.\nWhat the Eye of Truth showed him about this Paper Sword left Su Ping slightly stunned.\n[Paperman (Wild) (3×1-Paper Sword Form)]\n[Attribute: Undead]\n[Current Level: Ordinary Fourth Stage]\n[Racial Potential: Common Tenth Level]\n[Skills: Paper Body Folding (Beginner), Paper Body Joint (Beginner)]\nThat was all.\nBut this feedback made Su Ping’s eyes narrow slightly once again.\nNormally, even if the assembly was completed, Su Ping’s Eye of Truth should have perceived the Paper Sword as a separate transformation form of the Paperman.\nHowever, the Eye of Truth indicated that the Paperman had become what’s called a ’Paper Sword Form’!\nBecome a so-called ’3×1’ status?\nIn other words, after the Paper Body Joint merged the Papermen into this state of a Paper Sword, the Eye of Truth judged the current Paperman as a single entity—three Pet Beasts that had actually become one.\nSu Ping slowly picked up the sword, and something even more unexpected occurred.\nOn the blade, a very vague cheek appeared.\nIt was the distinctly abstract cheek of the Paperman.\n\"WHIRR...\"\nA meaningless sound emerged, but Su Ping could sense its excitement.\nSu Ping was taken aback once more.\nCompared to the Papermen still standing there, gibbering ’BLAH BLAH’, this one’s ability to express emotion already demonstrated its uniqueness!\nCould it be that his nonsensical guess was true?!\nFollowing the Paper Body Joint, were the souls of the Papermen also merged?\nDid it therefore result in an immense enhancement in the Paperman’s consciousness and self-awareness?\nMarvelous!

The Little Paper Man’s Three Sword Style!_2\nAny small component that required a Paperman to transform and assemble would necessitate Su Ping designing it in its entirety, let alone a gigantic Gundam. Even a humanoid robot would need countless components. Paper Swords, however, were quite simple, only requiring three parts: the sword core, hilt, and blade. That was all there was to it.\nBut for the colossal body of a Gundam, constructed by tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands to millions of Papermen,\nthe components needed for such a massive machine would be difficult to produce even if my brain were cloned ten times, wouldn’t they?\nAfter all, he would have to start designing from the individual components. Besides, Su Ping was not optimistic about the combat performance of paper merging into a human form for battle. On the contrary, using simple transformations to create Paper Swords, as he was doing now, was, in a sense, an easier and more straightforward way to achieve effective results.\nHowever, this was just the beginning.\nIn the future, once I make the abilities of the Paperman public, countless Beast Tamers will perfect it.\nAs for how to further demonstrate the effects and power of this assembly at present, Su Ping almost immediately had an answer:\nMatryoshka dolls and enhancing the ’components’ of the Paperman itself.\nThe former went without saying; Su Ping’s main focus was on enhancing the components. The components themselves were the bodies of the Papermen that had comprehended ’Paper Body Joint.’ This meant that upgrading the power of the Paperman itself, or even allowing a Paperman that had comprehended ’Paper Body Joint’ to evolve, would suffice. It looked simple, but the evolution of the Paperman was the greatest challenge for all Undead Cultivators. As mentioned before, the only known evolutionary form of the Paperman was the deformed Armored Paperman. After becoming an Armored Paperman, it could no longer use Paper Body Folding. Without the ability to fold, it naturally could not be assembled, which indeed made it a useless evolutionary form.\nThinking of this, Su Ping had a plan. It was just as the Advanced Level Undead Beast Tamer Mu Yu had said:\nNo matter what, first increase the Paperman’s soul foundation, then improve its Realm!\nAfter all, in cultivation theory, there were no examples of a basic Pet Beast evolving at a low level. At the very least, evolution could only be accomplished when nearing the race’s Racial Potential limit. With this in mind, Su Ping picked up the Paper Sword, which was less than three feet long. He made a light chopping motion. A clear sword mark appeared on the ground; the bluestone slabs offered no resistance to the Paper Sword.\nSu Ping smiled.\n\"Disassemble!\"\nHe issued the command via Telepathic Communication. If it had been before this, the three Papermen would definitely not have understood what this meant. Their souls were too weak, and their self-awareness was like that of insects from his previous life on Earth, only capable of following racial instincts. But now, after combining, they could somewhat understand the meaning of words spoken via Telepathic Communication!\nImmediately, starting from the blade, the hardened paper body slowly softened without Su Ping having to dismantle it by hand. Like a loose, spread blanket, it fell to the ground. Afterwards, the components reverted to the form of the Papermen. The hilt and the sword core transformed from parts of a Paper Sword back into their original Paperman shapes, a process completed in three breaths!\nABABA ABABA...\nLooking at the three Papermen that had returned to their original forms before him, Su Ping blinked.\nHe once again activated the Eye of Truth:\n[Paperman (Wild) (Basic State)]\n[Attribute: Undead]\n[Current Level: Ordinary Second Rank]\n[Racial Potential: Common Tenth Level]\n[Skills: Paper Body Folding (Beginner), Paper Body Joint (Beginner)]\nIndeed, they had returned to their original state.\nBut before he could think further, the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, which had been quiet for a long time, suddenly began to turn slowly in his mind. Then, the pale Origami Man Record suddenly lit up. Beneath this record, in the log where entries were recorded, a special prompt appeared that had never been associated with Papermen before:\n[Discovery and contact with Paperman, intimacy requirement met, Catalog Level Experience +10*3!]\n[Discovery and cultivation of Paperman’s special Racial Skill: Paper Body Joint, Catalog Level Experience +100 points!]\n[Origami Man Record Experience Points: 617/500! Experience meets Catalog upgrade requirements. Upgrade?]\nEnough experience?\nSu Ping was slightly startled but then smiled. After all, just discovering Qian Yi had already granted 350 experience points. Compared to the 500 points required for the Catalog to advance from LV1 to LV2, this truly wasn’t a big deal.\nYes!\nWith a thought, the Origami Man Record before him reacted just like the Forest Wolf’s had. The pale record itself began to be tinged with green. Soon, this touch of green replaced the previous white of the record, signifying the successful upgrade of the Origami Man Record.\nAt the same time, just as Su Ping had expected, after it was upgraded to LV2, the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas provided him with the most direct feedback in the depths of his mind:\n[Catalog ’Paperman’ level upgraded. Current Catalog Level: 2. Received Origin reward: Connection Sharing (Paperman)]\n[Connection Sharing (Paperman): An ability born from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas. Allows connection and sharing with Papermen recorded in the Catalog that meet intimacy requirements. Connected Papermen share skills training, skill usage, and skill enhancement experience.]",

Thanks to Connection Sharing, he now also had the means for more advanced training. The most direct requirements for Evolution were its own Realm and skill level. And Paper Body Joint was clearly a primary requirement for Evolution.\nWith the effects of the Paperman LV2 Catalog, Su Ping could feel the bond between the three Papermen and himself grow stronger.\nThen, Su Ping thought for a moment and directly used Telepathic Communication to command the three Papermen, \"Merge! Assume Paper Sword Form!\"\nThis time, it wasn’t as complex as before; Su Ping didn’t need to spend nearly as much effort.\nThe three Papermen adeptly began to transform.\nThis time, each transformed into its respective component, then completed the assembly and joining automatically while Floating in the air.\nFrom beginning to end, it took less than five seconds!\nQian Yi, who was watching from the side, observed its kin transforming. It seemed to understand something instantly, blinking its eyes, full of curiosity and eagerness to try.\nSu Ping also glanced at Qian Yi.\nQian Yi was his Pet Beast. Ultimately, the Evolution of the Papermen was primarily intended to serve Qian Yi. This was true for both combat power and experimentation. Therefore, no matter what, the same had to apply to Qian Yi.\nBut what should Qian Yi assemble into? A sword would undoubtedly be best! Because Su Ping hadn’t forgotten that within Qian Yi lay the Sword Soul, born from the combination of the Sword Intent Origin and the Soul Seed. That Sword Soul possessed an incredibly heaven-defying effect. At Peak Command, it would comprehend the Super-Rank Skill: Sword Intent! However, according to the Sword Spirit from that Secret Realm, unless Qian Yi’s body Evolved, it wouldn’t reach that Realm, nor could it fully utilize the Sword Intent Origin. Nevertheless, there was a problem to consider before the joining! Qian Yi was not an ordinary Paperman! It was a mutated Paperman fused with a Sword Soul. If one had to pinpoint the biggest difference between it and all other Papermen... it wasn’t its mutated Skills or Abilities, but the fact that it possessed a soul capable of forming its own consciousness and awareness without needing to be joined! In that case, could Qian Yi still complete the joining?\nA hint of contemplation flashed across Su Ping’s eyes.\nHe suddenly realized, why the heck had the Cultivation of his two Pet Beasts become significantly harder after they underwent special Mutations? But regardless, he had to try it first.\nWith this thought, Su Ping focused his attention and looked towards Qian Yi.\nQian Yi tensed up. \"WAAH!? Is it coming!?\"\n「An hour later.」\nQian Yi emerged from the loosely joined Paper Swords, reverting to its original form.\nThe attempt had failed.\nSu Ping frowned.\nLooking at the Paper Swords formed by Qian Yi and the other two Papermen, Su Ping noted that not only had Qian Yi failed to achieve comprehension and merge into the previous three-in-one Paper Sword state, but even the other two Papermen hadn’t comprehended the Racial Skill, Paper Body Joint.\nIndeed, his suspicions were correct. The biggest difference between Qian Yi and the other Papermen was that, in essence, it possessed a complete soul. And Paper Body Joint wasn’t just the joining of paper bodies; it was also the connection of souls. With such a connection, Qian Yi was like a 4090 graphics card trying to run on an ancient computer—a successful connection was impossible. Even this analogy wasn’t sufficient to describe the disparity between them.\nUnder Su Ping’s watchful gaze, the other seven Papermen responded to his mental command and rejoined into the Paper Sword Form.\nThis fusion wasn’t a fixed state. The initial three Papermen could also be joined with the Papermen that later formed the Paper Swords. There was no obstruction whatsoever. Clearly, as long as the Papermen comprehended the Skill ’Paper Body Joint’ and acquired the ’Paper Sword Form’ within that Skill, they could flawlessly join anytime, anywhere. Ten Papermen, if they wished, could quickly assemble into three Paper Swords.\nBut the joy from this tremendous discovery gradually faded, overshadowed by the new confusion surrounding Qian Yi, which plunged Su Ping into deep thought.\nSu Ping now understood: if possible, he would never choose a Mutated Pet Beast again. He was just making things difficult for himself! It was true that Mutated Pet Beasts, due to their Mutations, had higher potential, a greater ceiling, and even possessed unprecedented, unique Evolutionary Body forms. But damn it, the difficulty was also immense! If it weren’t for his own ’cheats,’ Su Ping truly doubted he could ensure the smooth Evolution of Xiao Qing and Qian Yi! Even now, this problem had him stumped.\nSu Ping was extremely confident about one thing.\nIf this discovery were made public, it would cause a sensation throughout the Dragon Nation. A whole new blue ocean market for Pet Beasts would emerge. The influence it generated might even be greater than that of the Wanmu Wolf! But he wasn’t running a charity, after all!",

      "content": "Chapter 142: Chapter 116: Fusion! 3x1 Form! The Little Paper Man’s Three Sword Style!_4\nThe research into Papermen was all for the enhancement of his own little Paperman, Qian Yi.\nIt was clear that Su Ping’s contemplation had caused Qian Yi some frustration. The little fellow stared longingly at the distant swords, its expression so eager it was almost comical, yet also somewhat exasperating.\n\"Alright, alright, Qian Yi might not be able to become a sword, but we can use swords, right? Paper Sword Number One, merge!\"\nSu Ping cracked a smile. He ultimately couldn’t bear to watch the little Paperman struggle for hours with nothing to show for it. At his command, three Papermen in the air transformed into Paper Swords and slowly approached Qian Yi.\nQian Yi’s spirits perked up instantly. Such a large sword was much more invigorating to wield than the small dagger at its waist!\nInstantly, on the soft ground of the basement, little Paperman Qian Yi let out a cry, grabbed the Paper Sword, and slashed fiercely!\nA golden light shone upon the Paper Sword’s blade. Simultaneously, the Paper Sword in the little Paperman’s hands seemed to become quicker and sharper!\nThe Fengdu Sword King’s Sword Spirit had been right. Bolstered by the Origin Sword Intent, Qian Yi possessed an almost innate control over swords.\nIt could master any sword instantly. If given the opportunity to learn corresponding Sword Technique Skills, its progress would likely be very swift as well.\nHowever, Su Ping couldn’t even find a way to activate the ’Sword Soul Mark’ within Qian Yi to obtain the Super-Rank Skill ’Sword Intent.’ Moreover, the current progress of research and cultivation was stalled because of the little fellow.\n\"WAH! (Slash!)\"\n\"WAH! (Stab!)\"\n\"WAH! (Flick!)\"\n\"...\"\n\"WAH! (This is what being a true Swordsman is all about!)\"\n\"WAH! (A strong person won’t fall due to a setback; they’ll only become stronger!)\"\nThe little Paperman’s excitement and passion seemed endless.\nJust as it had declared, as long as there was time to train, its Swordsmanship practice and the execution of the Jinge Technique would never stop.\nSu Ping rested his chin on his hand, watching Qian Yi practice. As it trained, Qian Yi spoke of Swordsmen, strength, experts, and loneliness, while Su Ping pondered solutions.\nBut suddenly, Su Ping furrowed his brow as he watched the little Paperman practice its swordsmanship on a training dummy.\nIt was a training dummy made of Hundred-Forged Fine Steel that Su Ping had custom-ordered for several hundred thousand. Its only purpose was durability, and clearly, it was worth the cost.\nEven with the Jinge Technique enhancing its blows, the little Paperman could barely leave a mark on it.\nWatching Qian Yi, a peculiar idea seemed to flash through Su Ping’s mind.\nHowever, this idea was vague, and for a moment, Su Ping couldn’t quite grasp its full implications.\nYet, the sight of Qian Yi’s seemingly tireless, perpetual practice made the thoughts and images in Su Ping’s mind grow increasingly clear.\nAnd so, Su Ping abruptly turned his head towards the Papermen still in their original positions and commanded:\n\"Paper Sword Number Two, Paper Sword Number Three, merge!\"\nSWOOSH! SWOOSH!\nThe Paperman components rapidly shifted and combined. Before Su Ping’s very eyes, they transformed anew into two pale Paper Swords.\n\"Qian Yi!\"\nQian Yi’s slashing motion stopped abruptly. Standing only forty centimeters tall and holding a sword of similar size, it looked rather comical. However, Su Ping clearly had no time for such trivialities; the flames of inspiration in his eyes were reigniting.\nI’ve clearly been overthinking this!\nWhat is Qian Yi, really?!\nIt’s the most unique soul born from two Spiritual Level Resources.\nA Sword Soul with tremendous potential! That’s what allowed it to undergo such a mutation.\nBut this transformation is definitely not complete!\nTrying to make Qian Yi merge and combine with these ordinary Papermen, which are considered the shame of the Necromancy System... wasn’t that just me being foolish?!\nWhat Qian Yi should be doing isn’t combining with these Papermen, but rather utilizing them in a more advanced way!\nInstinctively, Su Ping felt his idea align with the combat methods of using a multitude of Papermen!\nThese Papermen were different from his Xiao Qing or the Forest Wolf pack.\nCurrently, although Xiao Qing had undergone a Poison Type mutation and gained the Poison Flower ability, it was trending towards developing a ’Flower Tree Advent,’ based on the ’Tree Advent’ created by the Wanmu Wolf.\nHowever, Xiao Qing’s influence in this process wasn’t indispensable, at least not for now.\nBut Qian Yi was different! Compared to the other Papermen, Qian Yi was irreplaceable!\nAnd now, Su Ping wanted to see if his new idea was correct.\nQian Yi looked up at its master.\nAnd in its master’s hands, two more swords had appeared!\n\"A true Swordsman can wield more swords and face more complex situations and more challenging foes! Qian Yi, do you have the confidence to do this?\"\n\"UWA? (Two swords?)\"\nQian Yi lowered its head, glancing at the sword in its hand.\nIncluding this one, was it supposed to wield three swords simultaneously?\nThe corners of Qian Yi’s mouth curled up:\nQ(`√´Q)\nThe smirking Swordsman Qian Yi murmured softly, a low \"Uwa...\" under its breath, \"Looks like things are finally getting a little challenging...\"\nThen, under Su Ping’s watchful eyes:\nQian Yi’s expression changed—it literally changed.\n’A.’\nOn its cheek, the poker face had surprisingly returned.\nThis little fellow hasn’t forgotten that abstract poker face, has it?\nWhat Su Ping hadn’t expected was that this little fellow had already unknowingly mastered drawing a spade!\nAt this very moment, the little Paperman’s face was precisely that of an Ace of Spades!\nA Swordsman’s poker face, huh?\nSu Ping also narrowed his eyes slightly and involuntarily held his breath. Then, under his gaze...\nThen, before Su Ping could react, Qian Yi directly took the two Paper Swords.\nHowever, the Paper Sword it had been holding fell to the ground.\nEvidently, Qian Yi’s body was too small. It was already a size smaller than a typical Paperman, and the Paper Swords were assembled from three Papermen, making their blades longer than Qian Yi itself.\nHolding two such swords in its small hands simultaneously was out of the question.\nHowever, just as Su Ping was about to suggest taking one Paper Sword back, Qian Yi moved!\nWithout a second thought, it thrust one of the Paper Swords through its own chest!\nThe sword pierced straight through its chest. Then, its tip seemed to dull slightly. It was as if this three-in-one Paper Sword understood Qian Yi’s intent; the part of the blade embedded in its chest fused and secured itself, connecting firmly with the little Paperman’s torso.\nSu Ping blinked. He then saw the pierced part of Qian Yi’s body directly meld with the Paper Sword, as if they had become one entity.\nEvidently, this was a racial advantage of Papermen. Their bodies were made of paper. As long as they could use Paper Body Folding, and provided the paper body wasn’t completely torn apart, what would be a grievous injury for an animal-type Pet Beast wasn’t even considered a wound for a Paperman.\nThis time, Qian Yi had all three swords under its control.\nWielding two large swords, with a third Paper Sword piercing its chest, the little Paperman under the Ace of Spades poker face exuded an entirely different aura!\nEven Su Ping felt a jolt, like an electric current shooting straight to the crown of his head.\nIs this still the same chattering little Paperman I know?\nCLANG!\nA sudden sword chime, seemingly from nowhere, jolted Su Ping, making him instantly focus his gaze on Qian Yi.\nThe next moment, the brilliant edge of the Jinge Technique lit up simultaneously on all three of Qian Yi’s swords.\nAnd this time, when Qian Yi struck the training dummy before it, the sword left a terrifying, deep gash!\nBefore Su Ping could fully register his astonishment, a brilliant light burst forth from Qian Yi’s body!\nIt was the glow of skill enlightenment!",

      "content": "Chapter 143: Chapter 117: Mutation - Paper Body Control! Qian Yi, the union of man and sword!\nThe Ace of Spades on the little Paperman’s face remained impassive, as if such changes still couldn’t affect a swordsman’s heart. It was just like the three Paper Swords it firmly grasped, still and unmoving.\nFor the first time, Su Ping found the Paperman’s poker face rather endearing.\nThe Paperman indeed possessed a natural mastery and an almost instinctive understanding of swordsmanship.\nIn this peculiar stance, wielding swords in both hands, Qian Yi executed a strike by spinning its body. It used the sword piercing through yet fixed by its body, along with the swords in its hands, to form a circular arc—the Three Sword Style.\nAfter delivering this strike, Qian Yi held the pose.\nThe next moment, as if quite satisfied with this strike, it sighed softly with its featureless face, \"UGH... (This sword, feels so lonely...)\"\nSu Ping pursed his lips, forcibly suppressing the urge to quip. He did his best to ignore this private display before using the Eye of Truth to examine Qian Yi.\nIn Su Ping’s eyes, this light was dazzling, brilliant. At the same time, it was so captivating.\nThis signified a momentous change had finally occurred in Qian Yi.\nAs Su Ping watched, Qian Yi’s abilities finally materialized before his Eye of Truth:\n[Mutated Paperman (Contracted)]\n[Attribute: Metal, Undead]\n[Current Level: Common Tenth Level]\n[Racial Potential: Elite First Rank]\n[Skills: Paper Body Folding (Beginner), Jinge Technique (Perfection), Sword Soul Mark (Special), Accelerated Casting (Proficient Level), Mutated·Paper Body Control (Beginner)]\nThe breakthrough of Accelerated Casting to Proficient Level couldn’t divert Su Ping’s attention. Compared to Qian Yi’s next skill, Accelerated Casting seemed so trivial it was hardly worth mentioning.\nBecause this skill was too eye-catching.\n[Mutated·Paper Manipulation (Beginner): A special mutated skill derived from the Paperman’s ’Paper Body Joint’. It enables perfect control over its own paper body, the separation of its paper, and control over Papermen within a certain range or those it has touched! It also allows for special jointing with any Paperman.]\nThe skill description was deceptively simple and unpretentious.\nIt was similar to Xiao Qing’s ’Heart of the Poison Wood,’ which had mutated and evolved from the ’Heart of Woods’.\nIt not only encompassed the ’Paper Body Joint’ skill itself but also possessed an even more incredible control effect.\nIn other words, compared to Xiao Qing’s relationship with the Forest Wolf pack, Qian Yi was now the absolute monarch among the Papermen! It was the true ’head’—the leader.\nHow interesting!\nBreeding Pet Beasts is just too fascinating!\nSu Ping watched Qian Yi with great enthusiasm.\nAt that moment, Qian Yi also seemed to be sensing the power it had comprehended. The Paper Swords in its hands seemed even easier to command at this moment. Any of its intentions, even under such circumstances, could be more thoroughly understood and executed by the Paper Swords it wielded.\nAt this moment, in Qian Yi’s perception, to use the terminology from those martial arts movies it had seen: This was ’Man and Sword as One’!\nThe little Paperman muttered to itself in bewilderment, \"UGH... (Have I become this strong...)\"\nThe next moment, Qian Yi moved. Around the training dummy in the basement, CLINKING and CLANKING sounds rang out. Every strike left a faint sword mark on the dummy.\nSu Ping intently watched Qian Yi’s every move.\nThe mutated Paper Body Control could very well be crucial to Qian Yi’s evolution!\nThat was certain.\nSo, what were the prerequisites for evolution?\nBased on Qian Yi’s current foundation, Su Ping considered several factors: the consolidation of resources from the Metal Element and Necromancy Series, the improvement of its own Realm, and, possibly most importantly, the skill level of this Paper Manipulation.\nSu Ping scratched his head.\nXiao Qing’s Heart of the Poison Wood, when linked with the regular Forest Wolves’ Heart of Woods through the Shared Connection in the Forest Wolf Catalog, experienced an increased skill enhancement speed.\nBut would Qian Yi’s Paper Body Control, if linked with other Papermen’s Paper Body Joint through the Origami Man Record, also experience an increased rate of improvement?\nSu Ping didn’t know, but he was certain that ten Papermen were far from enough! To train Qian Yi’s Paper Body Control quickly, he needed even more Papermen!\nThe only drawback was that the Shared Connection limit was common to both the Forest Wolf Catalog and the Origami Man Record.\nHowever, fortunately, the cultivation of Forest Wolves had recently hit a bottleneck. Most of the initial Forest Wolves’ skills had reached Proficient Level, and some had even broken through to Mastery Level. At such levels, even with the boost from the Shared Connection, advancing to Perfection would not be easy.\nMoreover, it was time for Su Ping’s cultivation focus to shift to the little Papermen.\nThe reason was simple. Although Xiao Qing hadn’t evolved and hadn’t even found a path or direction for evolution, Xiao Qing’s race limit had reached the formidable Third-Rank Commander. It still had a long way to improve.\nBut Qian Yi is already nearing the limit of its race limit. If it doesn’t evolve, it will significantly hinder Su Ping’s growth rate.\nAs he was thinking, a sharp cry erupted before him!\n\"UGH! (Finisher!)\"\nThe Paperman suddenly retreated. Then, the Paper Sword in its hand unexpectedly flew from its grasp, crossing over ten meters like a hidden weapon thrown by a martial arts expert from the movies.\nThe Paper Sword struck the dummy unerringly.\nA crisp, clear STRIKE echoed!\nThen, the tough, refined steel dummy was actually pierced through the throat by that Paper Sword.\nSu Ping pursed his lips.\nHe suddenly felt he might have truly created an extraordinary new Pet Beast.\nThis new Pet Beast might even be more incredible than the ’Sword Soul’ that the Fengdu Sword King had been so fixated on creating.\n「That night.」\nSu Ping slept especially soundly. He actually had another dream.\nPerhaps it was because, after so many days of nurturing the Paperman, such terrifying improvements and progress had finally been made, leading to his thoughts by day becoming dreams by night.\nOr perhaps the impact of the so-called ’finisher’ unleashed by the Paperman had simply been too overwhelming for him.\nThis was despite the Paperman fainting from energy exhaustion immediately after that strike. Simultaneously, the nine Papermen forming the Paper Sword Form went completely limp, unable to maintain the shape any longer.\nYet, Su Ping’s dream remained exceptionally vivid.\nThe style of this dream didn’t match the world he was in; he even dreamed he had transmigrated again.\nBefore him stood an immortal in white robes, floating above the Nine Heavens. Particularly noteworthy was his stance atop a long sword—clearly a Sword Immortal employing a flying sword technique. But what was more terrifying was that with just a few hand seals from this Sword Immortal, a multitude of flying swords shot out from behind him, beheading enemies thousands of miles away as easily as reaching into a bag to grab something.\nUnfortunately, in this scene where the Sword Immortal should have gracefully departed, Su Ping saw that the Sword Immortal didn’t have a human face, but a sinister Ace of Hearts! And it was accompanied by a crisp ’UGH’!\nEven the ’flying swords’ eventually transformed into paper swords.\nBesides these, amidst his heightened mental state, Su Ping also dreamed of other scattered scenes. There was something about a man wielding a pink sword spouting nonsense about ’Bankai.’ And something about a blond-haired, red-eyed man, wreathed in a golden aura, disdainfully uttering words like ’mongrel’ or some other incomprehensible things.\nThere were too many varied images. So, he slept deeply, and his dreams were equally muddled.\n「The next morning.」\nSu Ping sat at the dining table, munching on a steamed bun. Beside him lay the legacy left by the Fengdu Sword King.\nHe had mentally mastered the creation of the Sword Soul, but it was useless for now. Soul Seeds and Sword Intent Origins weren’t easily obtainable either.\nWhat he was currently examining was, in fact, the true core of the Fengdu Sword King’s legacy. To understand it better, Su Ping had even gone online to do some research.\nHe learned about a famous Marquis Level Beast Tamer from the Liang Dynasty, several hundred years ago. The Marquis Level is now known as the Emperor Level. However, in ancient times, the word ’Emperor’ was exclusively used by the supreme ruler and was naturally taboo. It was only in modern times that the Marquis Level was renamed the Emperor Level. Pet Beasts at this tier are emperors among their kind, and Beast Tamers of this rank are considered kings in society, hence ’Emperor Level’.\nThe book he was reading contained some of Yu Liangqing, the Fengdu Sword King’s, unique skill cultivation methods. All were Swordsmanship-related skills applicable to Sword Type Pet Beasts.\nAlthough he couldn’t directly train Qian Yi, the Paperman, with these, he could still draw insights and perhaps find some inspiration.\nSu Ping read intently. Guan Qianshan, currently the only person able to dine with him in the Heart of Woods’ private dining room, watched his serious expression.\nEventually, Guan Qianshan couldn’t hold back any longer, \"Xiao Ping!\"\n\"Hmm?\" Su Ping’s cheeks were bulging with food as he looked at Lao Guan, who had spoken.\n\"Well... Lili came today. She’s at the resort right now. The girl brought a few classmates to have some fun, and by the way...\"\nSu Ping paused, then a smile spread across his face as he remembered something, \"Alright. Has your daughter formed a contract with a Forest Wolf yet?\"\nLao Guan finally breathed a sigh of relief, \"She has, she has! The girl is very obedient, and she really likes the Forest Wolf.\"\nSu Ping nodded, unconcerned, and turned his gaze back to the Sword King’s legacy in his hand. \"Good. Have Lili come over later. She can stay here, and I’ll help her cultivate the ’Heart of Woods’!\"\nAlthough with Yun Tian’s legacy, the staffing situation was relatively less strained, Su Ping had given his word and naturally wouldn’t go back on it.\nLao Guan chuckled.\nParents who love their children always plan far ahead for them. If it weren’t for his own daughter, he wouldn’t have swallowed his pride to ask Su Ping. Over this period, he had truly and deeply understood how powerful the ’Heart of Woods’ skill was and its excellent compatibility with the Forest Wolf!\nNot long after, Su Ping saw Guan Lili, Uncle Guan’s daughter.\nUnfortunately, the circumstances of their meeting were somewhat unexpected.\n\"Quick, someone fell into the water! There are monsters in the water!\"\nA sharp voice cried out as someone rushed over from the direction of the Lingxi River, attracting the attention of everyone at the Heart of Woods service base.",

      "content": "Chapter 144: Chapter 118: The Monster in the Water, Su Ping the Protector! (Alliance Leader Bonus)\nOutside the large medical room of the Heart of Woods Pet Beast Base.\nSu Ping’s eyebrows were slightly furrowed.\nThe Heart of Woods had just connected to the Yuntian Resort, and now this trouble had arisen.\nGuan Qianshan’s face turned red with anger as he scolded a sweet-looking girl with glasses, \"I’ve told you not to come to the Lingxi River area, why wouldn’t you listen?\"\nSu Ping glanced at the girl whose eyes were red-rimmed, teardrops falling like golden beans, and then at the few similarly aged, helpless-looking teenagers standing beside her. He shook his head with a sigh and then turned to the medical Beast Tamer beside them.\nThe latter immediately understood and hastily said, \"Boss, the Beast Tamer is all right, just some water in his lungs. He coughed out most of it and will recover soon. However, the condition of the Pet Beast, the Back-Stone Turtle, is not very good. It has a wound on its neck, and the shell is slightly cracked. Even if it heals, it will probably need a long time to recover.\"\nSu Ping nodded. It was fortunate that it had been discovered quickly and treated in time; there should be no loss of life. Otherwise, while it wouldn’t directly involve Su Ping or affect the Heart of Woods’ operations, it would still reflect poorly on them.\nOnly then did Su Ping turn to the young men and women who stood there like schoolchildren being scolded, and stopped Guan Qianshan’s admonishment, saying, \"Tell me, what exactly happened?\"\nObviously, they all saw and heard the title the Beast Tamer providing treatment had used, and Lao Guan’s attitude towards him.\nIt seemed none of them had expected that this young person, who looked to be their age, was actually the owner of this place.\nThe fair-skinned Guan Lili, wearing glasses, hadn’t spoken yet when a girl next to her interjected, obviously feeling more aggrieved and frightened at the moment, \"How do you even run this Pet Beast Base? Don’t you know there are aggressive Pet Beasts in the river?\"\nSu Ping’s brows furrowed slightly, his gaze somewhat displeased.\nAnother young man beside her quickly said, \"A few of us heard that this Pet Beast Base was connected to the Lingxi River, so we went fishing to see who could catch more. Then, Lu Xiao wanted to cheat, secretly letting his Back-Stone Turtle into the water to catch fish and shrimp to put on his hook.\n\"Then... then... Lu Xiao suddenly screamed and jumped right into the river from the shore.\n\"When people came to rescue him, Lu Xiao was unconscious, and the Back-Stone Turtle was seriously injured. There was blood in the water and a dark shadow...\"\nSo it really was an attack?\nThere were definitely Pet Beasts in the Lingxi River, but I didn’t expect my luck to be so bad as to actually encounter an aggressive one.\nHowever, as these thoughts crossed Su Ping’s mind, his expression remained unchanged, and he said calmly, \"Although the Lingxi River area does indeed belong to our Cultivation Base, the path leading to the riverbanks has been sealed and marked with a prohibition sign! All outside visitors are forbidden from going there!\"\nThe path leading to Lingxi River, especially from the Yuntian Resort side, had indeed been opened, but the main reason was the need for renovations after the land deed had been obtained. Su Ping planned to introduce river water to create a large, in-house artificial lake near Lingxi River behind Yuntian Resort, to breed aquatic Pet Beasts for the future industrial development of the Heart of Woods. Another plan was to build a bridge over Lingxi River to reach the hill behind, which was the intended scope of the botanical garden Su Ping had planned. Even though there wasn’t enough money at the moment, the roads still needed to be developed.\nTherefore, this area had always been under construction, with preparations underway for the road and the early stages of excavation work. At the same time, numerous signs warning against approaching the construction site and highlighting the dangers by the riverbank had also been posted.\nSo, these reckless brats, who likely had never experienced the dangers of wild Pet Beasts and were sheltered like greenhouse flowers... Even if they really did get bitten to death, it wouldn’t have much to do with us. At most, we’d be blamed for lax supervision and have to pay some compensation, and that would be it.\nOf course, for Su Ping and the Heart of Woods at present, paying any amount of money was a significant loss.\nHowever, seemingly noticing Guan Lili being continuously scolded, the young man spoke up again, \"Also, Lili didn’t go fishing with us. She said her dad needed her for something today, so it was us who sneaked out this morning. Uncle, please don’t blame her.\"\nUpon hearing this, Guan Qianshan let out a sigh and then said to Su Ping, \"Xiao Ping, this is my fault...\"\nBefore he could finish, a clamorous voice came from the not-too-distant corridor, \"Where’s my son! Where is my son! What kind of shoddy place is this that can’t even keep an eye on a child...\"\nThe noisy commotion made Su Ping’s brows furrow quickly. He gave Lao Guan a look. Lao Guan understood and took the initiative to intercept them.\nAfter that, Su Ping turned to Guan Lili and the others and asked directly, \"Did you get a clear look at what exactly it was under the water?\"\nNormally, Lingxi River connected to West Dragon Lake. Whether on West Dragon Lake itself, the Eastern Sea entrance connected to West Dragon Lake, or the inflow from Lingxi River into West Dragon Lake, Beast Tamer Legions were stationed. The Navy Beast Tamer Legion had the strongest patrol force. Great effort had been invested to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that powerful Ferocious Beasts from the ocean did not enter Dragon Nation through the rivers.\nSo generally speaking, even if there were Pet Beasts attacking underwater, they wouldn’t be inherently very strong, because the truly powerful ones couldn’t get past West Dragon Lake.\nBut Su Ping had to take this matter seriously. Just as he’d planned, Su Ping wanted to create an artificial lake in the vast open space connecting Yuntian Resort and Lingxi River. This would require excavating the river channel, so it was crucial to eliminate any potential dangers beforehand.\nThe group glanced at each other. Guan Lili hadn’t gone, so she obviously didn’t know. It was still the young man who had spoken earlier; he thought for a moment and then said, \"It seemed like a fish, pitch-black, over a meter long, but as to what kind of Pet Beast it actually was... we didn’t get a clear view...\"\nThat’s as good as saying nothing, isn’t it?\nAquatic Pet Beasts were predominantly fish. Could it be that a bird or an Insect-type Beast bit the turtle?\nSu Ping’s brow furrowed. He suddenly felt somewhat overwhelmed.\nNeither the Paperman nor Old Sha could fight in that river, and Su Ping couldn’t possibly let them take such a risk.\nIt looked like I’d have to seek external help again. But would it be appropriate to bother Old Qin again over such a trivial matter? After all, he was the dignified president of the Beast Master Association, one of the figures at the pinnacle of Jianghai Province. It seemed a bit much for him to be constantly dealing with the trivial matters of a junior like me. This was quite different from the last Secret Realm exploration, after all.\nSu Ping rubbed his temples with some distress.\nIn that case, I could either ask Sun Chaoju or those Breeders I met at the Breeder Association if they knew any powerful Water Element Beast Tamers. Or I could directly approach companies that offer such services and pay them to handle it.\nHowever, Su Ping was currently so frugal he wished he could split every penny. Spending money to hire someone for cleanup again could cost hundreds of thousands, possibly even millions. It was a well-known fact: while not directly impacting common livelihoods, any business involving Pet Beasts was never cheap.\nSu Ping was distressed, but clearly, there was nothing he could do.\nSome money just had to be spent.\nHowever, just then, a crisp SNAP broke Su Ping’s ruminations.\nAt the same time, Guan Lili exclaimed in front of him, \"Dad!\"\nSu Ping turned his head abruptly and saw Lao Guan in the corridor, his face flushed, with an extremely clear slap mark on his cheek.\nBright red like blood.\nThe force of the slap had been so strong it made him stagger and fall to the ground.\nGuan Lili had already run over and hurriedly helped her dad up, \"Dad, are you all right?\"\nGuan Qianshan didn’t seem angry. He waved his hand dismissively but looked even more anxiously towards Su Ping.\nSure enough, Su Ping’s expression had turned pitch black.\nGuan Qianshan did not pay attention to the couple behind him and walked up to meet Su Ping, who was coming forward, \"Xiao Ping, let it go. They’re angry, and we are indeed somewhat at fault here.\"\nSu Ping gave him an odd look.\nWhy are *we* at fault? He’d just heard their account: those graduating students had sneaked out, bypassed surveillance, ignored the warning signs, and insisted on fishing by the Lingxi River. Now that something had happened, what did it have to do with his base? Was his Cultivation Base supposed to assign a dedicated attendant to them? If that’s the case, there’s no point in doing business anymore. After their Beast Taming Talent is awakened upon graduation, they are considered adults on Blue Star. Adults must be responsible for their actions; that’s basic common sense. Legally and morally, it had nothing to do with his base. And now, just because they were angry, they could hit someone?\nClearly, the couple was indeed furious. With Guan Qianshan trying to block Su Ping, they strode towards him menacingly.\nThe woman said directly, \"So you’re the one in charge here! You better give me an explanation today...\"\n\"Was it you who just hit someone?\" Su Ping interrupted.\nThe woman was startled. Looking at Su Ping who interrupted her, her elaborately drawn eyebrows furrowed, \"My son...\"\n\"Even if your son died, it has nothing to do with the Heart of Woods. Now, I’m asking you: was it you who hit him?!\"\nSu Ping generally had a good temper. His personality was also considered amiable. For instance, when Zhou Shuchen had provoked him, it was just youthful rivalry that caused no real harm. Su Ping hadn’t truly held it against him; a little ego-deflating to show him there were always stronger people out there was enough. Similarly, when Sun Chaoju initially acted arrogantly but later recognized Su Ping’s talent and willingly humbled himself to befriend Su Ping, Su Ping hadn’t put on airs either, letting bygones be bygones over a drink.\nBut Su Ping had one particular trait: he was someone who tended to be protective of his own people.\nPerhaps influenced by Su Ping’s tone, the woman’s cheeks flushed red.\nAnd it was clear that Su Ping had already gotten his answer. He turned to the man beside her who had remained silent and said, \"Your wife hit someone. I’m not an unreasonable person, but so many people are watching. So, have your wife apologize right now, and we can discuss this matter privately later.\"\n\"You little brat! My son had an accident at your place and you want me to apologize to you?\" The woman was furious.\nSu Ping, however, was still looking at the man who hadn’t spoken.\nThe man didn’t respond, but a hint of disdain flashed in his eyes. He seemed to have no intention of engaging with Su Ping, a mere child, nor did he care about the commotion. His primary concern was clearly his son Lu Xiao’s condition.\nMeanwhile, Guan Lili gently tugged at Su Ping’s sleeve and whispered, \"Brother, let’s just let it go, Lu Xiao’s family...\"\nShe didn’t continue, but the implications were clear.\nCome to think of it, that Back-Stone Turtle was a Pet Beast of a special race with Racial Potential reaching Peak Command; it was also a Dual-type Pet Beast of water and earth. Its value was even higher than Zhou Shuchen’s Crimson Fang Tiger. A family that could provide such a creature as an initial Pet Beast for their graduating son was certainly no ordinary one.\nClearly, the woman also noticed Guan Lili’s hesitance and scoffed.\nJust then, suddenly, from outside the door, a voice tinged with amusement spoke up, \"Little Brother Su, it seems you’ve encountered some trouble?\"\nSu Ping turned his head. A figure had already walked in from outside.\nJet black hair, a stunningly enchanting face, and those distinctive red lips that were deeply ingrained in his memory.\nWho could it be if not Dong Muyun?",

      "content": "Chapter 145: Chapter 119: Racial Degeneration? Cultivation of Forest Wolf and Elf Wolf!\nSu Ping’s gaze shifted from the two people before him. With a bewildered expression, he looked at the suddenly appeared Dong Muyun.\n\"What are you doing here?\"\nDong Muyun’s fox-like eyes held a smile Su Ping had never seen before. \"Listen to you! I have an exclusive room here, you know. I can come back whenever I want. We agreed on this from the beginning!\"\nThey indeed had an agreement. Previously, during the handover, she had said that the topmost room would remain hers to use indefinitely. But you’re not some idle loafer! You’re Queen Dong of Tianyun Group! Don’t you have work to do?\nHowever, these words, these questions, were clearly not for this moment. And just as clearly, some present didn’t want to see them continue their conversation.\n\"I said, what exactly is the situation with my son? How do you plan to take responsibility?\"\nSu Ping’s gaze returned to the woman, whose expression was also unpleasant. The fact that Su Ping still had the mood to ’banter and flirt’ at a time like this clearly made her extremely impatient.\nThe man beside her, however, had his gaze fixed on Dong Muyun ever since she appeared. Despite his seemingly respectable facade, an uncontrollable streak of greed seemed to flicker within him.\nBefore Su Ping could speak, Dong Muyun chuckled. \"Alright, what’s the point of wasting time showing off and humbling such insignificant people? Leave it to the staff. Don’t worry; Lao Guan was one of my subordinates, after all. He won’t be treated unfairly. I came to find you today because I genuinely have serious business to discuss.\"\nFrom start to finish, Dong Muyun’s gaze hadn’t lingered for even a moment on the couple, or indeed on anyone other than Su Ping.\nSu Ping slowly exhaled, the rising anger within him gently subsiding.\nThe couple before him, however, looked slightly startled, as if they hadn’t quite processed the turn of events. They stared at Dong Muyun with uncertainty. Even the woman’s gaze was fixed on her; clearly, Dong Muyun’s casual dismissal of them as ’insignificant people’ had wounded her pride.\nDong Muyun, however, paid them no mind. As she herself had said, as a direct daughter of the Jianghai Dong Family, she understood the rules of this world and its cold, hard class divisions better than anyone. To her, getting angry, or even wasting an extra breath on such trivial matters and insignificant people, was a waste of time. People like her were long accustomed to standing on high, observing the world from their lofty perspective. This way of looking down on others wasn’t like how humans view ants; it was an absolute, clear-eyed understanding of her own position. This was the inherent quality cultivated in a direct heir of a ’Saint-level’ Family.\nSu Ping couldn’t quite grasp this feeling, nor did he particularly want to.\nBut Dong Muyun was right about one thing: this matter indeed didn’t require his personal attention. It wasn’t worth calling in favors for such a petty issue.\nAnd indeed, it proved to be so.\nA figure slowly stepped out from behind Dong Muyun. It was another woman, with blonde hair and black-rimmed glasses. She wasn’t strikingly beautiful but possessed an air of indescribable competence.\n\"Director, Young Master Su, please leave this to me.\"\nSu Ping was momentarily taken aback, but before he could react, a fragrant breeze enveloped him as Dong Muyun put her arm around his shoulder, saying cheerfully, \"Alright, alright, let’s go!\"\nSomewhat speechless, Su Ping could only follow her into the private elevator heading to the top floor. However, glancing back briefly before the doors closed, he saw that in that short instant, SMACK!\nThe man, who moments before had worn a composed and haughty expression as if disdaining everything, now had a distorted face. He slapped the woman beside him, then turned to Lao Guan with a subservient smile never seen on him before.\nNeither Dong Muyun nor the blonde, bespectacled secretary showed any change in their utterly tranquil expressions, as if they had anticipated everything. Not the slightest flicker of attention or emotion betrayed them.\nA strange, indescribable feeling suddenly arose in Su Ping’s heart. This feeling made him realize, as if only at that moment, that he was becoming somewhat different from ordinary people. Yet, Su Ping didn’t understand what this feeling meant.\nSo, when he sat down on the sofa in Dong Muyun’s vast office, he was still pondering it.\nSeeing Su Ping lost in thought, Dong Muyun smiled faintly. \"What’s wrong? Still dwelling on that trivial matter? How about this: I’ll have that couple brought up here. I’ll tell them, right to their faces, exactly who you, Su Ping, are.\n\"You’re the Breeder Association’s soon-to-be youngest Senior Breeder! You’re the favored junior of President Qin from the Beast Master Association! You’re also the business partner I, Dong Muyun, value most!\n\"You’re a Beast Tamer and Breeder with immeasurable prospects! Want me to call President Qin over?\n\"Then, we can have that shrewish woman wail and sob, and that clueless man kneel before you and Lao Guan to apologize.\n\"If that still doesn’t appease your anger, go ahead and kill their seriously injured son. Don’t worry. Forget President Qin; with me here, not a whisper of this will get out. Even the couple themselves wouldn’t dare make a fuss.\"",

Cultivation of Forest Wolf and Elf Wolf!_2\nBecause they knew if they dared to make the slightest noise, or even reveal your name or my name, they wouldn’t leave a single trace of their existence in this world.\nHow about it? Does that satisfy you?\"\nSu Ping let out a helpless grin.\nHe absolutely believed that Dong Muyun could do everything she said.\nBut he also knew it wasn’t necessary.\nDong Muyun’s smile faded, and she didn’t sit down. Instead, she stood before the enormous, wrap-around floor-to-ceiling window, just as before, calmly observing the world.\n\"Su Ping, I’m truly envious of you, and I admire you. You possess such talent that you rose from the ranks of ordinary Beast Tamers, and you might even advance further in the future. So, I also want to tell you that in this world, people are different. You must learn to adapt to these differences, not enjoy them. And you have to strive to harness these differences.\"\nIn a past life, there were some very famous aphorisms or lines of poetry.\n’Are kings, dukes, generals, and ministers destined to be so by birth?’\n’Royal treasuries burn to ash, and noble bones trampled in the streets...’\nSentences like these are endless.\nHowever, in this traversed world of Beast Tamers, although it’s said that ordinary Beast Tamers might still have a day to stand out due to assessments and strong Beast Taming Talents, in reality, the class barriers and solidification are much more exaggerated than in the past life.\nNot to mention anything else, any transaction value related to the Pet Beast industry is astronomical. This is the most direct class barrier.\nAn average family, after a year of hard work without eating or drinking, might only save up one or two hundred thousand at most—and that’s being generous.\nBut just to cultivate a Pet Beast, considering the success rate, costs millions, and cultivating Skills on a Pet Beast offers only limited combat enhancement.\nThis is enough to show that for ordinary Beast Tamer families, it is very difficult to carve out a future on the path of Beast Taming.\nDong Muyun mentioned this lightly because she believed Su Ping, with his cunning, would be able to think things through.\nSo, Dong Muyun suddenly turned around, that indifferent demeanor she had previously shown the world instantly transformed into a warm smile,\n\"Let’s discuss our collaboration, shall we?\"\nSu Ping slowly emerged from his previous contemplation.\nLooking at Dong Muyun, whose demeanor changed so swiftly it caught him off guard, he found it hard to pinpoint which of her personas was the real one.\nWhen he thought about it like this, Qin Xiaoxue’s straightforward nature seemed much easier to get along with.\n\"What kind of collaboration? Hasn’t the Secret Realm already collapsed?\"\nDong Muyun chuckled,\n\"I have high hopes for you, so I’d like to invest in you! Tianyun is willing to commit one billion yuan in exchange for forty-nine percent of the shares in Heart of Woods. How does that sound?\"\nSu Ping frowned decisively,\n\"I won’t sell shares in Heart of Woods.\"\nSu Ping indeed was in dire need of cash; what Heart of Woods needed most right now was money!\nRenovations cost money, digging lakes costs money, creating a botanical garden costs money, perfecting the various Species Pet Beasts for each zone costs money, and building his own professional Advanced Level laboratory costs money.\nAll those different types of laboratory equipment cost money, and the vast amount of resources needed in the future to attempt the Evolution of Xiao Qing, Paperman, and others also cost money!\nWithout money, he couldn’t do anything.\nBut selling shares was out of the question.\nHeart of Woods was passed down by his old man; how could he sell it to others?\nNever mind that Dong Muyun only wanted a mere forty-nine percent, ostensibly leaving Su Ping in complete control—who knows what the future holds?\nAnd really, one billion yuan was just too cheap.\nDong Muyun wasn’t surprised by Su Ping’s outright rejection.\nShe smirked cunningly,\n\"That’s the investment value assessed by Tianyun’s board of directors and evaluation team. Of course, I haven’t told them about the Wanmu Wolf! Heh heh.\"\nAfter a pause, Dong Muyun continued,\n\"I plan to invest one hundred million yuan in Heart of Woods under my own name for a one percent share. In addition, I won’t interfere with or pry into the Pet Beast Cultivation formulas, Evolution formulas, or similar matters, nor will I try to manage them. I’ll only be responsible for profit sharing. Furthermore, I’ll use my capabilities to help resolve any manageable troubles.\nAlso, if you ever want to buy it back, you’ll have the right of first refusal, and the repurchase price won’t exceed two hundred million yuan! How does that sound?\"\nHuh?!\nSu Ping blinked.\nWell, it goes without saying that he could never agree to the initial harsh conditions.\nBut Dong Muyun’s current proposal...\nOne percent share? It wasn’t nothing, but it was practically negligible. And Su Ping understood her intention: tying their interests together was the most direct approach.\nAlthough one hundred million yuan was a drop in the bucket for the current Heart of Woods, it could certainly alleviate many pressing needs.\nClearly, the most important part of this offer wasn’t the money!\nAfter all, should he wish to buy it back later, he would retain the right of first refusal.\nSo, was this woman actually offering money to form an alliance of mutual interest with him through this investment?\n\"What kind of trouble can you solve?\"\nSu Ping looked curiously at the woman.\nDong Muyun gave a slight smile; she knew Su Ping would be tempted by such excellent conditions.",

Cultivation of Forest Wolf and Elf Wolf!_3\nShe did not make empty promises but used an example that was readily available:\n\"For instance, the dangerous Pet Beast that might exist in the Lingxi River!\"\nSu Ping gave her a suspicious glance.\nCould this woman have deliberately ’poisoned’ the water for such a reason?\nBut he didn’t voice this thought aloud.\nThat would be too cynical of me,\nhe considered.\nUltimately, Su Ping did not reject Dong Muyun’s kindness again.\nHe understood that Dong Muyun was also investing in his talent. In fact, she wouldn’t care the slightest about a one percent share of the Heart of Woods.\nLet alone now, if the monthly profit, after deducting expenses, could leave a million or so, that would be quite good. And a million in dividends would only amount to ten thousand.\nAs the Chairwoman of Tianyun Group, Dong Muyun controlled fixed assets worth hundreds of billions or even more. In terms of cash flow, she could easily overwhelm a mere Heart of Woods.\nHowever, Dong Muyun’s involvement could indeed quietly solve many troubles behind the scenes.\nFor one thing, if she had gone to Linzhou to purchase the land deed, having Tianyun Group’s Chairwoman Dong Muyun as a shareholder would likely have significantly reduced the purchase price.\nThat was the type of help she could provide on an official level. And, as in the current situation, she could quickly resolve troubles related to Pet Beasts as well.\nEven access to intelligence and special resources could be considered a channel she could provide.\nFor Su Ping, naturally, the more such channels and connections, the better.\nBeyond that, Dong Muyun also brought Su Ping help he hadn’t anticipated.\nAfter the contract was signed, Dong Muyun nodded with a smile and handed over a bank card.\n\"Here is one hundred million. You can transfer it to the Heart of Woods’ account, and in the future, deposit my dividends into this card too,\" she said.\nSu Ping nodded without much concern. However, Dong Muyun wasn’t finished. She took out a small file folder from her bosom and handed it to Su Ping.\nThe folder still retained the woman’s body heat and a faint, delicate fragrance.\nSu Ping, however, kept his composure, not daring to entertain any distracting thoughts, and was somewhat inexplicably bewildered by the folder.\n\"This is...\"\n\"I know you possess an uncommon Cultivation Talent, capable of developing the Evolution channel for the Wanmu Wolf, and you specialize as a Beast Tamer for Forest Wolves!\nHowever, since you specialize, you should delve even deeper! Inside are the complete and perfected Evolution plans for the Forest Wolf’s Forest Wolf and Elf Wolf.\"\nAs Dong Muyun spoke, a gleam of irrepressible excitement burst forth from the depths of Su Ping’s eyes, his gaze filled with eagerness.\nDong Muyun cast a slightly resentful glance at this unromantic young brat.\nAnd here I went to the trouble of preparing all this so thoughtfully,\nshe mused.\nHowever, perhaps it’s precisely because of such focused determination that he has been able to progress so far in Pet Beast Cultivation?\nSu Ping, of course, was oblivious to Dong Muyun’s thoughts at that moment; his entire attention was on the two documents in front of him.\nThe Forest Wolf and the Elf Wolf.\nThese two were currently the most popular Evolutionary Bodies of the Forest Wolf on the market.\nEspecially the Forest Wolf. It was a direct Evolution of the Forest Wolf that further strengthened its Abilities. Although the improvement wasn’t substantial, it was at least officially recognized as having evolved.\nAs the most popular Evolutionary Body, its acquisition wasn’t particularly difficult.\nSome Beast Tamers specializing in Forest Wolves were exceptionally adept at mastering it, including ones like Sun Chaoju.\nHowever, while they had mastered it, they couldn’t reveal it to just anyone.\nTheir Cultivation methods were mostly acquired through exchanges for Points within the Breeder Association.\nAnd the number of Points required was not small.\nI was planning to take out some research results, submit them to the Breeder Association to exchange for a large number of Points, and then get these two Evolutionary Bodies,\nSu Ping had been thinking.\nYes, I did consider exchanging for them,\nSu Ping affirmed to himself.\nAlthough the Wanmu Wolf is truly excellent, far exceeding my expectations, the Forest Wolf and Elf Wolf, as standard popular Evolutionary Bodies, definitely have their merits,\nhe considered.\nMoreover, my goal is to strengthen in two directions: the wolf pack and the Wood Element.\nWithin the wolf pack, I can’t just have the Wanmu Wolf as the only Evolutionary Body; a diverse wolf pack would have a mutually enhancing effect.\nAnd for the Wood Element, using the ’Forest Torrent’ battlefield strategy could greatly improve the combat capability of Plant-type Pet Beasts within it.\nI naturally want to capitalize on my advantages,\nSu Ping thought.\nHowever, I haven’t decided which Plant-type Pet Beasts to focus on cultivating in the future, and there’s no rush for now.\nFor now, the Luozisong (Pine) seems pretty good.\nStill, I’m not very familiar with Plant-type Pet Beasts. When I have time, I can visit the Pet Beast market and the Breeder Association to look around properly and see if there are any suitable ones to bring home and try raising,\nhe mused.\nAnd now, the Cultivation and Evolution methods for the Forest Wolf and Elf Wolf had just been given to Su Ping by Dong Muyun.\nSu Ping paid no mind to the fact that he was still in Dong Muyun’s office.\nHe hurriedly opened the documents and looked at the contents:\n\"The Forest Wolf is the basic Evolutionary Body of the Forest Wolf, the longest-existing Evolutionary Body of the Forest Wolf, and it is also the first choice for optimizing the Forest Wolf Race!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 148: Chapter 119: Racial Degeneration? Cultivation of Forest Wolf and Elf Wolf!_4\nSpecies optimization?\nSu Ping slightly narrowed his eyes.\nHe had come across this term before while studying the educational materials from the Breeder Association.\nHowever, this was essentially not closely related to the work of Beast Tamers and Breeders; it was a change that occurred over a long period.\nI wonder how many years ago—perhaps a few hundred or even thousands—today’s Forest Wolves were not so numerous! Instead, there was a Pet Beast called the Wood Wolf. It was a very basic Wood Element Wolf Pet, possessing only the Racial Potential of an ordinary peak species, making it a considerably Low-level Pet Beast. And the Forest Wolf was actually an Evolutionary Body of the Wood Wolf! Of course, this also seemed somewhat discernible from their names. So, the Forest Wolf was the species optimization after the initial Evolution of the Wood Wolf. After the Wood Wolf evolved into the Forest Wolf, the progeny born from Forest Wolves were new Forest Wolves.\nOf course, in ancient times, such probabilities might have been lower because a generation of evolved Forest Wolves had a greater chance of producing Wood Wolves with relatively better aptitude. Only when the evolutionary bloodline was more concentrated was there a chance for the direct birth of Forest Wolf offspring. Therefore, even in modern society, offspring produced by Forest Wolves occasionally show atavism, reverting from Forest Wolves to Wood Wolves. This is the most compelling evidence supporting this deduction.\nThe Forest Wolf, as a further Evolutionary Body of the Forest Wolf, with its relatively simple and unadorned Evolution and its widespread appeal—it’s possible similar situations might occur in the future. This could lead to Forest Wolves breeding among themselves to produce new Forest Wolves, causing the original Forest Wolves to become increasingly scarce. This is called species optimization. It’s a likely occurrence with the passage of time.\nHowever, this suddenly gave Su Ping some ideas.\nThose inherently powerful Pet Beasts, Pet Beasts with a high race limit, like the so-called Life Ancient Tree—could it be that long ago, they too were other Low-Level Pets that evolved and then underwent lengthy species optimization to become what they are now? So, could it be that some initial atavistic, degenerated forms of powerful races have actually disappeared over the long expanse of time? The history recorded in the civilization of Beast Tamers, even for the oldest Dragon Nation, doesn’t reach tens of thousands of years. Yet, the time that Living Beings have existed on Blue Star is an unimaginably vast number. It could easily be in the hundreds of millions of years.\nIf...\nThinking this, Su Ping blinked, his interest genuinely piqued.\nIf there were a way to cause powerful Pet Beasts to degenerate to their basic race, and from that foundation, either allow them to breed anew or explore other research angles to unearth different evolutionary branches... wouldn’t this mean one could develop even more, perhaps unprecedented, species of Pet Beasts and entirely new Evolutionary Bodies?\nThe answer to this is almost certainly affirmative. Some ancient Pet Beasts, in their Evolution over countless eons, were influenced by the environment, underwent subtle and gradual Evolution, or experienced survival of the fittest. However, Evolution driven by the environment can only be said to be best suited for survival in that specific environment, not necessarily the strongest or most laden with potential!\nTake the Forest Wolf as an example. After a Forest Wolf evolves into a Forest Wolf, it naturally still has a chance to evolve into the Wanmu Wolf. However, it has absolutely no chance of transforming into an Elf Wolf of the same level, because their race limit is the same: Commander-Level Peak.\nSo, for the Elf Wolf, whose Evolution focuses mainly on the Life Series and partial Elementalization—even though its direct combat strength might be less than the Forest Wolf’s, can one say its potential and utility are lower?\nNo! In fact, because of its Life Series healing abilities, the Elf Wolf could be even more useful. However, compared to the Forest Wolf, the Elf Wolf has a higher difficulty in Evolution. Furthermore, its primary abilities lie in life-healing, making its survival and overall combat effectiveness in the wild inferior to the Forest Wolf. Therefore, it is not adapted to the survival environment of Pet Beasts in the wild.\nSu Ping believed that the examples of the Forest Wolf and the Elf Wolf were definitely not unique. In those distant Ancient Times, throughout the long history of Pet Beast development, there were undoubtedly many similar weak Pet Beasts that completed their Evolution under the natural laws of survival of the fittest.\nIt remains the eternal maxim and truth of the Breeder world:\nThe weaker the Pet Beast, the more infinite its potential. The lower the tier of the Pet Beast, the more diverse its Evolution!\nThere are no truly useless Pet Beasts, only Breeders who have yet to unearth their potential.\nSo, if one wants to take this as a subject and study these possibly existent degenerated ancient species—brand new, ancient Pet Beast basic juveniles unrecorded in history—then degeneration is, paradoxically, what needs to be researched. But how can a Pet Beast’s degeneration be achieved? Especially for those incredibly powerful Pet Beasts of Advanced Level Racial Potential. Thinking about it, this research direction seems quite extravagant, doesn’t it?\nSomeone like me, not rushing to think about Evolution, but instead pondering troublesome degeneration—I’m probably the first, huh?\nSu Ping couldn’t help but smile wryly.\nHowever, at this moment, he had clearly forgotten that there was another person in the office.\nDong Muyun looked at the youngster before her with a peculiar expression.\nHas this brat already forgotten there’s another person here? He’s been staring at the first page of that document for nearly half a Xiaoshi now. What on earth is he thinking about? And now he’s making such an unsightly smile. Don’t tell me my good intentions backfired?\nUndoubtedly, from ancient times to the present, the methods by which powerful, long-standing Families maintained their continuity—just like in the world Su Ping had transmigrated from—were all the same: investment, recruitment, and marriage alliances.\nAnd Su Ping was undoubtedly a talent most worthy of investment and recruitment.\nThus, Dong Muyun coughed lightly.\nOnly then did Su Ping look at her.\n\"What are you thinking about? Have you had some other insight?\"\n\"Um...\"\nIt had to be said, now that the investment was formalized, Dong Muyun was essentially an ally. Su Ping indeed felt considerably more at ease around her and didn’t conceal anything, sharing his recent thoughts with her in full. Her background was considerable; perhaps she had some understanding in this area. Or perhaps she knew some Secret Technique for degeneration unknown to others.\nUnfortunately, Su Ping was clearly overthinking. In this world, Breeders who studied Evolution were a dime a dozen. But those who researched degeneration were exceedingly rare. Even if there were some, it was very difficult to produce any results.\nSo, Dong Muyun listened to Su Ping’s far-fetched ideas. He had extrapolated so much from just the four words ’species optimization’ and the relationship between the Forest Wolf and Elf Wolf species. He had even proposed such a bold direction—one that sounded utterly preposterous at first, but upon careful consideration, actually seemed remarkably plausible. For a moment, Dong Muyun herself became somewhat bewildered.\nIs this the thought process of a Genius Breeder? The Low-level form of a Pet Beast with Advanced Level Racial Potential before species optimization. After degeneration, explore and develop new unknown Evolutionary Bodies from other directions? Is this something that a Beast Tamer like you, merely Elite Level and a recent adult graduate, should be contemplating?\nHowever, she had to admit, in this regard, Dong Muyun was thoroughly impressed.\nThen she became flustered and could only stammer, \"Uh... I... I really don’t know...\"\nShe couldn’t deny Su Ping’s ideas, yet she was also unable to provide any advice or help.\nSo Dong Muyun, who had originally wanted to further close the distance with this brat, could only choose to change the subject very awkwardly, \"Anyway, I’ll go check out what’s happening in the Lingxi River!\"\nSu Ping also came back to his senses.\nThe matter of species optimization, as well as Evolution and degeneration, was naturally just a topic and direction worthy of research. However, for the current Su Ping, the difficulty was still too great.\nThinking this, and since it concerned his own territory, Su Ping didn’t remain idle. He nodded and said, \"I’ll go with you to take a look!\"\nSu Ping also wanted to see what exactly was causing harm in the area near his territory.",

      "content": "Chapter 149: Chapter 120: Rainbow Coral! The Most Special Aquatic Pet Beast?\nArriving at the spot pointed out by Guan Lili and the others, Su Ping once again looked over this part of the Lingxi River.\nThen, under Su Ping’s envious gaze, Dong Muyun said softly, \"Yunning!\"\nInstantly, Dong Muyun extended her hand, and a mechanical voice came from the watch on her wrist, \"Master, awaiting your commands!\"\n\"Switch to single underwater combat form and detach for remote control!\"\n\"Yes, Master!\"\nThe mechanical voice replied. Then, with a faint electronic whirring sound, the watch detached from Dong Muyun’s wrist.\nThe next moment, a specially-shaped individual robot appeared and, with a PLOP, jumped into the water.\nDong Muyun, meanwhile, leisurely took out a tablet. After a few taps, the live underwater feed from Yunning appeared on its screen.\nThe deep underwater world appeared pitch-black. Fortunately, Yunning was equipped with an extremely powerful searchlight that illuminated everything in its beam.\nSu Ping had never imagined that the Lingxi River connected to his home would be so deep.\nAs Yunning dove deeper, Su Ping could clearly see it had already descended more than thirty meters.\nThe surging undercurrents and the pitch-black underwater environment made Su Ping feel a sense of unfamiliarity and terror.\nHowever, even more terrifying than the environment itself was what had now appeared before their eyes!\nSu Ping had never, ever considered that the Lingxi River, so close to his home, would be teeming with such a vast number of aquatic Pet Beasts!\nYes, as Yunning continued its descent and finally reached the pitch-black riverbed, the surroundings were revealed to be filled with what could only be described as dense swarms of aquatic Pet Beasts!\nSpiny Scaled Fish, Glint Fish, Rose Poison Stingray, Dual-Horned Tiger Fish, Ghostly Tuna...\nMany aquatic Pet Beasts were identified by Su Ping in just this short time.\nAnd these were only the ones he recognized; there were many more he didn’t.\nThe highest Level among them had even reached Commander Level.\nThis was effectively the apex for common aquatic Pet Beasts found inland.\nBut both Su Ping and Dong Muyun sensed that something was amiss.\nThe reason was simple: there were just too many of them!\nEven though the Lingxi River wasn’t far from West Dragon Lake, the occasional passage of a few Pet Beasts would have been normal. But how many were there now?\nA rough estimate suggested there were definitely more than a hundred, without a doubt.\nKeep in mind, these were Ranked Pet Beasts!\nMoreover, this was only in the area Yunning had explored, a section of water merely thirty to fifty meters deep.\nSeeing this, Su Ping broke out in a cold sweat.\nDuring the past month or so, he had played more than once with the little Paperman on the banks of the Lingxi River.\nAlthough it was some distance from this spot, it wasn’t that far.\nAnd while most aquatic Pet Beasts don’t leave the water, higher-Level ones could still fight on land.\nIf any of the Commander Level Pet Beasts they had just seen had appeared on the bank back then...\nSu Ping didn’t dare to complete the thought.\nFortunately, they had discovered it now.\nDong Muyun, however, showed no surprise. Instead, a hint of excitement glinted in her eyes.\nSuch a bizarre scene definitely had a reason behind it!\nUsually, even in the Pet Beast World, the principle of ’big fish eat small fish, and small fish eat shrimp’ applies.\nTherefore, these Commander Level fish would not normally coexist in the same area with lower-Level ones. Otherwise, the latter would have already been devoured.\nBut now, while it couldn’t be called peaceful coexistence, at least no such rampant slaughter was occurring.\nHowever, Yunning’s powerful searchlight did attract attacks from many fish.\nOf course, for Yunning, which had reached Monarch Level, this was no threat. Several Low-level, less intelligent fish were lured in by the intense light and quickly dispatched by Yunning.\nThe higher-Level ones, seeing the newcomer’s ferocity, immediately turned and fled without a second thought.\nInstantly, a clear zone formed in the chaotic underwater depths.\n\"Yunning, continue exploring ahead. Let’s see what’s really going on down here!\"\nYunning, in its underwater robot form, moved swiftly forward, propelled by its arms and the mechanical fins on its body.\nFinally, after it swam about another three hundred meters, a glimmer of light appeared at the edge of the searchlight’s beam, seeming to reflect it.\nIt was a splendidly colorful light.\nThe moment it appeared and interacted with the searchlight, it created an indescribable rainbow-like shimmer in the pitch-black water.\n\"What is this...\" Dong Muyun murmured, then quickly instructed, \"Yunning, keep moving forward.\"\nThe rapid current had no effect on the distant rainbow light. This time, even when illuminated by the searchlight, the schools of fish around the light showed no startled reaction, as if they hadn’t noticed anything at all.\nThey continued to circle that Rainbow Light, their swaying movements showing complete enthrallment with the object at the center!\nYunning loyally fulfilled Dong Muyun’s command. Carrying the searchlight, it moved slowly through the water, finally approaching within ten meters of the light’s source.\nSimultaneously, the source of the light became clear through the relatively clear water.\nIt was located within a crevice in the riverbed, where an undercurrent flowed.\nIt was an incredibly large coral!\nEasily over ten meters across, it was nestled in this crevice on the riverbed.\nThe coral glowed with a fluorescent light, beautiful and mysterious.\nIt wasn’t just the fish that saw it underwater with their own eyes; even Su Ping and Dong Muyun, observing from Yunning’s perspective onshore, couldn’t help but show looks of fascination.\nThis thing was too beautiful!\nFrom any angle, it emanated a colorful, misty glow.\nCombined with the schools of fish also illuminated in these brilliant colors as they circled the coral, the scene resembled a true underwater paradise.\nBut clearly, this thing was anything but paradise.\nIn fact, its essence wasn’t that of an incredibly precious resource at all. It was a Pet Beast!\nStaring at it, Dong Muyun finally asked uncertainly, \"Rainbow Coral?\"\nHer voice held an indescribable mixture of joy and shock.\nSu Ping looked at her. He was still too young, and even with his current achievements, it was impossible for him to recognize all Pet Beasts.\nThis was especially true for aquatic Pet Beasts, which were incredibly numerous, with many still unknown.\nUndoubtedly, the one before them was such a case!\n\"What is a Rainbow Coral?\"\nPleased at this rare instance of the usually knowledgeable young man’s ignorance, Dong Muyun explained excitedly while watching the footage, \"It’s one of the most special and precious aquatic Pet Beasts. Nominally, it’s a Water Element Pet Beast, but it’s a unique type combining Insect and Elemental characteristics. Its Racial Potential is extremely low, and it completely lacks combat abilities, yet it is extremely valuable!\"\n\"Oh? Why is that?\" Su Ping asked, his curiosity piqued.\nIn the Pet Beast World, there were countless magical Pet Beasts with all sorts of astounding abilities. Not all could be measured simply by combat power. And quite evidently, this Rainbow Coral was one such exception.\nBecause Dong Muyun had already begun to explain its purpose.\n\"The Rainbow Coral Worm is a very special kind of Pet Beast,\" she continued. \"They possess no combat capabilities and can hardly even move without external forces. However, no Water Element Beast Tamer can resist the allure of the Rainbow Coral Worm! This is because the Rainbow Coral Worm creates such a Rainbow Light around itself, attracting schools of Pet Beast Fish. Furthermore, water touched by this Rainbow Light can effectively nourish aquatic Pet Beasts! This allows the fish to thrive without needing to consume large quantities of food. Moreover, rumors say that aquatic fish-type Pet Beasts spending extended periods near the Rainbow Light not only experience faster Level growth than usual but also have a chance to comprehend the Special Skill ’Rainbow Aurora.’\"\nSu Ping blinked, looking once more at the massive coral, easily over ten meters in size.\nThe Pet Beast World was indeed full of wonders. There really were such special Pet Beasts?\nAt the same time, a burning desire surged in Su Ping’s heart.\nHowever, what Su Ping didn’t expect was that there was even more.\nDong Muyun paused, then continued, \"Additionally, the beautiful Rainbow Coral formed by the worm’s secretions is also an excellent material for Water Element Pet Beasts. If the Tianyun Group could obtain a Rainbow Coral Worm for Crescent Island, then its endeavors there would become smoother by an unimaginable factor!\"\nSu Ping narrowed his eyes slightly. \"Is this thing really that rare?\"\n\"Extremely rare!\" Dong Muyun affirmed. \"There are three reasons. First, the attracted fish schools can sometimes bring in powerful aquatic Pet Beasts. These Pet Beasts are very domineering. If the Rainbow Light cannot satisfy their hunger, they will directly consume the Rainbow Coral. Even a slight bump could cause its death.\n\"Second, unlike other coral worms, while the outer coral structure appears large, there is actually only one Rainbow Coral Worm inside. They are mostly solitary creatures.\n\"Third, and most importantly, is their method of reproduction. Generally, a Rainbow Coral Worm only reproduces asexually when the previous generation dies. Most of the time, it lays only a single egg, with an infinitesimal chance of producing two. However, despite the protection of the outer Rainbow Coral, any mishap can cause the fragile eggs or newly born Rainbow Coral larvae to die. Furthermore, the coral worm’s growth cycle is very short, with a lifespan typically only three to five years.\"\nDong Muyun recited these facts as if enumerating treasured heirlooms.\nIt was apparent that her earlier decision to send Lao Guan to Crescent Island for aquatic Pet Beast Cultivation was no joke; the Tianyun Group was indeed seriously pursuing this direction.\nNaturally, they had thoroughly researched such a rare Pet Beast.\nShe didn’t notice, however, that Su Ping’s eyes were now shining as he gazed at the Rainbow Coral Worm in the footage.\nIf he could get this Rainbow Coral Worm into his artificial lake, wouldn’t the Heart of Woods have a new industry?",

(Alliance Leader Bonus)\nIt’s capable of producing resources: Rainbow Coral.\nAlthough the rank of these coral polyps isn’t high, considering how rare this thing is, the value of this resource must be around Commander Level, right?\nIt can attract schools of aquatic Pet Beasts. So, if I connect the artificial lake with the Lingxi River and take some measures, I just need to prevent large and powerful Pet Beasts from arriving.\nThen, I could set up a paid fishing activity on this artificial lake. That wouldn’t be excessive, would it?\nOf course, fishing is fishing. However, the fish you catch aren’t necessarily yours to keep. After all, these Rainbow Corals attract schools of aquatic Pet Beasts.\nAre these ordinary fish?\nAt most, whoever catches them can sell them back to me at a fraction of the market price. HEY!\nA single venture could earn double the money! And what’s most important, this business very likely wouldn’t require any initial investment!\nSu Ping had been thinking earlier. Although buying Pet Beasts for the botanical garden, the Undead basement, and the Forest Wolf packs required money, it was nothing compared to the cost of purchasing aquatic Pet Beasts for the artificial lake.\nWho would have thought that the Pet Beast business could be run without any initial investment?\nEven with the Beast Tamer Legions present, there wouldn’t be too many Pet Beasts coming in and out of the connection point between the Lingxi River and West Dragon Lake.\nBut that’s relative to the entirety of Jianghai Province and the Lingxi River, which flows through both Jianghai and Huaiyang Provinces.\nIn fact, as one of the main waterways leading to the sea, how many aquatic Pet Beasts pass through the Lingxi River daily?\nIt’s impossible to calculate!\nAnd now, if I have this, do I still need to buy aquatic Pet Beasts to raise?\nThat would be an utter luxury.\nOnce these coral polyps are placed, to the passing schools of fish, it’s an irresistible lure, like Tang Monk’s flesh.\nSu Ping’s gaze was clearly too intense.\nDong Muyun finally snapped out of her excitement. When she noticed Su Ping’s fervent gaze, her eyelids twitched.\n\"Su Ping, you shouldn’t need this, right? Isn’t Heart of Woods mainly focused on the Forest Wolf cultivation industry?\"\nSu Ping chuckled,\n\"To be honest, I’ve already bought all the land behind Yun Tian, including the banks of the Lingxi River and that deserted mountain five kilometers away. I was planning to dig an artificial lake on the land behind Yun Tian that connects to the Lingxi River. Otherwise, why would I have cleared out the aquatic Pet Beasts near the Lingxi River that might harbor aggressive intentions?\"\nDong Muyun pursed her lips,\n\"The problem is, I discovered this Rainbow Coral, and Yunning is still down there...\"\nSu Ping shifted his gaze from the Rainbow Coral—seen through Yunning’s perspective—back to Dong Muyun and blinked.\n\"But, as I just said, I’ve bought all the land deeds for this area. According to Article Nine of the Dragon Nation’s Land Protection Law...\"\n\"...\"\nDong Muyun clenched her fists, wishing she could punch this smug brat who was so easily rattling off the land protection law.\nIt’s the land deeds again! Always the land deeds!\nPreviously, with the Secret Realm, she was constrained by this brat because of those damned land deeds, and now it’s happening again because of this blasted land deed!\nI hate real estate!\nShould Tianyun Group transition into real estate? Who knows, there might be some incredible treasure on that plot of land!\nNo, that can’t be right. If that were the case, the world would be full of lucky people.\nIt’s purely this brat’s ridiculously good luck.\nDong Muyun took a slow, deep breath.\n\"How about this: you’ve always wanted a Mechanical Core, right? Tianyun Group will offer two billion, plus a Mechanical Core, in trade. That should be sufficient, shouldn’t it?\"\nHowever, Su Ping shook his head again.\n\"Your cultivation base is only so big. Even if you manage to build an artificial lake, getting it to a few kilometers in diameter would be a feat. Using this Rainbow Coral on it would be an extravagant waste, wouldn’t it?!\"\nDong Muyun was exasperated.\nThe area behind Yun Tian was only a few kilometers from the Lingxi River at most.\nUnder such circumstances, even if Su Ping wanted to build an artificial lake, how large could it possibly be?\nSu Ping didn’t even blink,\n\"I’ve changed my mind. I’ve decided to expand the artificial lake’s scale. I’ll directly connect the area behind Yuntian Resort to the Lingxi River and then extend it southward. It will form a large, Taiji-shaped artificial lake with the Lingxi River as the dividing line. I conservatively estimate its diameter to be about twenty kilometers.\"\nDong Muyun was out of options.\nShe sighed helplessly. Seeing Dong Muyun looking defeated and ready to give up, Su Ping quickly said,\n\"Look, we’re in the same boat now. Besides, you hold shares in Heart of Woods; nominally, you’re the second-largest shareholder after my family! If Heart of Woods becomes powerful, wouldn’t that be much better than Tianyun Group? You’re the chairperson of Tianyun Group, but it’s not entirely yours, is it? Your Dong Family has so many brothers and sisters. What if someone else takes over? Wouldn’t all your efforts just be paving the way for someone else?\"\nSu Ping had laid it all out.\nDong Muyun, however, just glared at this brat who was gloating after getting his way.\nIt was true that she personally held only five percent of Tianyun Group’s shares. However, her father’s and brother’s shares, totaling twenty percent, were managed by her.\nAside from her grandfather, who had relinquished his authority, she was the Dong Family’s largest shareholder in Tianyun Group. She was the actual person in charge, second only to her grandfather, the highest authority.",

How to bring out its most appropriate effects?\"\nSu Ping’s eyes lit up, and he quickly flattered,\n\"I don’t know, please teach me, sister!\"\nSu Ping wasn’t an all-rounder; he couldn’t possibly know everything about business models and the breeding of various Pet Beasts.\nLet alone the fact that he had never even heard of the Rainbow Coral Worm before.\n\"TSK TSK, now you know to call me sister. But it’s a pity, I, your sister who only knows money and profits, am afraid I’m not as good as the younger and prettier Miss Qin.\"\nSu Ping touched his nose somewhat awkwardly.\nFortunately, Dong Muyun didn’t tease him any further and directly said,\n\"To raise the Rainbow Coral Worm, you need to prepare Star Algae, which is its favorite food. Secondly, to be able to approach the Rainbow Coral Worm in the water at any time, and simultaneously prevent passing schools of fish from harming it, you need to isolate it.\"\n\"Isolate?\"\nSu Ping frowned slightly.\nIf it were isolated, how could the schools of fish use the Rainbow Water tainted by the glow of the Rainbow Coral Worm? How could they comprehend the so-called Rainbow Aurora under its light? How could the halo of the Rainbow Coral Worm continue to attract schools of fish?\nFrom Dong Muyun’s description, Su Ping had never considered making this precious little creature a Pet Beast.\nAfter all, a Pet Beast that at best lived a few years—you know, when a Pet Beast reached its lifespan, if you tried to artificially prolong its life, that would consume the Beast Tamer’s own Origin.\nAlthough the Rainbow Coral Worm was precious, it was purely a Resource Type Pet Beast and not suitable as a battle-type Contracted Beast.\nAt least in the short term, Su Ping had no such thoughts. Since that was the case, if the Rainbow Coral Worm can’t provide resources when isolated, what was the point?\nBut fortunately, Dong Muyun wasn’t the type to play coy and directly explained with a smile,\n\"That’s right. It’s just that the materials for isolation are different. You need a special material from the Water Elemental Series: Water Element Barrier!\"\nSu Ping slapped his forehead.\nHe had been silly. How could he apply the physical knowledge of his previous world to measure things in this magical world?\nThe Water Element Barrier, a special Elemental Type material, is a water-based barrier that can block most solids but does not hinder the flow of water.\nIt is a special material sometimes used in Water Element Pet Beast venues.\nHowever, Su Ping had never encountered it before, so he quickly flashed a flattering smile again and looked towards Dong Muyun.\nShe also laughed. On those cheeks, as charming and delicate as roses, every smile she wore couldn’t help but make one feel a twinge of fear.\nAnd sure enough, as soon as Dong Muyun opened her mouth, Su Ping felt what cataclysm meant.\n\"Tianyun Group sells it! A square meter is only priced at five hundred thousand! Tianyun Group can customize the desired shape, space, and size for customers. They also assist with installation, regular maintenance, and repairs, including warranty after damage.\"\nSu Ping’s vision darkened.\nFive hundred thousand didn’t sound like much.\nBut that was the price for just one square meter!\nNot to mention, the Rainbow Coral Worm itself, along with the connected coral, was already over ten meters wide. You couldn’t really leave it with no space, right?\nIn that case, how would it continue to secrete Rainbow Coral?\nThis was a resource and material!\nIt was the only resource material that Heart of Woods could foreseeably produce on its own!\nSo, if they went by what Dong Muyun said, disregarding other factors, just in terms of length and width, one side of the enclosure would need to be twenty meters.\nThe four sides of a square enclosure together would mean eighty square meters of barrier material if it were one meter high.\nTherefore, not considering height, surrounding the Rainbow Coral with a one-meter-high Water Element Barrier would require a whopping forty million!\nBut how could one not consider the height issue?\nThe secreted coral needed to attach itself to soil or rocks to coexist.\nSo, stacking this Water Element Barrier from the bottom of the lake upwards—if their artificial lake was ten meters deep, they’d multiply the forty million base amount by ten, which amounted to a whopping four hundred million!\nFour hundred million!\nAnd that was just for ten meters of height.\nIn fact, if they really calculated according to the depth of that artificial lake, with Lingxi River at the center—that is, where the Rainbow Coral Worm was right now—the height of the Water Element Barrier needed from the Lingxi River down to the riverbed would be nearly one hundred meters...\nFour billion?\nSu Ping only felt darkness before his eyes.\nDong Muyun had clearly foreseen this scenario and was watching Su Ping with a smile.\nSu Ping said with a sheepish smile, \"That...\"\n\"This is already the discounted price! As you know, there’s a reason why Tianyun Group’s products are expensive. If you buy this kind of material from somewhere else, they won’t take care of it after installation, you know! If an accident happens later on and the Water Element Barrier has a breach, Tianyun Group offers a twenty-year warranty with free replacement!\"\nIndeed, once Dong Muyun put it that way, it did seem like there was good reason for it to be expensive.\nIt’s just, what’s with that damn woman’s tone?\nSu Ping clenched his fists!\nMoney is the courage of heroes, gold is the backbone of men! Indeed, a man must not be without money.\nTherefore, Su Ping thought for a moment and asked,\n\"They say beneath a man’s knees lies gold. Can I use the gold beneath my knees to offset the cost?\"\nDong Muyun smiled and said,\n\"I have no use for that. And besides, what if Miss Qin tries to fight me to the death over it? However, there is something you could use to offset the price!\"\n\"Oh?\"\nSu Ping’s eyes lit up.\n\"For instance, further shares of Heart of Woods!\"\nThe smiling Dong Muyun at this moment seemed like a fox incessantly wagging its tail.\nUnfortunately, Su Ping didn’t take the bait, watching the woman warily.\n\"No way! Just a symbolic one percent is fine!\"\nOne percent of the shares was what Su Ping used to form a certain alliance with this woman. If it went any further, it would be different, and he naturally refused without hesitation.\nEven if he could recover it, Su Ping didn’t want to take that risk any further.\nDong Muyun didn’t seem disappointed and just shrugged her shoulders.\n\"Well, then there’s nothing we can do!\"\nSu Ping sighed, somewhat worried.\nMoney, oh money. Why is it that despite having the skill to slay dragons and earning money at a rate far beyond any other Breeder’s imagination, the money was becoming increasingly harder to hold onto, and the damn holes just kept getting bigger?\nDong Muyun was not in a hurry either.\nShe watched with a smile as Su Ping racked his brains, trying to figure out ways to get money.\nHowever, clearly, while Dong Muyun was not in a hurry, something at that moment was.\n「Below Lingxi River.」\nYunning, having transformed into an underwater robot, scratched its smooth, bald head with arms controlled by its awakened mechanical intelligence. Its mechanical eyes, emitting the light of searchlights, showed a hint of bewilderment.\nWhat is Master doing? It’s still soaking in the water. At this moment, Yunning, as a mechanical life form, also felt that everything around it was dark and lonely.",

      "content": "Chapter 152: Chapter 122: Su Ping’s Ten-Day Diary, the Second Wanmu Wolf!\nTen days passed in the blink of an eye.\nDuring this period, almost every day, the entire Heart of Woods was undergoing earth-shattering changes.\nOn the first day, designers and architects were hired to discuss and mark out the area of the backyard connecting to the Lingxi River.\nOn the second day, the architect in charge summoned Earth-type Pet Beasts: the Plowing Ox and the Gravel Bee. These two Pet Beasts were tasked with tilling the ground and paving a path.\nBehind the Forest Wolf Forest, extensive Wolf Tobacco grasslands bordering the Lingxi River were cleared and converted into arable land. Of course, Su Ping still retained a portion for future research on Wolf Tobacco.\nSu Ping designated this area to build his laboratory. Because it was situated behind the Forest Wolf Forest and not far from the Lingxi River, this spot was the most remote, quiet, and safest.\nOn the third and fourth days, the road connecting the Heart of Woods to Yuntian Resort was paved, and the necessary land preparation was completed. Simultaneously, teams of Mountain Mover Apes began the excavation!\nThe cost for the two construction crews, plus design fees, was approximately fifteen million.\nOn the fifth day, materials for the thirty-million-cost protective fence were purchased, and installation began. The fence started from the Forest Wolf Forest within the Heart of Woods and extended to encompass the entire area north of the Lingxi River, including the vast expanse Su Ping planned for his artificial lake.\nThis was a very special material that could not only withstand attacks from powerful Pet Beasts but also emitted a specific scent that discouraged Pet Beasts from voluntarily approaching the fence.\nLuckily, the thirty-million cost also included installation fees.\nIndeed, these products were from the Tianyun Group.\nOn the sixth and seventh days, the Mountain Mover Apes continued digging the artificial lake. Underwater, certain seagrass plants were planted, and rocks beneficial to aquatic Pet Beasts were also placed. This part didn’t cost much—less than ten million—leaving a significant amount remaining.\nOn the eighth day, the excavation of the artificial lake on the north bank of the Lingxi River was completed. If desired, it could be connected to the Lingxi River at any time to draw water. Simultaneously, professional landscape artists were again invited to provide some aesthetic landscaping around the artificial lake, which Su Ping had named ’Heart Lake.’\nOn the tenth day, the fence installation was completed. The Heart of Woods purchased several internal sightseeing cars for one million, and a professional bridge builder was called to the bank of the Lingxi River, beside Heart Lake, to survey for bridge construction.\nThey spent an entire day on research and discussion.\nA construction plan was developed for a bridge spanning the Lingxi River at a point over two hundred meters wide. The total cost for materials and labor was estimated at over twenty million.\nIn fact, normally, it wouldn’t require such an expenditure.\nHowever, Su Ping opted for the most robust materials and special construction techniques, incorporating filters on both sides of the bridge.\nOnce connected to his artificial lake, these filters would prevent larger aquatic Pet Beasts from entering Heart Lake from the Lingxi River, ensuring maximum safety.\nThus, of the one hundred million Dong Muyun had invested, more than half was spent on the construction of the Heart of Woods in just ten days.\nAnd the spending wasn’t over yet.\nOnce the connection to the Lingxi River was established, the expenses for the wilderness botanical garden on the other side, and for other areas Su Ping had yet to plan, would be enormous.\nPaving roads and erecting fences alone, not to mention other things, would incur an exorbitant cost.\nDuring these ten days, Su Ping rarely left his residence, except to occasionally supervise construction. He spent the rest of his time at the Heart of Woods, attending to his own affairs.\nIn these same ten days, the experiences Su Ping gained and the tasks he undertook were, much like the transformations at the Heart of Woods, immensely significant!\nSu Ping recorded these changes in his Breeder’s diary almost every day:\nThe first day:\n’October 1st, clear. Continued with the cultivation of the ten Legion Forest Wolves.’\n’Went to the Linzhou Center and purchased a large quantity of Soul-Settling Paper, Undead Crystals, and bought another eleven Papermen. Started their rearing and feeding. It cost me over five million.’\n’Ah, what a fulfilling day! It’s just a pity I’ve been too busy these past few days and have somewhat neglected meditation; the enhancement of my spiritual power hasn’t been very noticeable.’\nThe second day:\n’October 2nd, clear. Among the twenty-two Papermen, one Paperman’s Paper Body Folding skill reached the Proficient Level. Its folding speed is faster, and perhaps it can also perform more complex transformations?’\n’All ten Forest Wolves of the Beast Tamer Legion completed their Photosynthesis cultivation.’\n’And among these ten Forest Wolves, the Wood Heart Skill of four of them reached the Proficient Level! Although the remaining six didn’t improve their skill level, one could see a significant leap in their skill proficiency!’\n’Indeed, the evolutionary steps of the Wanmu Wolf significantly accelerated the improvement of the Wood Heart Skill.’\n’Oops, I forgot about my meditation again. Oh well, I’ll deal with it tomorrow.’\nThe third day:\n’October 3rd, clear turning to cloudy with a north wind. I received good news this morning: little Paperman Qian Yi’s Paper Body Folding also reached the Proficient Level, and along with it, seven other Papermen did the same.’",

Heh, I didn’t expect to have an accidental discovery; it’s just a pity that it requires (erased) a bit too much. And there’s no need for that at the moment.\nBut the Forest Wolf is one thing; the Elf Wolf is really interesting. It gradually abandons the body of the Forest Wolf, turning towards a semi-elementalized wolf form. It’s a shame I don’t know if there is a corresponding Evolutionary Body for the Elf Wolf. Has it completed the transition from an animal-type Pet Beast to an Elemental Type?\nAs expected, no Evolutionary Body is simple; my journey is still long.\nUnfortunately, searching for the Evolution of the Elf Wolf wasted too much time, and it seems like I won’t have time for meditation today.\nDay Four:\nOctober 4th, overcast. Such annoying weather.\nSo today, after briefly taking care of the Forest Wolf’s cultivation, I went to the basement’s Paperman area where the sky can’t be seen.\nTo try out how many Paper Swords Qian Yi could control at the same time, I tested it with him for quite a while. I even let Xiao Qing and Qian Yi try sparring against each other for the first time. The result was actually a draw?\nClearly, neither Xiao Qing nor Qian Yi were in good spirits. Xiao Qing, because it’s at Elite Level, yet failed to defeat an Ordinary Level Pet Beast.\nAnd Qian Yi was annoyed because, despite having so many Paper Swords and its Jinge Technique having reached Perfection, it still ended up in a tie.\nHowever, what was consistent was that although both little guys were upset, they both became more diligent. Indeed, appropriate internal competition is a good thing.\nIt’s just that I’m out of time for meditation again.\nSu Ping, oh Su Ping, you can’t neglect your own meditation while cultivating Pet Beasts!\nDay Five:\nOctober 5th, cloudy. Is it going to rain?\nOne of the Papermen’s Paper Body Joint Skill reached Proficient Level. However, no obvious changes have been noticed. Obviously, this has not yet satisfied the basic requirements for Evolution, whether it’s the Skills or its own Level.\nFortunately, over these past few days, all the Papermen have advanced from First Rank to Second Rank after consuming Soul-Settling Paper and a large number of Undead Crystals.\nThat woman Dong Muyun came again. Doesn’t she have anything better to do?\nShe insisted on having a couple of drinks with me, drunkenly blabbering about the difficulties of large families, conspiracies, and such. I don’t understand. Can it really be harder than for those impoverished families who can’t even afford Pet Beasts?\nSo, after all the nonsense this woman spouted, all I wanted to do was go back and meditate.\nDay Six:\nOctober 6th, light rain. I really hope this damn weather will end soon. Praise the Sun!\nToday’s cultivation endeavor showed breakthrough progress!\nAmong the ten Legion Evolutionary Body Forest Wolves I’m cultivating, Xiao Qiang—whose Sunlight Absorption Skill was only at Proficient Level—had its Photosynthesis also rise to Proficient Level, nurtured by Smile-Faced Sunflower seeds and sunlight spring water!\nDue to this damn weather, this progress is much slower than it was with Old Sha, but thankfully, I have finally completed one.\nThe Forest Wolf has met the minimum requirements for Evolution into Wanmu Wolf and has entered the third stage of the Wanmu Wolf cultivation process, beginning to store Energy in preparation for Evolution.\nI want to see just how much potential difference there is between a Forest Wolf evolved with Proficient Level Sunlight Absorption and one with Perfection Level.\nGood timing. I should also apply for some more resources from the Legion!\nI wonder if there are materials for a Water Elemental Barrier in the Legion’s storages. I really want to get up close with the Rainbow Coral Worm. Because there’s a reason I can’t write in this diary.\nTurns out they really do! After talking to Commander Zhang about the new materials and the cultivation progress, I exchanged some Battle Merit Points for a Water Elemental Barrier. It’s just a pity that there’s again no time for meditation.\nDay Seven:\nOctober 7th, partly cloudy. The sun has come out. That’s nice.\nAll the Papermen have reached Proficient Level in both Paper Body Folding and Paper Body Joint, but only the little Paperman Qian Yi’s Mutation Paper Body Control Skill remains at Entry Level. This is truly frustrating.\nAt the same time, two of the Legion’s Forest Wolves with Sunlight Absorption at Master Level—’Dull Head’ and ’Dull Brain’—have reached the required Photosynthesis Level and started to store Energy alongside them.\nThe Legion is really fast! I made the call yesterday, and they’ve already delivered today!\nThe Water Elemental Barrier is fascinating. It can be touched by hand and even picked up as if it’s transparent glass. But when you pour water on it, the water goes straight through. What kind of physical Rule is this? What kind of liquids can it actually block?\nCan liquid metal, like mercury, pass through it?\nI’ll get Dong Muyun to take this Water Elemental Barrier back to Tianyun Group for basic processing first!\nI have to pay this woman the processing fee again. Really detestable. But at least the processing comes with a warranty.\nIt’s a shame that the meditation time I reserved for today was interrupted by a phone call from Miss Qin.\nDay Eight:\nOctober 8th, sunny. Praise the Sun.\nAn unremarkable day. The only thing worth mentioning is that two more Forest Wolves in my home have broken through to Elite Level! That includes Little Ones! Heart of Woods is truly flourishing more and more!\nBut Miss Qin called again in the evening.\nSure enough, Su Anyong was right: women only disrupt my progress in meditation.\nDay Nine:\nOctober 9th, sunny. Praise the Sun.\nXiao Qing’s Level has increased, reaching Second Rank Elite. The little guy is so hardworking; I can feel a significant boost to my spiritual power!\nIs it possible that if a Pet Beast keeps breaking through, its master won’t need to engage in meditation anymore?\nMiss Qin called again.\nShe wants me to visit Magic Capital Academy in two months, before the end of the year?\nBefore the year’s end... I wonder if it will conflict with the Breeder Competition?\nAnd why do I feel a little nervous about it?\nDay Ten:\nOctober 10th, sunny. The Sun loves me so much; I’ll sing a song for the Sun.\nAn exhilarating day!\nIndeed, for a Forest Wolf with only Proficient Level Sunlight Absorption to evolve into a Wanmu Wolf, the required Evolution Energy is minimal. In just these few days, using only two Elite Level materials, ’Gyro Pine Nuts’ and ’Whitewisker Grass,’ and one Low-level Commander resource, ’Green Phosphorus Fruit,’ the Evolution was completed!\nThe Evolution was successful! The second Wanmu Wolf has finally appeared!\nIndeed, there’s quite a gap in potential compared to Old Sha; it barely reached the Racial Potential of a First Stage Monarch! Also, it didn’t comprehend the ’Life Magnetic Field’ Skill!\nI don’t know if it’s unable to comprehend it or just hasn’t yet, much like Old Sha didn’t comprehend the Blinding Technique.\nBut it’s good enough that its Racial Potential can reach First Stage Monarch; that’s quite incredible!\nSunlight Absorption being only at Proficient Level means it doesn’t need many cultivation resources. It needs neither Lungs of Nature nor Sun Crystals—only a massive amount of Sunlight Springwater, a large quantity of Smile-Faced Sunflower Seeds, and subsequent resources for accumulating Evolution Energy. Adding it all up, the total Evolution cost is roughly between 15,000,000 to 20,000,000!\nSuch a cost for the Evolution of a Wanmu Wolf that can reach Monarch Level potential—in Old Liu’s words, this year’s Breeder Competition should be no problem.\nMoreover, after completing the Evolution, Xiao Qiang’s Level directly broke through from Elite Peak to Third Rank Commander! Not bad at all!\nMost importantly! I finally managed to get some meditation in today! Nothing should disturb me now, right?\nSu Ping’s days passed uneventfully, as succinctly summed up by the few words in his diary.\nHowever, it was obviously quite different for others.\nIt would be truly strange if the masters, connected by Soul Contracts, couldn’t feel the Evolution of their Pet Beasts and such significant breakthroughs.\nOver the past month or so, the Legion had maintained absolute trust in Su Ping. Even when delivering resources, they would at most ask a couple of questions.\nBut today was evidently different. The second Wanmu Wolf had appeared.\n「Without a doubt, pandemonium erupted inside the Forest Wolf Troop’s base a hundred kilometers away!」",

      "content": "Chapter 154: Chapter 123: Is this evolved form so fierce?\nThe War Wolf C Division Command Center.\nIn Chief Lin Lei’s office.\nChief Lin still sat behind his desk, listening as one of his battalion commanders reported on the progress and achievements of the past month or so.\n\"Sir, the Evolution of the Desert Wind Wolf has been completed, only...\"\n\"Only what?\" Lin Lei gave the man a look.\nIn a certain sense, a few battalions in War Wolf C Division were always at the bottom. Forest Wolf, Sand Wolf, and Snow Wolf were unquestionably these bottom-ranking battalions.\nThe man standing before him was Wang Feng, the battalion commander of the Sand Wolf Battalion.\n\"Sir, there’s only a little over half a month left until the martial competition begins! I can’t seem to book any joint internal training sessions with our brother battalions. Old Yang’s Snow Wolf Group has already started training with the Instructor’s Shadow Wolf Group. I had hoped to find Lao Zhang, but he said his Forest Wolf Troop hasn’t finished its Cultivation yet...\"\nLin Lei glanced at the man. \"Indeed, his troop hasn’t finished its Cultivation. Why don’t you make arrangements with a few other battalions, or perhaps arrange some cross-training? There’s still half a month left; what’s the rush to train for combat? Let me tell you, if you disgrace me in front of the entire Legion this time, I’ll have you learn postnatal care for sows!\"\nWang Feng was not the least bit concerned by Lin Lei’s threat. Instead, his eyes darted about, and he chuckled. \"Sir, I heard that Lao Zhang’s Forest Wolf Troop has cultivated something remarkable?\"\nLin Lei’s expression remained unchanged as he took a sip of water. \"Where did you hear that?\"\n\"Is it true?\" Wang Feng’s eyes widened.\n\"True or false, what damn business is it of yours? Get back to your training, now!\" Lin Lei said impatiently.\nSeeing the Chief getting angry, Wang Feng fell silent awkwardly, though he didn’t dare retort. Just as he reached the door, Lin Lei’s voice came from behind. \"I don’t care where you heard about this, but let me tell you: watch your mouth! It’s one thing to spread rumors within our division. But if word gets out to other divisions, I’ll be the first to come looking for you!\"\nWang Feng was startled, then his expression turned bitter.\nCould it be true?! Where did that bastard Zhang Lie find such a Breeder?\nFor a moment, Wang Feng was truly itching to know more, but he dared not ask further. However, just as he was about to open the door, it was suddenly pushed open from outside.\n\"Sir! It’s done, the Cultivation is complete...\" Zhang Lie’s voice trailed off.\nHe saw Wang Feng, whose face was brimming with eager curiosity.\n\"Commander Zhang, what’s completed?\" Wang Feng asked, winking.\nWang Feng was startled by Chief Lin’s furious voice from inside the office. \"Damn it, don’t you know to announce yourself before entering? And you, if there’s nothing else, get lost!\"\nRegret welled up inside Wang Feng, but he quickly stood at attention. \"Yes, sir.\"\nFinally, with no outsiders left in the office, Lin Lei spoke. \"Alright, what’s going on? Tell me.\"\nZhang Lie immediately became excited again. \"Sir! Chai Xiaowei’s Forest Wolf has successfully evolved! He himself has directly broken through from Commander First Stage to Commander Second Stage!\"\nLin Lei was stunned. \"That company commander of yours?\"\n\"Yes!\"\nSeeing Zhang Lie’s excited demeanor, Lin Lei suddenly thought of something. \"So, you came because...\"\nZhang Lie chuckled. \"The other brats couldn’t wait either. Since the competition starts in just over half a month, we can’t get much training done within our troop. I was thinking about taking them over there to see and join in the training. Is that okay?\"\nKnowing that one’s own Pet Beast had completed its Evolution, yet being unable to be by its side, was an undeniable and immense torment! Furthermore, Zhang Lie wanted to see for himself what his ace soldiers’ Pet Beasts had become.\nWatching Zhang Lie’s excitement, Lin Lei opened his mouth. He almost wanted to report to General Zhao and ask if he too could go see it.\nWould that be alright? Of course! A brand new, never-before-seen Evolutionary Body! And one with Monarch-level species’ Racial Potential! Who wouldn’t want to see that?\nUnfortunately, given his status and position, he couldn’t simply leave the Legion base.\nHowever, what Zhang Lie said did make some sense. Cultivation was one aspect. During the martial competition, it wouldn’t just be the Pet Beasts entering the field, but also their Beast Tamers. The Pet Beasts and Beast Tamers needed to synergize to achieve even greater effects.\nThinking of this, Lin Lei didn’t mince words and said directly, \"Fine. However, they can stay there. As for you, return to me immediately after you’ve delivered them! And don’t forget to write me a 10,000-word self-criticism!\"\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n「Soon, under the bright midday sun, a military vehicle swiftly departed the Legion base.」\nNo one in the vehicle spoke. The ten soldiers whose Pet Beasts were being cultivated were filled with a mix of excitement and nervousness. They all pursed their lips, their tanned faces unable to conceal their irrepressible joy and anticipation.\nSeeing them made Zhang Lie grit his teeth. \"Damn it! Once we get there, all of you better keep your composure! I’m telling you, you are elite soldiers of the Forest Wolf Troop! Don’t act like unsophisticated mutts who’ve never seen anything! Understood?\"\n\"Yes, sir!\"\n「Time passed slowly.」\nSu Ping, having finished lunch and burped contentedly, didn’t rest. He brought Xiao Qiang and Old Sha, along with over ten elite Forest Wolves, to the combat arena.\nAfter merging with Yun Tian, Su Ping could finally conduct Pet Beast battles without any reservations. With a dedicated combat arena, they could safely use their Skills and unleash their full power, no longer needing to worry about damaging the ecological environment of their Forest Wolf woods.\nIn the open-air venue, basking in the sunlight, Old Sha and Xiao Qiang both squinted their eyes in sheer enjoyment.\nBut Su Ping spoke up. \"Alright, Xiao Qiang!\"\n\"AWOO! (Here!)\"\nThe Forest Wolves from the Legion reacted swiftly to the roll call, which greatly satisfied Su Ping.\n\"Next, I’m going to test your combat capabilities!\"\n\"AWOO! (Yes!)\"\nAt this moment, Xiao Qiang had already assumed the form of the Wanmu Wolf. The green, horn-like antlers on its head swayed slightly as it awaited Su Ping’s further instructions.\n\"First, you’ll face these dozen or so Elite Forest Wolves. However, your goal isn’t to defeat them. If you can’t overpower them quickly, then my Cultivation of your Evolution would be a failure. So, your task is to control them for ten seconds, then release them. Wait for them to attack you again, and then see if you can wear them down until they completely lose all combat power!\"\nThis was a rather unique battle method. However, it was a very useful combat training method. It allowed for the maximum observation of Xiao Qiang’s sustained combat power and trained an even more important aspect: mental fortitude.\nSu Ping then looked at the summoned Wolf Pack. \"And you all, your job is to attack it relentlessly. Understood?\"\n\"AWOO!\"\n\"Good, go ahead!\"\nBoth sides stepped onto the training field together.\n「Meanwhile, a military vehicle had stopped at the entrance of the Heart of Woods.」\nLao Guan, seeing Zhang Lie arrive, smiled and said, \"Xiao Ping is in the combat arena over there, training the evolved Forest Wolf. Commander Zhang, you and your men, please follow me.\"\nZhang Lie nodded. The ten Legion Soldiers behind him were all keenly focused. One of them was so excited he involuntarily held his breath after boarding the sightseeing vehicle with Lao Guan.\nHe was Chai Xiaowei, Xiao Qiang’s current Beast Tamer. It was he who had sensed the changes in Xiao Qiang through their Soul Contract, even experiencing a direct boost of a minor Level himself!\nZhang Lie, seeing this soldier’s dazed expression, smiled and said, \"Alright, I’ve seen the Wanmu Wolf before, so I have some understanding of it. The Wanmu Wolf’s Abilities lean more towards battlefield control and creating forest terrain, which Forest Wolves excel in. Its individual combat prowess might not be that strong. It’s primarily more formidable when fighting in coordination with others.\"\nHe had indeed seen it; after all, he was the first witness to Old Sha’s Evolution.\nSaying this, they all disembarked from the vehicle and followed Lao Guan into the combat arena Su Ping had reserved.\nThe venue was extremely deserted. Although open-air, it was only open from above; a circular wall enclosed its perimeter. However, just as they stepped inside, a series of whistling sounds reached their ears.\nZhang Lie immediately spotted Su Ping standing by the fence. But at that moment, his gaze slowly shifted towards the training field.\nThe vast arena, normally a relatively open training field, was now densely packed. Trees! It was entirely filled with trees, roots, branches, and leaves!\nIf not for the walls and fences around the combat arena, Zhang Lie would have thought it was a small forest. But clearly, this wasn’t a normal forest. A natural forest wouldn’t be this abnormally dense. These trees were packed and squeezed together, looking less like a potted plant arrangement and more like a patch of weeds magnified a thousandfold.\nThen, in the next moment, he saw a figure strolling leisurely outside this ’forest’ on the training field. It was draped in branches that seemed to flow down from its body, resembling a peculiar Old Wolf wearing a straw rain cape. However, the emerald-green, Y-shaped antlers on its head were reminiscent of the legendary auspicious Divine Beast: the Kylin.\nAt that moment, everyone knew that the peculiar Forest Wolf on the field, resembling a Kylin, was indeed the Wanmu Wolf! It was the very Contracted Beast they had sensed through their soul connection.\nBeside them, Chai Xiaowei’s eyes widened, and he clenched his fists in excitement. However, mindful of his commander’s earlier warning, he dared not make any overly conspicuous movements, merely staring at the scene on the field with thrilled eyes.\nHowever, soon, none of them could remain calm!\nThey then noticed that within the dense thicket of entwined branches and leaves—branches stretching out like dark green pythons—figures were darting up and down. They were all too familiar with these figures. They were ordinary Forest Wolves. There were over a dozen of them! All at the Elite Level.\nYet, these Forest Wolves were scrambling to attack Xiao Qiang on the field. However, the small ’forest’ before them seemed like an insurmountable natural barrier. The branches, moving faster than the wolves, would swiftly bind any wolf that made a move, immobilizing it for about ten seconds before releasing it again.\nIt was like a cat toying with mice, tirelessly watching these struggling little creatures attempt to challenge this Wolf King of the trees in its jungle!\nEven considering the difference between Commander Level and Elite Level, wasn’t this gap a bit too large?\nAt that moment, they finally grasped the true charm and combat power of this Forest Wolf Evolutionary Body.\nInstantly, several soldiers looked at their commander with admiration.\nNo wonder! No wonder our commander was so confident this time and paid such a heavy price for us to undergo this Evolution! Such a powerful Evolutionary Body is truly worthy of the commander’s high regard. And yet, an Evolutionary Body this powerful isn’t considered strong in single combat? Then what kind of creature *would* be considered strong?\nIt was then that Zhang Lie, who had been quiet all this time, watching the leisurely Wanmu Wolf and the dozen-plus Elite Forest Wolves being effortlessly captured, finally couldn’t hold back.\n\"Damn... is this Evolutionary Body really that fierce?!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 155: Chapter 124: The Martial Contest Approaches! Legion Formation Training! Blinding Technique!\nZhang Lie ignored the strange looks from his teammates.\nAt this moment, he had only one thought:\nOutrageous! This is utterly outrageous!\nGenerally speaking, a Commander Level Pet Beast naturally held an absolute advantage over Elite Level ones.\nBut could the advantage truly be this significant?\nHe just watched. For a full ten minutes since they had entered, those Forest Wolves hadn’t even touched Xiao Qiang once. The forests that kept springing up seemed to appear at their feet at any moment. Most importantly, the control and growth rate of these forests were just too fast!\nLogically, the energy consumed in this process should be substantial, right?\nBut!\nSo much time had passed! They had already been inside for ten minutes, and who knew how long Xiao Qiang had been fighting before they even arrived!?\nYet, despite such wide-range and frequent manipulation of the forest, Xiao Qiang showed no signs of energy depletion at all.\nOn the contrary, those Forest Wolves were clearly starting to run out of steam.\nTrapped by the Wanmu Wolf’s Tree Prison and then forced to relentlessly attack once released, they were still running a deficit, even in broad daylight with Sunlight Absorption for replenishment.\nIncomprehensible!\nZhang Lie truly couldn’t understand.\nHe didn’t get how such large-scale terrain-modifying Abilities could consume so little Energy! All he knew was that he hadn’t misjudged the Wanmu Wolf bounding above; it was like a Kylin, a truly magnificent sight! This was the best Forest Wolf Evolutionary Body.\nSu Ping paid no attention to the crowd that had entered; his gaze was firmly fixed on Xiao Qiang above.\nHe understood what was happening even better than Xiao Qiang’s owner did.\nThe reason he had so ostentatiously tested Xiao Qiang’s strength was precisely because of this understanding.\nXiao Qiang’s Sunlight Absorption was only at the Proficient Level.\nThus, the evolved Photosynthesis was also only at the Proficient Level.\nAnd most importantly, after completing the Evolution, Xiao Qiang’s Heart of Woods had also risen to the Proficient Level!\nThese three Skills formed a formulaic iron triangle, creating a continuous synergy within Xiao Qiang.\nIt was simply too difficult to advance to Perfection Level! For Old Sha’s Heart of Woods to reach Perfection Level was not something achievable in a day or two. Thus, this first experimental Evolutionary Body, where the Heart of Woods Level matched the other two Skills, held great research significance.\nIndeed, that was the case.\nAt this very moment, Xiao Qiang’s Energy cycling within its body was much smoother and more natural.\nThe physical strain from extensively using these three linked Skills—similar to how Old Sha had in the Secret Realm—would be minimized.\nHowever, the mental fatigue from rapid Skill usage was still inevitable.\nBut, this was already quite impressive.\nIt also highlighted the power of this Skill formula.\nIt’s a pity that Sunlight Absorption, the source, being only at the Proficient Level, was indeed too low. It couldn’t achieve a qualitative change, making it impossible to further observe the upper limits of this Skill combination.\n「Half an hour later」\nXiao Qiang was still in the arena. Its movements showed hardly any signs of disorder, yet in front of it lay numerous Forest Wolves.\nSome of the Forest Wolves with lower Elite Levels had already fainted.\nEven those at higher Elite Levels, including two at the peak Elite Level, were barely hanging on in this battle.\nIt was almost impossible for them to resist again.\nThis outcome wasn’t entirely unexpected, but the process was certainly awe-inspiring!\nOne against sixteen!\nWanmu Wolf, a complete victory!\n「Two hours later」\nZhang Lie stood at the entrance of the Heart of Woods, a look of reluctance on his face, but he still remarked to Su Ping as he was leaving, \"I was a bit worried before, but now I’m not afraid at all! Breeder Su, these ten rascals will stay with you for now. Don’t hesitate to order them around as you see fit! If any of them dare to act up, call me, and I’ll skin ’em when I get back!\"\nZhang Lie glared fiercely at the ten people behind Su Ping.\nNot a single one of the Beast Tamer soldiers denied it. In fact, one who had a good relationship with Zhang Lie even spoke up directly, \"Commander, you don’t even have to say it. If anyone dares to disrespect Breeder Su, we brothers will beat the living crap out of him!\"\nTo be honest, Zhang Lie absolutely believed him.\nIn this whole world, who else could cultivate a Pet Beast like the Wanmu Wolf? Was this Su Ping before him just some young kid? No, he was the guide to their bright future!\nZhang Lie shot them a look. \"You rascals got lucky this time! So, in the Legion competition half a month from now, if anyone dares to mess up, you’ll all suffer five times the punishment I get from the Division Commander!\"\n\"Yes! Guaranteed to complete the mission!\"\nAfter receiving a satisfactory response, Zhang Lie finally turned to Su Ping and said with heartfelt sincerity, \"Breeder Su, sorry to trouble you. Any expenses these rascals incur here will be fully reimbursed by the Forest Wolf Troop! We absolutely won’t let you waste a single cent of your money.\"\nSu Ping smiled and shook his head, \"Commander Zhang, you’re being too distant.\"\nLet alone the Forest Wolf Troop offering reimbursement, Su Ping himself was eagerly awaiting the arrival of these ten Legion Beast Tamers!",

      "content": "Chapter 156: Chapter 124: The Martial Contest Approaches! Legion Formation Training! Blinding Technique!_2\nThe reason was simple: among these ten individuals, the one with the lowest military rank was already a company commander, in charge of around two hundred people and Pet Beasts. The rest were either battalion commanders or elite non-commissioned officers, all of whom had extensive experience in group combat.\nIf Su Ping wanted to command a horde of beasts in battle in the future, he was more than eager to discuss this with the Beast Tamers within the Legion! That’s what he thought, and that’s what he did.\nAt first, these ten Beast Tamer soldiers were indeed very cautious. The reason was simple: Su Ping didn’t make the best first impression on them. The first time he came to summon Pet Beasts, he was anything but polite. After summoning them, he simply told them to beat it.\nHowever, after this interaction, they found that Su Ping, despite his exceptional talent, wasn’t as odd-tempered as they had thought.\n\"A horde? A Legion? Breeder Su’s ideas are quite bold!\"\nThat evening, sitting on the grass in the Forest Wolf woodland, one of the soldiers, the oldest and a thirty-year-old Beast Tamer named Li Da, spoke up in surprise.\n\"That is the idea,\" Su Ping said. \"I am sentimental about Pet Beasts I have raised from youth, so I’m reluctant to sell them. I figured, though arena combat might be out, for exploring Secret Realms and defending against Ferocious Beasts, I could still employ some.\"\nThe others were also surprised. They knew that in the Beast Tamer Legion, Pet Beasts collaborated in combat under the command of Beast Tamers, who themselves followed orders from superior officers.\nBut if one person were to command a Legion’s worth of Pet Beasts? Not to mention two hundred Pet Beasts from a company, even managing thirty to fifty Pet Beasts from a platoon would be difficult, wouldn’t it?\nThey were surprised but didn’t discuss this further. Li Da nodded and said, \"I believe Breeder Su can do the impossible.\"\nAfter a little flattery, he made his suggestion, \"If that’s the case, then I suggest, Breeder Su, you shouldn’t command them all at once in battle. That would surely lead to mistakes. You should primarily engage with a few highly-talented Forest Wolves, get them used to your commands, and make them understand your commands.\n\"Then, use these Forest Wolves as the core to build combat squads! Let these core Forest Wolves command the others. This will be more efficient, and it’s best to conduct tactical-focused training so they get used to their roles!\"\nUpon hearing this, Sun Xiao, a soldier standing next to him, laughed, \"Isn’t this just like the training methods of our Legion’s companies and platoons? Breeder Su, you don’t need to ask Commander Li. He’s all talk, but I’m the one with the real combat experience!\n\"If you trust me, leave it to me. I can’t promise miracles, but I can develop a set of guidelines for you during this time. You just train them according to these methods, as long as you can command each ’Forest Wolf squad leader’!\"\n\"And me! Breeder Su, I’m the instructor of the assault company, responsible for the company’s Pet Beast assault training...\"\n\"I can help as well...\"\nWatching hands rise one after the other, Su Ping smiled.\nWho in this world understood Legion combat better than the members of the Beast Tamer Legion? Who knew better how to ensure that a group of Pet Beasts performed effectively in large-scale warfare? Clearly, no one! So, I really only need to train according to the methods of these most endearing individuals.\nAs for their concerns about whether uncontracted Forest Wolves would understand my commands? Clearly, there was no need for concern. The soul sight ability bestowed by the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas was my most reliable skill. It seemed that after completing this Cultivation task, in the future, I could continue my collaboration with the Beast Tamer Legion. Besides, just having these Beast Tamers from the Legion help oversee the Forest Wolves’ combat training was already a huge help to me.\nThis also allowed Su Ping to devote more energy to the further Cultivation of Forest Wolves and Papermen.\nIndeed, that’s what happened. This peaceful lifestyle continued for two more days. During that time, including the previously advanced ’Dumb’ and ’Dazed’, a total of eight Forest Wolves that had reached Master Level in Sunlight Absorption also finally upgraded their Photosynthesis skill to Mastery Level. This marked the beginning of the third phase in the Cultivation of Forest Wolves.\nAccumulating power, preparing to evolve!\nAt this stage, Su Ping didn’t have to worry too much. By now, of the ten Forest Wolves, only Li Da’s had yet to complete this skill level Cultivation. It couldn’t be helped. That Forest Wolf, like Old Sha’s, had reached Perfection Level in Sunlight Absorption. To upgrade its Photosynthesis, it needed to stabilize first before consuming another Sun Crystal.\nAlthough I now have several Sun Crystals that can be reused, I can’t waste them, can I? After all, my own Forest Wolves might need them in the future. Saving one means earning tens of millions. Where else could I find such a deal normally?\nHowever, Su Ping and Li Da didn’t have to wait too long. After two more days, once it had consumed a Sun Crystal, Li Da’s Forest Wolf, ’Da Zhuang’—which had already achieved Perfection in Sunlight Absorption—also reached Perfection in Photosynthesis. It then began accumulating power in preparation for Evolution.",

Blinding Technique!_3\nApart from these Forest Wolves being bred, what caught Su Ping’s attention the most was undoubtedly the Paperman.\nThe progress of the Paperman also brought joy to Su Ping.\nQian Yi had to be evolved as soon as possible.\nTherefore, the twenty-two Papermen, seven Paper Sword Forms, and the small Paperman Qian Yi were training themselves day and night without rest.\nThe results were extraordinary!\nSix Papermen, with unlimited supplies of resources like Soul-Settling Paper and Undead Crystals in this period, soared from the common Third Rank they were at when first purchased, much like rockets, all the way up to the common Seventh Rank.\nThe upgrading of their skill levels was the same.\nThe Paperman’s Racial Potential was low, their Skills were few, and even their self-awareness wasn’t high.\nBut there was also a benefit to this.\nThat is, they could focus more.\nThey were more single-minded.\nAs Su Ping had the small Paperman Qian Yi practice swordsmanship while supervising the other Papermen in performing ’joint’ and ’disjoint’ exercises, several Papermen advanced their ’Paper Body Joint’ skill from just learning it to the Mastery Level in less than a month.\nSu Ping figured that the shared learning effect was certainly one aspect, but it also indicated that the difficulty of upgrading the Paperman’s ’Paper Body Joint’ skill really wasn’t high! In a way, it was even effortless. Such Skills were indeed easier to improve.\nHowever, what truly excited Su Ping was that three days later, the small Paperman Qian Yi’s mutated ’Paper Body Control’ skill, after a great deal of effort, had finally advanced from the Beginner to the Proficient Level!\nUnlike the Paper Body Joint skill of the ordinary Paperman, which showed no noticeable change in appearance, the improvement in Qian Yi’s Paper Body Control was extremely evident.\nThis fact became clear when it could even remotely control Paper Swords around thirty centimeters from its body, showing how significant this skill level upgrade was for the small Paperman.\nUnfortunately, while the breeding of the Pet Beasts was going strong, the construction of the Heart of Woods hadn’t made much progress over these days.\nThe reason was nothing else but the familiar problem of being out of money again.\nSome construction team expenses could be put on credit.\nBut the special materials required for building bridges could not be deferred, resulting in a temporary halt to the work.\nIf Su Ping didn’t have some expectations for evolving the Crown Wolf Emperor, he would have even considered selling the natural essence in his hands.\nThe resources from the Legion had a special marking, making them difficult to sell, but the origin of the natural essence was clean.\nIt’s a pity. How could Su Ping not have expectations when Miss Qin was evolving the Crown Wolf Emperor? Money could be earned, but resources like these were really hard to come by.\nHowever, Su Ping was determined to put the development of new industries around the Heart of Woods and the training of new Breeders on his agenda when he had the time.\nBesides, after the Beast Tamer warriors led by Li Da arrived, Su Ping finally had time to properly meditate and solidify his skills. In the days that followed, he successfully broke through to become an Elite Third Rank Beast Tamer.\nOf course, there was an even more important matter at hand.\nThe Forest Wolves bred by the Legion were nearly finishing their Evolution one by one.\nOver these few days, the eight wolves who had reached the Master Level of drawing from the sunlight had also finally completed their Evolution.\nThey became the third to the tenth Wanmu Wolves in the world!\nThis provided Su Ping with over 500 experience points. However, putting that aside, the most important development concerned the Forest Wolf ’Er Zhuang,’ who was already at the Commander Level.\nAfter evolving, a dazzling sunlight brilliance burst from its body.\nIts fur color was a bit more golden than the other Wanmu Wolves.\nThe reason was that Su Ping, using his Eye of Truth, clearly saw an Ability in Er Zhuang’s evolved skill list that no other Wanmu Wolf possessed: ’Blinding Technique!’\n「At the same time, there were less than ten days left until the Legion’s big competition.」",

      "content": "Chapter 158: Chapter 125 Going to the Legion! Who is Forest Wolf’s Breeder?\n[Blinding Technique (Beginner): Channels the light of the sun; the intense brightness greatly affects the enemy’s vision! This is a Skill representing a preliminary application of the Power of the Sun.]\nThis was the Skill description for Blinding Technique.\nActually, it looked quite simple, and its effect was even rather ordinary.\nThrough Su Ping’s tests, this Blinding Technique would cause the Wanmu Wolf’s body to burst forth with a brilliance even more dazzling than staring directly at the sun, temporarily blinding an opponent if they were looking directly at it.\nHowever, such Skills had severe limitations and constraints.\nFirst, it was useless against Plant Type creatures. They might even be delighted by it, attacking with even greater vigor.\nSecondly, Su Ping didn’t know its effect on Elemental Types or Undead Types, but it also didn’t have much impact on Papermen. At most, due to Attribute resistance, the Papermen might feel some aversion, but it wouldn’t cause any substantial harm.\nFinally, if an enemy took precautions by simply closing their eyes or turning away, the effect would still be greatly diminished.\nOf course, if the enemy closed their eyes or turned away, perhaps the Blinding Technique would have achieved its effect and purpose after all?\nBut Su Ping didn’t overlook the Skill in the slightest. A Breeder’s intuition told him that this difficult-to-awaken Wanmu Wolf Racial Skill could have numerous connections and be of immense significance.\nBecause Su Ping glanced again at the Illustrated Handbook entry for the Wanmu Wolf that he had looked at countless times:\n[Wanmu Wolf Evolutionary Form: Forest Wolf, an advancement based on the Wood Element Attribute and a preliminary control over the Power of the Sun and further natural plant powers. Possessing great potential for growth and future development, it is one of the top Evolution choices for a Forest Wolf.]\nIn the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, it was even specifically highlighted: \"preliminary control over the Power of the Sun!\"\nSu Ping’s intuition told him that compared to previous Skills like Tree Prison or Life Magnetic Field, or even the mutated Wood Body, perhaps none was as significant as the Blinding Technique. The other Skills increased the Wanmu Wolf’s combat capabilities. But the significance of the Blinding Technique itself was very likely related to the Wanmu Wolf’s further Evolution!\nIs the path of further Evolution also related to sunlight?\nSu Ping suppressed this question in his heart; now was not the time to research and consider these things. Time was incredibly tight! Less than ten days remained before the Legion tournament would begin.\nAnd Da Zhuang was still accumulating Energy. It wasn’t that Su Ping’s time calculation was off; it was just that the heavens hadn’t been very cooperative these past two months. Even though it was autumn, the sunlight had been less abundant than before, causing the accumulated Power of the Sun to be too scarce and slowing down the Forest Wolf’s Evolution.\nThis also served as a lesson, making Su Ping realize even more clearly how immense the Wanmu Wolf’s demand for sunlight was for its Evolution.\nLuckily, it was a close call but without any real danger!\n「Two days later,」\nAfter Su Ping also fed the prepared Elf Leaves and a Golden Oak Fruit to ’Da Zhuang,’ Da Zhuang’s Evolution finally began in an orderly manner.\n「Thus, within fifty days.」\nAll ten of the Legion’s Forest Wolves completed their Evolution from Forest Wolf to Wanmu Wolf! Not a single one failed; at most, their potential varied.\nFurthermore, besides completing their Evolution, all the Forest Wolves were equipped with the Wood Heart Skill.\nEven Er Zhuang’s Heart of Woods Level, just like Old Sha’s, became the only one among the ten Wanmu Wolves to reach the Master Level for an Evolutionary Body. Er Zhuang’s Heart of Woods, along with its Sunlight Absorption and Photosynthesis, all reached the same Skill Level.\nAnd Su Ping’s prediction was indeed correct! Uniformity in the three Skill Levels proved more effective. This was even more so than in cases like Da Zhuang’s, where Sunlight Absorption and Photosynthesis reached Perfection, but Heart of Woods was only at the Proficient Level, making combat handling smoother.\nDa Zhuang’s Level was one rank higher than Old Sha’s, directly reaching Commandant Ninth Rank after completing Evolution. Er Zhuang, on the other hand, was only at Commander Seventh Rank. However, in sustained, arduous battles, Er Zhuang could even gain the upper hand.\nThis once again proved that as long as the difference in Level wasn’t too great, improvements in Skill Level had a greater impact on combat power.\nEr Zhuang’s three Skills formed a perfect chain, like a fully cleared pipeline, continuously converting sunlight into power, making Er Zhuang’s strength seem almost inexhaustible.\nHowever, to Su Ping’s slight disappointment, even though the trio of Skills at the Master Level were indeed somewhat better than before, the further qualitative change he had hoped to see still hadn’t occurred. This made Su Ping begin to doubt whether his formulas and conjectures were correct.\nBut clearly, this was still not something to dwell on at the moment.\nSu Ping didn’t become idle just because the Wanmu Wolves had completed their Evolution. His following days became even busier.\nHe was so busy, in fact, that he had to apologize to some clients for whom he had scheduled or tentatively booked Heart of Woods Cultivation sessions, telling them he would get back to them in a few days.\nThe Wanmu Wolves had one final step: ensuring seven days of activity. He had to guarantee that this last critical phase was absolutely foolproof. Undoubtedly, the Beast Tamer Legion’s tournament was far more important right now than earning this bit of money.",

      "content": "Chapter 159: Chapter 125 Going to the Legion! Who is Forest Wolf’s Breeder?_2\nThe closer the day approached, the more Su Ping’s attention centered on the upcoming event, a focus particularly emphasized by Zhang Lie’s constant calls over the past two days.\nFinally, only two days remained of the two-month timeline.\n\"Mission accomplished!\"\nSu Ping smiled wearily at the arriving Zhang Lie.\nZhang Lie’s eyes narrowed slightly as he observed the ten figures in the woods.\nCommandant Ninth Rank, Commander Seventh Rank, three Commander Sixth Orders, one Commander Fifth Stage, three Commander Fourth Orders, and one Commander Third Rank!\nThese were the ten figures arrayed before him. Merely standing behind the young man, they seemed like an impenetrable bulwark before an endless, wild forest, its verdant foliage concealing untold dangers.\nWere these the same ten Forest Wolves he knew?\nNo!\nThese were the Wanmu Wolves!\nBecause next to these ten Wanmu Wolves stood their respective Beast Tamers.\nSu Ping hadn’t been idle during this time, and neither had they. But it had all been worth it!\nZhang Lie said nothing, not voicing a single doubt. He simply saluted the young man before him, who was about the same age as his own son.\n\"Breeder Su, we set off tomorrow. Commander Zhao and Chief Lin have invited you to attend and observe the upcoming military competition. Do you accept?\"\nAs Zhang Lie had anticipated, Su Ping nodded. \"How many days will the competition last?\" he asked.\n\"It officially starts the day after tomorrow, but we need to return to the Corps base tomorrow to prepare. The competition itself will last about two days!\"\n\"Good! I’ll get ready tonight and leave with you all tomorrow.\"\nHe was finally going to the Corps base!\nA faint thrill of excitement stirred in Su Ping’s heart.\nThat wasn’t a place just anyone could visit!\nInfluenced by his father, Su Ping harbored both a longing for and curiosity about the Beast Tamer Corps. And with their departure set for tomorrow, how could Su Ping not be excited?\nDuring dinner, he mentioned his plans to Lao Guan. Lao Guan nodded, telling Su Ping to be careful while he was away and that he would handle everything at home.\nSince the drowning incident, Lao Guan hadn’t brought up the matter of cultivating a Heart of Woods for Guan Lili again. Lao Guan hadn’t even pursued the compensation from the family involved in the drowning.\nSu Ping knew Lao Guan didn’t want to cause him any trouble. That couple’s humility was due to Dong Muyun. However, Su Ping didn’t know much about the precise nature of the relationship between Dong Muyun, the former chairman, and himself. If he accepted a favor from them, some things might become complicated later on.\nLao Guan had been diligent for many years and was naturally unwilling to let greed create potential problems or hidden dangers for Su Ping and the Heart of Woods.\nSu Ping saw all of this clearly and understood Uncle Guan’s intentions. However, Su Ping didn’t say anything more about it.\nHe could discuss it after the military competition was over and he returned.\nBy then, he could offer both reassurance and a generous gift to this diligent Manager Guan.\n「 」\nWhen night fell, Su Ping returned to his room and lay on his bed. Before he could enter a state of meditation, his phone rang again.\nSu Ping initially thought it was Qin Xiaoxue, as Miss Qin had indeed been calling quite frequently these past few days. However, the caller ID took him by surprise.\nIt was his father, who hadn’t contacted him since they last parted ways.\n\"Hello?\"\n\"Son, have you missed me?\"\n\"If you have something to say, just get to the point.\"\n\"Tsk, I was just thinking about the upcoming military competition in Jianghai Province. Have your preparations been completed? Your old man here has been bragging about you. Are you confident?\"\nAs Su Ping had figured, his father, having discussed it with Zhang Lie previously, naturally remembered the event.\nSu Ping replied with a slight snort, \"It’s in the bag!\"\nFacing Su Anyong, Su Ping’s confidence was palpable.\n\"I’ve witnessed Old Sha’s capabilities myself,\" Su Anyong said. \"Unless your luck is terrible, or the competition rules or terrain are completely ridiculous, breaking into the top five shouldn’t be an issue!\"\nThis time, Su Anyong wasn’t being stubborn.\nYet, Su Ping snorted coldly again. \"Top five? Who are you looking down on? First place! It has to be first place!\" he declared.\n\"You kid, don’t be too arrogant. The networks within the Beast Tamer Corps aren’t as simple as you imagine. You’ve only focused on cultivating one type. I reckon some elite battle groups will feature diverse cultivation strategies! Five-person combat teams can form complementary squads with the same species but different Evolutionary Bodies. Although Wanmu Wolves are versatile, they also have distinct weaknesses!\"\nSu Anyong was indeed right. Putting other attributes aside, the greatest weakness of the Wanmu Wolves, similar to other Wood Element Pet Beasts, was their vulnerability to fire. They were inherently countered by Fire Element Pet Beasts.\nSu Ping, however, didn’t seem concerned. His eyes darted around for a moment before he abruptly asked, \"Dad, you mentioned competition rules. What are they usually like in these Corps competitions? Tell me in detail.\"\nSu Anyong smacked his lips. \"There are many,\" he said. \"The most traditional and widely applied is the one-on-one elimination match, a knockout tournament system decided by drawing lots. However, this format was slightly improved many years ago. It was updated to include terrain selection, and instead of random draws, a challenge-point system was implemented. However, this too was later criticized for lacking practical battlefield applicability. It was seen as too performance-oriented, failing to showcase the full combat capabilities of Beast Tamers and their Pet Beasts in unpredictable wilderness scenarios, as it focused too much on arena-style duels.\"",

Who is Forest Wolf’s Breeder?_3\n\"So, the Legion competitions in recent years have mostly been battle royale style, based on large maps. It’s like throwing competitors into a designated area to ’raise gu’; whoever comes out on top is the badass.\"\n\"Still, this format focuses too much on luck and randomness. All in all, that’s just how it is. I guess the upcoming Legion competition will probably be another battle royale.\"\n\"In situations like that, it’s closest to a real engagement in the wild...\" Su Anyong suddenly stopped mid-sentence, as if a hen had just clutched his throat, and he seemed to realize something.\nAs he seemed to expect, Su Ping’s quiet voice finally came through. \"Su Anyong, you sure know your stuff.\"\nSu Anyong let out an awkward chuckle. \"Hey, didn’t I tell you? I enlisted back in the day and hung around in the Beast Tamer Legion for a few years.\"\n\"Oh, so hanging around for those few years clued you in on the current Legion competition rules?\" Su Ping didn’t believe him.\nSu Anyong continued, \"Can’t I have comrades? What does a little squirt like you know about deep camaraderie?\"\n\"Such deep camaraderie, yet in all these years, I haven’t seen anyone come looking for an old comrade like you for a reunion?\"\nSu Anyong promptly changed the subject. \"Alright, your stepmother’s awake. We’ll talk later. Also, if you really manage to get the Wanmu Wolf to place first in the Legion competition, I’ll bring your stepmother along to deliver a present!\"\n\"Hey, what kind of present—\"\nBEEP. BEEP. BEEP.\nSu Ping curled his lip as he listened to the dial tone.\nThis old geezer is definitely someone special. And there’s a very good chance he is either directly from the Beast Tamer Legion or some kind of official. Of course, maybe he used to be, but Su Ping didn’t know what his situation was now. He couldn’t be bothered to ponder it further; the old man would tell him eventually.\nTossing his phone aside, he started his meditation.\nNow that the cultivation of the Pet Beast was complete, he also needed to earnestly practice meditation to catch up on the Realm he’d fallen behind in.\nAfter all, the professional Beast Tamer assessment Qin Xiaoxue had told him about for next year still weighed on his mind.\n「The night slowly passed.」\n「Come morning, over a hundred kilometers away at the Beast Tamer Legion base.」\nThe most central courtyard of the Forest Wild Army Command Center.\nA special aircraft arrived, and two figures descended from the sky.\nStanding there in military uniform with a beaming smile was Commander Zhao, flanked by a few other commanders who were also grinning at the newcomers. \"President Qin, President Liu,\" Commander Zhao said, his face wreathed in smiles as he saw them arrive, \"you honor our Legion with your guidance. We’ve hardly given you the welcome you deserve, forgive our lapse, forgive our lapse.\"\nThe two arriving figures were none other than Qin Erlong and Liu Fuhai.\nAlthough local and Legion jurisdictions didn’t overlap, for significant events like this competition, it was common to communicate. This competition certainly qualified.\nMoreover, and most importantly, one was the spouse of a key figure from Magic Capital Academy, while the other was a steadfast reformist in the Breeder Association. Both were undoubtedly comrades in the same camp as Old Zhao.\nThis time, the Legion was initiating preliminary reforms, especially concerning elite Pet Beast cultivation, so naturally, these two had been invited to observe.\n\"Hahaha, we’re just here to join the excitement. But you, Old Zhao, you’re making a significant move this time. It looks like *that person* is finally ready to free up their hands and start cleaning house, eh?\" Qin Erlong said this quite openly, not bothering to lower his voice at all. In fact, he even raised it slightly, glancing with a smile at the few other figures who had arrived.\nCommander Zhao naturally understood his meaning.\nDamn, having a powerful wife really means you can say whatever you want, huh? He’s speaking so recklessly!\nLiu Fuhai chimed in, \"Heh, after the reforms of the Breeder Association and the Beast Master Association are complete, the next targets will be the Legion and the education system. Old Zhao, you’re firing the first shot here!\"\nCommander Zhao said, \"Alright, let’s not stand out here in the wind. Let’s go inside.\"\nQin Erlong could speak without reservation, and Liu Fuhai wasn’t afraid either. However, at this major Legion base, the most important military installation in the east, there were some things Commander Zhao definitely couldn’t say publicly.\nThe other commanders, those who were in the same faction and on good terms, came to greet Qin Erlong and Liu Fuhai. The rest departed promptly. Neither Qin Erlong nor Liu Fuhai paid them any mind.\nAmong these people, some were individuals backed by certain prominent Families, while others were those who had lost out due to the recent internal reforms. But in the end, they were all just like a mantis trying to stop a chariot—their efforts were futile.\nThe smooth progression of this outsourced elite cultivation competition was proof of that!\nBack in the command headquarters office, Commander Zhao poured tea for his two guests before saying with a smile, \"The competition officially starts tomorrow. I’m afraid I’ll have to trouble you both to spend the night here.\"\nQin Erlong laughed. \"Cut the crap. You just want Old Liu and me to intimidate those restless elements within the Legion, don’t you?\"\nVice President Liu waved his hand. \"Don’t drag me into this. I’m just here to watch the show. If there’s any fighting to be done, you guys can handle it.\"\nAfter saying this, Vice President Liu quickly asked, \"Old Zhao, let me ask you something.\"\nCommander Zhao nodded. Although Vice President Liu was only at Monarch Peak, and his actual combat prowess as a Beast Tamer was indeed inferior, his status as a Breeder was not to be underestimated. Old Liu was at Monarch Peak, true, but his network of connections was second to none!\nForest Wolves were one of the most common types of Pet Beasts. As one of Dragon Nation’s renowned Forest Wolf Breeders, Old Liu had encountered countless powerful individuals who favored them. Breeders, especially high-level, renowned ones, were formidable for this very reason. Therefore, Commander Zhao didn’t dare to treat Old Liu with anything less than utmost respect.\n\"Ask away!\" Commander Zhao prompted.\n\"This time, will the external Breeders responsible for the outsourced cultivation also be coming to observe the competition?\" Liu Fuhai asked, blinking.\nCommander Zhao nodded. \"Naturally. These are the masterpieces of various Breeders, after all. Our Legion has allocated considerable resources, so we certainly want them to see our sincerity and the results of their own expertise!\"\nLiu Fuhai wasn’t concerned about sincerity. He quickly asked, \"I’ve heard about the Breeders for the Snow Wolf, Sand Wolf, Hunting Wolf, and Shadow Wolf. For the Sand Wolf, Young Yang from our Jianghai Province Breeders Association and I personally supervised part of it. The Snow Wolf is supposedly handled by a Senior Breeder from Beiyuan Province. I’ve also heard bits and pieces about the Hunting Wolf and Shadow Wolf. But what’s the situation with this Forest Wolf?\"\nAlthough Liu Fuhai hadn’t specifically inquired during this period, with such a major event happening in the Legion, Breeders in several neighboring provinces and cities in the eastern region had caught wind of it. Yet, concerning the Forest Wolf Breeder, not a single piece of information had leaked out, from top to bottom.\nLiu Fuhai was puzzled. Normally, such a Breeder should be at least Intermediate Level, if not Advanced Level. Across the entire Dragon Nation, weren’t the most skilled Forest Wolf Breeders located in Jianghai Province and its surrounding areas? Yet, he hadn’t heard a thing.\nCommander Zhao also paused for a moment. Looking at Old Liu, he finally realized something and asked, \"You don’t know?\"\n\"Know what?\" Liu Fuhai looked genuinely clueless.\nHe had indeed been extremely busy lately. He was assisting Yang He with the cultivation of the Desert Wind Wolf (from the Sand Wolf project), accompanying the exchange Breeders from Huaiyang Province, and organizing materials for the Breeder competition scheduled for the end of the year. With the official President of the Breeder Association away, all these responsibilities had fallen onto his shoulders, keeping him incredibly busy.\nScratching his head, Commander Zhao finally understood why the old fellow had spoken as he did earlier. \"The Breeder for this Forest Wolf Troop is from your Jianghai Province. And it seems they’re from Linzhou City, too.\"\n\"Ah?\" Liu Fuhai raised an eyebrow.\nMeanwhile, Qin Erlong, who was standing to the side, seemed to have thought of something, a flicker of understanding in his eyes.\nOld Zhao didn’t want to elaborate further with Old Liu. After all, he had only glanced at the document himself, and it would be difficult for him to recall one specific name from the dozens listed. So, he said directly, \"How about this: in a little while, later this morning, the Breeders from various locations will be returning to the Legion base with the Pet Beasts whose cultivation is complete. Why don’t you go and see for yourself then? Wouldn’t that solve it?\"\nLiu Fuhai frowned but didn’t object, simply nodding in agreement.\nHowever, Old Liu clearly didn’t notice the teasing glint in Qin Erlong’s eyes, which suggested he had already figured something out.\n「Meanwhile, on the outskirts of Linzhou City, Su Ping had already boarded a vehicle with Zhang Lie and the others, excitedly heading towards the Legion base.」",

      "content": "Chapter 161: Chapter 126: Wanmu Wolf? It’s already completed?\nHaving heard Zhang Lie mention it before, Su Ping had long been prepared.\nHowever, upon actually seeing the military base hidden deep in the mountains, Su Ping was still taken aback.\nIt wasn’t because the military base before him was particularly large. Rather, it was too small!\nAdmittedly, he had anticipated some of this. After all, establishing a military base deep in these inaccessible woods would be extremely difficult, and the location of such a base had to be relatively secret.\nNaturally, it couldn’t be too large or conspicuous, but wasn’t this place a bit *too* small?\nWhat appeared before Su Ping was an area no bigger than a small village, at least from the perspective of the entrance.\nThis was a military base for two armies! One for the Eastern Forest Army, the other for the Eastern Mountain Army! The naval base of the Beast Taming Army was on West Dragon Lake, but for the bases of the two land armies, wasn’t this area a bit too small? Over a hundred thousand Beast Tamers crammed into such a tiny place? To anyone looking, it seemed a bit absurd.\nWith a puzzled expression, Su Ping glanced out the window and then at a smiling Zhang Lie.\n\"Commander Zhang, this is...\"\nThe long-awaited military camp, just like this?\nBeyond his astonishment, Su Ping felt somewhat disappointed.\nHowever, Zhang Lie was beaming.\n\"What’s wrong? Breeder Su, you think it’s too small?\"\nSu Ping nodded.\nSmall? That was an understatement.\nAfter entering through the ’town’s’ gate, Su Ping hardly saw any soldiers. Although there were a few who obviously carried a military aura, he didn’t find any command center within the small town. Instead, he noticed convenience stores, small diners, and places selling daily necessities.\nHe even saw a couple of unmarked small shops, with a few Beast Tamers glancing around furtively before tiptoeing inside.\nWhat the hell kind of military camp was this? A legion’s camp?\nSu Ping felt the glorious image of the Beast Tamer corps in his mind shatter instantly.\nSeeing Su Ping’s obviously mistaken expression, Zhang Lie finally said, \"Strictly speaking, this is just the outer perimeter of the camp. Most of those here are either families from the legions or those who have retired from them. As for that...\"\nZhang Lie, pointing at the few who were tiptoeing stealthily into the unmarked shop, chuckled and said, \"That’s a Pet Beast shop specializing in catnip. Its main customers are those sons of bitches from the Tiger Division. Goddamn it, they sneak out to buy catnip when entry and exit aren’t too strict during the major military competition. If I weren’t with you, Breeder Su, I’d definitely catch a few to hand over to the inspection team.\"\n\"...\"\nZhang Lie’s words made Su Ping glance at the shop in surprise. He didn’t quite understand, but his confusion hadn’t lessened at all.\nOuter perimeter? But the question was, in this small town that one could see across at a glance, where was the inside?\nHis confusion was quickly resolved.\nWhen they reached the rear of the town, near the mountain it backed onto, he witnessed a scene he would never forget for the rest of his life!\nBefore the massive rock face, a multitude of space vortexes shimmered into view—at least twenty of them!\nThese were far grander than the so-called space vortex of the Fengdu Sword King’s Heritage Secret Realm that had once appeared in his own backyard. Every single one of these twenty-plus space vortexes was enormous, each easily dozens of meters wide.\nAmong them, two were particularly huge. The entire rock face was consumed by these space vortexes!\n\"This is...\"\nZhang Lie was very satisfied with Su Ping’s shock and chuckled, \"The military command here is a combined arms army group formed by two large land armies. It’s also one of the most important military regions in the East. Its actual location is an absolute secret, so stabilized space vortexes are used for secure, linked transportation.\"\nAs he spoke, the vehicle didn’t even slow down, driving straight into one of the space vortexes.\nFaintly visible above that particular space vortex were a few characters: Eastern Forest Army - A Division, B Division Entrance.\nEvidently, each of these space vortexes served as a separate entrance for the various legions within, linking to their respective division-based garrisons.\nSu Ping took a deep breath.\nWhat kind of grand operation was this? Connected by stabilized space vortexes?\nBefore he could ponder further, Zhang Lie extended his wrist, and an electronic, mechanical voice sounded from it again:\n\"Identity confirmed. Forest Wolf Troop leader Zhang Lie of A Division. Entry permitted.\"\nThe vehicle didn’t even stop, entering the swirling portal of space.\nUnlike the disorienting, world-spinning sensation he’d felt when entering the Sword King’s Secret Realm, this time it was as if they had merely passed through a layer of water. The transition was so smooth that Su Ping, despite being prepared, was almost caught off guard.\nThe next moment, the view opened vastly.\nAn endless sky stretched above. Exercise grounds were enclosed by high walls, and wide roads extended in all directions, their ends out of sight.\nThere were sprawling complexes of buildings, and in the distance, the horizon met deep forests and ancient mountains.\nAnd then there were the Beast Tamer soldiers, stationed at numerous sentry posts and atop the high walls.\nThis scene finally matched Su Ping’s image of a true military legion’s encampment.\nAs Su Ping watched, astonished, Zhang Lie had already made a phone call:\n\"Commander, yes! Breeder Su has been delivered! We’ll be at the entrance of your command center in a moment!\"\n\"Great!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 162: Chapter 126: Wanmu Wolf? It’s already completed?_2\nIn the War Wolf A Division command center, Lin Lei stood up from his office and hung up the phone. He glanced at the few people beside him and smiled faintly, \"Gentlemen, the last Breeder of my division has arrived, and they are quite a special one. I’m going out to welcome them; please make yourselves comfortable.\"\nHmm?\nAs soon as these words were spoken, several figures in the room looked at Chief Lin with surprise. Who could this person be, whose arrival warranted such personal attention from Chief Lin?\nIt was worth noting that among those present were even Senior Breeders, particularly the Snow Wolf Breeder from Beiyuan Province. The woman in black beside this Breeder was also quite a prominent figure in Beiyuan Province. However, even when this prominent figure had arrived the previous day, Chief Lin hadn’t greeted her with such fanfare—admittedly due to official duties. Nevertheless, this was enough to illustrate the high regard in which Chief Lin held the Breeder who was now arriving.\nWithin the War Wolf Division, there were six Wolf Troops: Forest Wolf, Hunting Wolf, Shadow Wolf, Snow Wolf, Sand Wolf, and Flame Wolf. These six types of Wolf Pets all shared one common trait: their Racial Potential typically reached the Elite Peak. This was also what the Legion considered the most suitable basic Pet Beasts for regiment-level main forces. Of course, the War Wolf Division had other units as well. For instance, the Thunder Wolf Company and the Moon Wolf Company existed as companies directly under the division. They were considered high-end forces of the War Wolf Division and were not counted among the regiment-level formations.\nIndeed, the individuals present were the Breeders from the other five Wolf Troops.\nImmediately, one person mused aloud, \"The last to arrive must be for Chief Lin’s Forest Wolf Troop, right? Jianghai Province is the birthplace of Forest Wolves. I wonder if this Forest Wolf Breeder is from Jianghai Province?\"\nAs he spoke, he glanced sidelong at a nearby figure, a hint of teasing amusement in his eyes.\nYang He’s expression shifted slightly. This was Yang He. Sun Chaoju had emphatically introduced him to Su Ping back when Su Ping attended classes at the Breeder Association. He was a specialist Breeder of Sand Wolves, having mastered not just one, but several types of Skill Cultivation. He had even mastered quite a few of the publicly popular Evolution paths for Sand Wolves, making him one of the top Intermediate Breeders in Jianghai Province. Moreover, he wasn’t just proficient with Sand Wolves; he had also mastered the Cultivation of several varieties of Populus-type Plant-based Pet Beasts. Compared to Sun Chaoju, this man was truly Vice President Liu’s favorite protégé. Otherwise, Yang He wouldn’t have been able to take on the Cultivation task for the Sand Wolf Troop this time; even Liu Fuhai had personally overseen the work, cultivating an exceptional Evolutionary Body among Sand Wolves—the Desert Wind Wolf.\nHowever, the words just spoken seemed to carry an underlying implication.\nThe speaker was the Breeder from the Flame Wolf Group, one of only two Senior Breeders present. However, unlike the Snow Wolf Breeder from Beiyuan Province who was merely visiting Jianghai, this Flame Wolf Breeder named Ding Yan had some past connections with the Jianghai Province Breeders Association. Ding Yan had originally been a Breeder with the Jianghai Province Breeders Association. But back then, due to internal strife, issues with resource allocation, and various other reasons within the association, Ding Yan had left for Huaiyang Province. Two years ago, he had developed the Flame Wolf’s brand-new Evolutionary Body, the ’Ashen Wolf Lord,’ and became a Senior Breeder specializing in Flame Wolves.\nAlthough the Breeders Association had undergone internal reforms, purging many corrupt elements—to the point that the former president of the association had since been staying in the capital city—and the Jianghai Province Breeders Association itself had experienced a major overhaul, this Breeder Ding still harbored a deep-seated prejudice against Breeders from Jianghai.\nHis current words were clearly meant to mock. Everyone knew that even though Jianghai Province was the birthplace of Forest Wolf Cultivation, the proficiency of its specialized Forest Wolf Breeders was, frankly, mediocre. For many years, apart from the outdated Forest Wolf and Elf Wolf Evolutionary Bodies that had emerged a decade prior, there had been no significant progress.\nAlthough this newly arriving Breeder was clearly valued by Chief Lin, it was precisely this fact that made Ding Yan believe the person couldn’t be a Forest Wolf Breeder from Jianghai Province.\nHowever, before Yang He could speak, the standing Lin Lei smiled and said, \"Breeder Ding guessed correctly. Indeed, the Forest Wolf specialist Breeder who has arrived is from Jianghai Province!\"\nUpon hearing Lin Lei’s words, Ding Yan’s expression darkened slightly. The intelligence he had gathered indicated that Jianghai Province had made no progress in Forest Wolf Cultivation over the past few years.\nMeanwhile, Yang He was taken aback.\nHmm? A Forest Wolf Breeder from Jianghai Province?\nHe blinked.\nHe had been in Linzhou for the past two months. If it were a Breeder from Jianghai, wouldn’t his teacher have told him? But, from what he knew, hadn’t Old Sun and Old Yang both been eliminated?\nWhen his teacher had mentioned this matter, he had complained about those two for several days.\nYang He did know of one other Intermediate Forest Wolf Breeder in Jianghai Province—that Su Ping he had met last time.\nBut that couldn’t be possible. That Su Ping had only just managed to cultivate the so-called ’Heart of Wood’ not long ago. He was a promising young Breeder, and Yang He was more than willing to befriend him. But at such a young age, he couldn’t have mastered the Cultivation of both the Forest Wolf and the Elf Wolf, could he?",

Does Jianghai City have a hidden, specialized Forest Wolf Breeder that I’m unaware of? Still, it’s obvious this isn’t the time to dwell on it.\nAfter Chief Lin finished speaking, he wasted no more words and walked straight out of the office to wait at the entrance of the command center.\nBefore long, a car slowly approached from nearby.\nSeveral figures leaped out of the car.\n\"Report, Commander, Breeder Su has been delivered!\"\n\"Alright, we’re heading to the military headquarters tomorrow. You all go back and prepare well!\"\n\"Yes, sir!\"\nLin Lei walked right past Zhang Lie and finally saw Su Ping standing there, then burst into laughter, \"Hahahaha, I’ve been longing for the stars and the moon, and finally, Breeder Su is here!\"\nLin Lei was not a particularly burly man, but he gave Su Ping an exaggeratedly enthusiastic hug.\nThis left the somewhat reserved Su Ping slightly stunned.\nIs this Chief Lin being a bit too enthusiastic?\nIndeed, he was being overly enthusiastic. Lin Lei had to be.\nDamn it, the promise that kid’s platoon leader father had extorted from him was something he didn’t even dare mention to the Breeders from other legions. After so much cost and effort, he had finally met the young man in person.\nThe last time Zhang Lie brought people back, he had praised the evolutionary body of the Wanmu Wolf to the skies, making Lin Lei eager with anticipation. Besides, even though that kid’s father was annoying, he was still considered one of their own. So, the kid was naturally considered almost one of them too. And he was such a talented Breeder.\nWho knew if he might need to curry favor with him in the future? What’s wrong with being a bit enthusiastic now?\n\"Chief Lin, you flatter me... Huh?\"\nBefore Su Ping could finish speaking, he saw Yang He standing behind Lin Lei—over Lin Lei’s shoulder as they hugged—looking as if he’d just seen a ghost.\nThe moment he saw the astonishment on Su Ping’s face, Yang He knew his unbelievable suspicion was true.\nDamn it, the scenario I considered the least likely is actually happening right before my eyes. Su Ping?! Is it really Su Ping?\nAlthough he had only met him once, during that class at the Breeder Association, Yang He had deeply etched Su Ping’s appearance into his memory; he couldn’t help but recall it vividly. This was a young Intermediate Level Breeder. His face practically screamed ’young and promising’ and ’bright future,’ as if worried others wouldn’t notice.\nBut no matter how promising or what a bright future he has, this young fellow shouldn’t be here, should he? Could it be that our teacher secretly gave this kid special treatment behind our backs? Did he secretly share the Breeder Association’s cultivation method for the Forest Wolf Evolver with him, free of charge? You know, it’s actually possible.\nThis was because, during this time, whenever Liu Fuhai was cultivating those Desert Wind Wolves with him, he would often talk about Su Ping. He’d say Su Ping was intelligent and exceptionally hardworking, suggesting he might even take over his mantle in the future. He also mentioned that President Qin of the Beast Master Association held Su Ping in high regard. Teacher Liu would even ramble on about what a waste it was, or lament not having a granddaughter, and other things Yang He couldn’t quite understand.\nAlthough I didn’t understand why President Qin valued Su Ping so much, or what any of it had to do with Teacher Liu not having a granddaughter, I knew one thing for sure: Teacher Liu genuinely valued him. However, Teacher Liu had also mentioned that Su Ping was supposedly focused on researching that ’Wanmu Wolf’ evolutionary body Sun Chaoju had developed, hadn’t he? How did he get involved with the legion?\nHowever, no sooner had this question formed in his mind than Yang He’s body stiffened. In disbelief, he stared at Su Ping, whom Lin Lei was gripping tightly.\nSure enough, Chief Lin’s voice rang out again, \"Hahahaha, I’m not exaggerating at all! Old Zhang has praised that ’Wanmu Wolf’ to the heavens, even claiming it’s the most perfect evolutionary body of the Forest Wolf! Naturally, I’m eager to see what kind of cultivation genius could achieve such a feat!\"\nSo it’s true!\nYang He’s pupils contracted sharply.\nThe Wanmu Wolf? This kid has already completed it?",

      "content": "Chapter 164: Chapter 127: Snatching People! Su Ping Becomes a Coveted Prize!\nWhat wolf? The Wanmu Wolf?\nAt this moment, Yang He, after his initial shock, fell into an expected calm.\nBut the other Breeders who had followed to see which Breeder had earned such high regard from Chief Lin were all exchanging glances of confusion upon hearing the name.\nWhat kind of Evolutionary Body was this? A Forest Wolf’s?\nClearly, this must be a brand new, never-before-seen special Evolutionary Body.\nImmediately, some looked fervently at the young Breeder before them. Did they understand Chief Lin to mean that this young man had completed its cultivation? At this moment, they understood.\nDing Yan, well into his forties, had become a prominent figure in Huaiyang Province just three years ago after developing the Flame Wolf from the Ashen Wolf Lord, directly ranking at the top in the Breeder Association of Huaiyang Province. And now this youngster had achieved this at such a young age? Who wouldn’t be astounded by that?\nEven Ding Yan slightly narrowed his eyes, subconsciously pursing his lips. He indeed disliked those guys from the Breeder Associations of Jianghai Province, including this Yang He. But he wouldn’t let regional discrimination affect his view of this impressive young Breeder. Just like the other Breeders, at this moment, they had only one thought: Poaching!\nAn incredible Breeder from Jianghai Province like him... it’s quite clear that Yang He, a core member of the Breeder Association, probably doesn’t know much about this young man. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be unaware that he’s the Forest Wolf Breeder. Even if Yang He knew, even if Su Ping was registered, so what? As long as the benefits offered are enticing enough, they could definitely get this youngster to re-register as a Breeder from their province. Yes, that’s exactly their plan!\nAfter the new leadership came into power, the Dragon Nation’s Beast Master Association and Breeder Association had undergone internal reform. Resource allocation was now entirely based on regional cultivation achievements, and nearly every talent within the associations across the provinces was highly coveted because that concerned the distribution of benefits. This was the main reason for Dragon Nation’s unprecedented national strength in recent years. The nation had also begun to value talent to an unprecedented degree, unlike in the past, where narrow-minded individuals or factions in control would suppress or even steal the achievements of other Breeders.\nIf such incidents occurred now, it would either result in murder to silence the victim, or the perpetrator wouldn’t be saved by mere complaints and reports. Furthermore, if the wronged party directly registered with the Breeder Association of another province, the local organization would face severe repercussions. But murder to silence someone? In this day and age, that was truly not easy. If it were a common person, perhaps someone with great connections like Dong Muyun could suppress it, but a registered Breeder? How could that be easy? The supervisory departments of the Dragon Nation were certainly no joke.\nClearly, at this moment, everyone’s gaze towards Su Ping twinkled with enticement. A Genius Breeder like him... if they managed to poach him, it would be a great achievement, and the internal credit rewards wouldn’t be insignificant. However, the time was not yet ripe; with so many eyes watching, they couldn’t approach him directly.\nYet clearly, at this very moment, Yang He hadn’t realized what was unfolding. He subconsciously pulled out his phone and, head down, sent a message to Teacher Liu, who had brought him here early in the morning: \"Teacher Liu, something big has happened! Do you know?\"\n「...」\nAt the very center of this imposing building complex, in the highest office of the Forest Wild Army’s central command, Liu Fuhai, who was still chatting with Zhao Deguang over tea, frowned slightly. He took out his phone and glanced at it. Old Liu blinked. It was a message from Yang He. This was, in the truest sense, his disciple, and Old Liu held him in high regard. So, upon seeing Yang He’s message, Old Liu was initially puzzled.\nSomething big has happened? What exactly? Hadn’t this rascal come with him to the military camp this morning? Shouldn’t he be with the War Wolf Division’s Chief now, discussing the details for tomorrow’s competition? What could possibly happen within the military camp? Had Eagle Country attacked? Obviously, that’s nonsense. If any foreign country were invading, Old Zhao’s side would be the first to know. So what major incident could occur within this Legion?\nStill, just to be safe, Liu Fuhai replied with a message: \"What big event? What would I know?\"\nAfter putting down his phone, Liu Fuhai didn’t dwell on it, continuing to drink his tea and chat. But to his annoyance, after a long while, his unfortunate disciple still hadn’t replied.\nIt wasn’t that Yang He didn’t reply; it was that Su Ping, having just released Lin Lei from his embrace, immediately greeted him, \"Breeder Yang!? I truly didn’t expect to see you here.\"\nListening to Su Ping’s words, Yang He thought for a moment, shook Su Ping’s hand, and internally complained,\nShouldn’t I be the one saying that?\nHe, Yang He, was a long-established Intermediate Breeder. If he hadn’t been consistently unable to develop a new Evolutionary Body for the Sand Wolf and his other specialty Pet Beasts, he would have advanced to Senior Breeder long ago. Moreover, he was proficient and well-versed in the cultivation and evolution methods for the Desert Wind Wolf, originally researched by his teacher, Liu Fuhai. He also possessed several unique methods for the cultivation and evolution of Sand Wolf Skills.",

Su Ping Becomes a Coveted Prize!_2\nIn both principle and sentiment, it was perfectly reasonable for Yang He to be present here.\nBut where the hell did you pop up from?\nOf course, he wouldn’t voice that out loud and instead asked this eager question, \"That Wanmu Wolf from last time, did you finish it?\"\nDespite Lin Lei and the recently met Zhang Lie both having confirmed it, he still wanted to get a positive answer from Su Ping’s own mouth.\nSu Ping nodded.\nYang He couldn’t wait to ask, \"What Rank of Racial Potential?\"\nSu Ping gave a helpless smile but didn’t rush to answer, which is when Yang He realized. Having the ever-smiling Lin Lei beside him was one thing, but there were also other Breeders present.\nIn fact, Su Ping didn’t even want to tell Yang He.\nDamn it, even though everyone was from Linzhou, this time they were competitors! In the Legion Tournament, combat is conducted by teams representing different legions. Racial Potential is a minor thing in comparison. But if Racial Potential was asked, wouldn’t Racial Skills be next? The key to the Wanmu Wolf lay in the absolute secrecy of its information. Its Skills and such were unknown to the outside world! Under such circumstances, he could catch the Beast Tamers of other legions completely off guard. If he told this guy now, what if this guy turned around and sold him out later? Although it seemed rather paranoid, it was better to be cautious in all matters. After all, he had made quite the boast to his own father.\nYang He too seemed to realize something. He glanced at the people around him, and his eyelid twitched, particularly when he saw the meaningful looks from the Breeders nearby.\nEspecially Ding Yan, who had previously shown great animosity toward Breeders from Linzhou and Jianghai Province, even took the initiative to speak, \"Chief Lin, who is this young man? Please, introduce us.\"\nLin Lei didn’t refuse but simply responded with a chuckle, \"Let’s go back to the office first.\"\nOnce back in the office, Lin Lei began to introduce Su Ping. \"Come, Su Ping, let me introduce you.\"\nHe pointed at Ding Yan, who had been dismissive of Yang He but now wore a pleasant expression toward Su Ping. \"Su Ping, this is Ding Yan. He’s a Senior Breeder from the Huaiyang Breeder Association and also one of its council members, the Flame Wolf Senior Breeder Ding Yan. Three years ago, he discovered and researched the Flame Wolf’s Evolutionary Body, the ’Ashen Wolf Lord,’ which secured third place in that year’s Breeder Contest!\"\nAshen Wolf Lord? A Monarch Level Evolutionary Body of the Flame Wolf. However, third place in a Breeder Contest? Obviously, either there were some incredible research findings among the competitors that year, or the Evolution of this Ashen Wolf Lord might have some flaws—either in combat power, potential, or perhaps it simply required more valuable resources. This would make the cost-effectiveness of its Cultivation for Evolution somewhat average. But no matter what, a Senior Breeder was already a person of status. There are hundreds, or even several hundred, Intermediate Breeders in Jianghai, but only a handful of Senior Breeders. Such is the gap.\nSu Ping nodded and proactively extended his hand. \"Su Ping, an Intermediate Breeder from Jianghai.\"\nDing Yan eagerly shook hands with the young Breeder before him, all smiles as he said, \"Breeder Su, so young and promising! We can be considered fellow townsmen. It seems we were in similar situations, not getting much attention in Jianghai, hehe.\"\nHe didn’t rush to say anything more; talking now would be pointless. No one was a fool. Quiet talks and promising conditions were the way to truly sway people’s hearts.\nYet, this sentence alone made Yang He’s eyes narrow slightly.\nDamn it, this guy who previously had a face as sour as a dog’s is really unable to hold in his true colors! And damn, talking about being fellow townsmen, why didn’t he mention that to me earlier?\nNo way. It was at this moment that Yang He remembered he hadn’t finished his conversation with his Master.\nHe had already figured out what these people were trying to do.\nWith that thought, he quickly pulled out his phone again. Sure enough, his teacher had already replied. And it was clear that his teacher was waiting for his response.\n’Teacher, you need to come to the War Wolf Division quickly, there’s trouble!’\n’What’s the problem? Who the hell did you learn that from? Why are you being so coy now?’\nYang He really wanted to reply that he had learned it from his teacher, but alas, he didn’t have the luxury of retorting at the moment.\nWithout a second thought, he typed:\n’Su Ping is here!’\n’?’\n...\nWhile Yang He sent his messages quickly, Chief Lin’s introductions were no less swift.\nBy then, Lin Lei had already pointed to the next person, a woman dressed in black. \"This is Ms. Rong Qiu, a council member of the Beiyuan Province Breeder Association. She’s also a Senior Breeder specializing in Snow Wolves. Six years ago, she pioneered the Snow Wolf’s Evolutionary Body, the ’Cold Water Wolf.’\"\nThe Snow Wolf, a special Pet Beast Evolutionary Body with connections to water, ice, and wind elements, was indeed intriguing.\nSu Ping once again extended his hand.\n\"Pleased to meet you, little brother,\" Rong Qiu said with a smile.\nThis woman’s appearance aside, something about her gave him a sense of foreboding, and he subconsciously didn’t want to be too close to her.\nHowever, she seemed to want to be exceedingly friendly with him. \"Little brother Su, you should call me when you come to Beiyuan Province to visit!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 166: Chapter 127: Snatching People! Su Ping Becomes a Coveted Prize!_3\nSu Ping chuckled lightly. He really had no interest in visiting that region. However, when he recalled that his father was in Beihai City, which seemed to be part of Beiyuan Province, he nodded.\nThe next two Breeders, one for the Shadow Wolf and one for the Hunting Wolf, were also not from Jianghai Province. The Shadow Wolf’s Breeder was from Minyue Province and was rumored to be a close friend of the direct superior of an instructor within their organization. Although this Breeder hadn’t pioneered a special Evolutionary Body for the Shadow Wolf, he had successfully cultivated several Shadow Wolf Evolutionary Bodies. This time seemed to be no different. The Hunting Wolf’s Breeder was from Anqing Province.\nSu Ping took note of their names and even exchanged contact information with those who seemed friendlier, like Ding Yan and Rong Qiu. More friends meant more opportunities, especially since these weren’t ordinary connections. Although Su Ping had no immediate plans to work with other Wolf Pets, the future was always unpredictable.\nAfter the introductions, Ding Yan couldn’t contain himself. He truly looked down on Jianghai Province, but he found this young man quite admirable.\nYoung, yet neither arrogant nor impetuous.\n\"Su Ping, about that Wanmu Wolf Chief Lin mentioned earlier...\"\nAs expected, the conversation had turned in that direction.\nSu Ping touched his nose awkwardly. \"It is indeed the newest Evolutionary Body I’ve researched. However, I can’t take all the credit. The initial direction was discovered by Breeder Sun Chaoju from Linzhou.\"\nSuch modest words didn’t cause the others to think less of him. On the contrary, their eyes shone with even greater admiration. He didn’t try to claim all the credit, nor was he arrogant.\nAs for Sun Chaoju’s discovery? No one truly cared, not even Yang He. On Blue Star, various Evolutions occurred frequently, and wild Evolutionary Bodies could even be found in the wilderness at times. However, what truly mattered was the ability to transform discovered wild Evolutionary Bodies into Cultivation methods usable by Breeders and Beast Tamers. As for the discoverer? Well, that was all there was to it. Otherwise, why would Su Ping, and not Sun Chaoju, be here for the Legion’s Cultivation? Sun Chaoju himself had worked on it for several years with nothing to show. That alone spoke volumes.\n\"What’s the Racial Potential Rank of the Wanmu Wolf?\" someone couldn’t help but ask.\nSu Ping didn’t refuse to answer. \"Monarch Level. As for its specific Skills, allow me to keep you in suspense. You’ll all find out during tomorrow’s competition, won’t you?\"\nEveryone nodded and didn’t press further. They knew Su Ping wouldn’t tell them even if they asked. Still, this information was enough. Monarch Level! This signified it was a superior Evolutionary Body of the Forest Wolf. This alone was proof that the Evolution was a success. Moreover, it wasn’t an Evolution with exceedingly difficult requirements; otherwise, the military wouldn’t have assigned Su Ping to cultivate for the Forest Wolf Troop.\nFinally, Ding Yan could no longer hold back. He genuinely disdained Jianghai Province. Now that such a capable Breeder had emerged in Jianghai, it would be a true pity for him to remain there. Despite having known him for only a short while, Ding Yan initiated the conversation. \"Little Su, do you mind if we talk privately for a moment?\"\nSu Ping was startled, but Lin Lei, who was beside him, showed no surprise. Although the Legion had little involvement with local affairs, Lin Lei could guess some of what was happening.\n\"Is there something you wish to discuss, Breeder Ding?\"\nDing Yan said with a smile, \"Let’s talk privately. I have something I’d like to discuss with you, Su Ping!\"\nHowever, before he could finish his sentence, Rong Qiu laughed and said, \"Actually, there’s nothing to hide. Everyone knows what’s going on. It’s just an attempt to poach someone, isn’t it? Su Ping, are you interested in moving to another province’s Breeder Association?\"\nRong Qiu directly exposed the truth, causing the others’ expressions to change. Ding Yan, in particular, glared angrily at her.\nThis woman from the north just doesn’t think straight. What good does it do them to expose things like that? Isn’t it undignified to openly poach talent and discuss terms?!\nHowever, Rong Qiu clearly didn’t care. She shrugged, completely indifferent to Ding Yan’s angry glare.\nSu Ping finally understood. President Liu had mentioned this to him before. He was already aware of the issues surrounding provincial performance and resource allocation, but he’d never imagined he’d become directly involved.\nSeeing that the issue was now out in the open, Ding Yan stopped pretending. Ignoring Yang He’s angry glares, he said directly, \"Su Ping, what future could you possibly have staying in Jianghai Province? Others might not know, but how could I be unaware? This Jianghai Province has long been rotten to the core. Otherwise, how could a genius Breeder like you receive treatment even worse than Breeder Yang’s?\"\nSu Ping was stunned again.\nDing Yan wasted no time and continued, \"I can promise you right here: join the Huaiyang Province Breeder Association, and your promotion to Senior Breeder this time is guaranteed. Additionally, you’ll receive an annual research grant of more than five thousand points. We can discuss various other benefits and advantages in detail later!\"\nAs a director of the Huaiyang Province Breeder Association, he naturally had some authority in these matters. The offer was undeniably attractive.\nFive thousand points! How much was that Sun Crystal he’d exchanged for previously? With these five thousand points, one could exchange for several Monarch Level resources and even save up for Emperor Level resources.\n\"This... Thank you for your kind offer, Senior Ding, but I’m used to living in Jianghai, and I don’t have any plans to move to another city for now.\"\n\"Habits can be changed, you know. I guarantee you won’t regret coming to Huaiyang. That’s how I made the move myself...\"\nDing Yan continued to persuade him, his admiration for Su Ping evident. However, this was clearly just the beginning. The other Breeders, representing their respective provinces, also joined the bidding war.\n\"Su Ping, Minyue Province here...\"\n\"Su Ping, Anqing Province...\"\nSuddenly, the Division Commander’s spacious office in the command center turned into a bustling marketplace, with everyone haggling. Lin Lei didn’t mind; instead, he watched the scene with keen interest. Rong Qiu, who had earlier revealed their intentions, also watched with amusement. This Breeder from Beiyuan Province, having exposed the others’ intentions, now remained silent. She didn’t join the scramble. Instead, her narrow eyes sized up Su Ping, a cryptic smile playing on her lips.\nHowever, while those two could watch with composed interest, Yang He, standing to the side, was growing increasingly restless.\nIf his teacher didn’t arrive soon, these ’demons’ would truly carve up and devour Su Ping, this ’Tang Monk’s flesh’! He wouldn’t be able to stop them then!\nSu Ping hadn’t expected that upon arriving at the Legion, even before the competition began, a battle for him would erupt within the War Wolf Division. Naturally, he had no intention of leaving Jianghai. The investment in Heart of Woods wasn’t merely financial; it represented his family’s painstaking effort. Moreover, Su Ping believed President Liu wouldn’t be outmatched by these offers. However, the current situation was becoming a bit overwhelming for him.\nDamn it, they’re going to eat me alive!\nHowever, just then, an angry and familiar voice finally boomed from outside the door, \"Who’s trying to steal someone from my Jianghai Province?\"\nSu Ping and Yang He both breathed a sigh of relief. Sure enough, the office door was pushed open. Liu Fuhai, his face dark but brimming with an almost manic joy, appeared at the entrance.",

      "content": "Chapter 167: Chapter 128: If the Duke Does Not Abandon Me, I Wish to Acknowledge Him as My Foster Father in the Morning Court\nVice President Liu was furious.\nDamn it! An exceptional Breeder had finally emerged from Jianghai Province, and at this critical juncture, I didn’t even know?! After all this effort, he was almost lost to others. Fortunately, I still have a reliable disciple. Otherwise, if I were relying on Zhao Deguang, Qin Erlong, and that good-for-nothing bunch, I wouldn’t have even known if Su Ping had been snatched away by Breeders from other provinces!\nVice President Liu’s squinty eyes, this time, were undisguised in their icy glare at the other Breeders present, especially Ding Yan. Although both their ranks were Advanced Level, their statuses were worlds apart. Ding Yan was only proficient with the Flame Wolf and had barely reached that level a few years ago, while Liu Fuhai was a veteran of many years. Previously, Liu Fuhai had also tried to win Ding Yan over, explaining the current situation of the Jianghai Province Breeders Association, but Ding Yan had shown no signs of changing his mind. However, as the Senior Breeder leading the new Junior Breeders from Huaiyang Province on this visit, Liu Fuhai had been quite polite to Ding Yan previously. But now, things were completely different.\nLiu Fuhai’s icy gaze didn’t seem to intimidate Ding Yan, who simply responded with a slight smile. However, nothing more was said. After all, their positions were clear, and poaching talented Breeders from other provinces was something both sides engaged in. Although being caught red-handed was somewhat embarrassing, it wasn’t cause for a public meltdown like a shrew.\nVice President Liu looked at Su Ping, who had already stood up. His dark old face, with an expression change more astonishing than even the little Paperman Qian Yi’s renowned face-changing act, blossomed into an incredibly radiant smile. \"Su Ping, you kid! Such a big deal, and you kept it from me!\"\nAlthough his tone was reproachful, Vice President Liu’s beaming old face showed not a trace of actual blame.\nIf being kept in the dark always meant such good news, I’d wish for it to happen more often!\nSu Ping quickly said, \"I really didn’t mean to hide it from you. I’ve been so busy with so many things, I just haven’t made it over to the Breeders Association...\"\nQin Erlong chuckled, \"I can vouch for that. You haven’t called Xiao Ping for over a month!\"\nVice President Liu shot him a glare.\nDamn it, now I finally understand what those text messages from Zhao Deguang and this Qin Erlong—those two old bastards—were all about! So they knew all along and were just bullying me, Old Liu, for not knowing? And I supposedly didn’t call Su Ping to ask? Was it that I didn’t want to? No, I didn’t dare to! I was afraid that if I pressed him, it would affect his mental state and potentially ruin his research on the Wanmu Wolf. Who the hell could have imagined that in just two or three months, this damn kid would not only complete the cultivation of the Wanmu Wolf but also get in touch with the Legion? And he had even directly completed the cultivation for the Legion’s Forest Wolf Troop? If someone had told me that, I, Vice President Liu, would have considered them an idiot. But now, I, Liu Fuhai, feel like I’m the idiot myself.\nCan a Genius Breeder truly be judged by ordinary standards? Wasn’t the Sand-Eating Jiao evolutionary body from the Legend of the Holy Dragon obscure before its meteoric rise to fame? Of course, the Sand-Eating Jiao is ultimately not comparable to the Wanmu Wolf. Although both are Monarch Level evolutionary bodies, the Sand-Eating Jiao, in the hands of that Legend of the Holy Dragon, involved the cultivation of a Super-Rank Skill! This made that individual not only a Genius Breeder but also a powerful Beast Tamer. I haven’t seen the Wanmu Wolf with my own eyes yet, but a Super-Rank Skill... that’s still too far-fetched. However, comparing that Legend to Su Ping is, in itself, an exceedingly demanding task. Throughout history, how many Beast Tamers like that have there been? Su Ping, as he is now, has already amazed me.\nSo, at this moment, Liu Fuhai didn’t say much more, just smiled and nodded, \"Alright, alright, my fault, my fault. Let’s go, Su Ping. No point staying here. Let’s head straight to Old Zhao’s place; it’s almost lunchtime. You have to tell me properly, kid, how exactly did you manage to breed it?\"\nSu Ping nodded helplessly and was thus unceremoniously whisked away. The others could do nothing. Unless Su Ping himself wanted to leave, poaching someone of his caliber wasn’t so easy—otherwise, it wouldn’t lead to the almost annual spectacle of inter-provincial disputes over such matters reaching the Imperial Capital.\nOf course, Su Ping didn’t refuse; there wasn’t much for him to do by staying anyway. At most, he could exchange some ideas with these other Wolf Pet Breeders.\nBut at this moment, in Old Liu’s eyes, these other Wolf Pet Breeders had thoroughly transformed into scheming Old Wangs, all coveting the prize cabbage in his own field. Leaving Su Ping to interact with these people? Wouldn’t that be like sending a sheep straight into a tiger’s den?\nIn the end, before leaving, Liu Fuhai couldn’t resist turning back to glance at the group, saying, \"Gentlemen, we are still in Jianghai. Let’s not make things too unsightly.\"\nThis remark was clearly directed at Ding Yan. Ding Yan’s brow furrowed, but ultimately, he didn’t dare to say anything more.\nOnce they were in the vehicle heading to the Legion headquarters, Old Liu patted Su Ping on the shoulder, \"Well done! Don’t listen to those people. I’m telling you, whatever they can offer, Jianghai Province can match it completely!\"",

When the time comes, take whatever you fancy. If that’s not enough, move an entire laboratory from the Breeder Association!\"\nThe equipment and resources within the Breeder Association are different. The equipment is actually purchased with money and is considered property of the local Breeder Associations, while the resources are distributed by the headquarters.\nHowever, it was rare for Su Ping to make demands, so Old Liu, who had just made a promise, naturally wouldn’t go back on his word so quickly.\nA few pieces of experimental lab equipment, even if paid from Old Liu’s private account, were insignificant. As long as he could keep Su Ping tied to Jianghai Province, it was all worth it.\nBut Liu Fuhai was genuinely curious, \"Speaking of which, you’ve always wanted those high-tech experimental labs. What exactly do you plan to do? Pet Beast breeding doesn’t usually require them that much, right?\"\nIndeed, not much. Such high-tech lab equipment is generally used for resource analysis, and the primary purpose of resource analysis is to create Magic Potions.\nBut in reality, although Magic Potions are closely related to Pet Beast breeding, for Senior Breeders who are truly focused on researching Pet Beast Evolution, they aren’t of much practical use.\nSu Ping smiled faintly, \"I was curious about the properties of some Magic Potions and wanted to research them more deeply.\"\nA laboratory might not always be in use by a Breeder, but it is indispensable.\nEspecially now, Su Ping still couldn’t forget about his intended in-depth research into Wolf Tobacco.\nIn fact, his desire for it had only intensified over this period.\nHe remembered that when testing the Heart of Woods Magic Potion made from Wolf Tobacco, a Little Forest Wolf had comprehended the Heart of Woods after consuming just three-fifths of the potion.\nHowever, its Level had consequently dropped by one.\nYet, the concentrated liquid of Wolf Tobacco had no effect on the little white mice used for experiments.\nSu Ping was already quite interested in the effects of Wolf Tobacco. This interest intensified after his previous observations of Pet Beast regression in the Forest Wolf and Elf Wolf, making the plant even more valuable for his research.\nIf the Forest Wolf’s Level could regress instead of advancing, could its bloodline also regress?\nCould it allow some Pet Beasts with powerful inherent Races to devolve, reverting to ancient, unevolved forms?\nCould this lead to the complete restoration of ancient Pet Beast species, allowing for the cultivation of even more diverse evolutionary branches?\nThis was why Su Ping had been so determined to secure his own laboratory.\n\"Youth is wonderful! But, Su Ping, while breeding Pet Beasts, you mustn’t forget to cultivate and evolve your own Pet Beasts, as well as your own training. Your current Realm is satisfactory. However, as you progress, advancing your own Realm is also crucial for breeding Pet Beasts better,\" Old Liu remarked.\nAt that moment, Qin Erlong added a reminder.\nSu Ping nodded. He knew that advancing in Realm also improved one’s physical condition and lifespan. Although this improvement wasn’t as significant as the increase in spiritual power, the saying still held true: the body is the capital of revolution.\n\"Your second Pet Beast is the Paperman, right?\" Qin Erlong asked.\n\"Yes!\"\nSu Ping nodded again. Beside them, Vice President Liu frowned slightly as he looked at Su Ping. He opened his mouth as if to say something, but then refrained.\nThe Paperman was a type of Pet Beast whose characteristics had been thoroughly established by countless Breeders proficient in the Necromancy Series. However, Su Ping had already contracted it, so what more could he say?\nQin Erlong, however, wasn’t too concerned. He wasn’t a true Breeder and didn’t know much about the difficulty of cultivating a Paperman, so he actually believed Su Ping could achieve what ordinary people couldn’t.\nThus, Qin Erlong said, \"Has Xiao Xue told you about going to the Magic Capital in two months? The Magic Capital Academy has two Meditation Methods. Xiao Xue has likely told you about her Forest of Myriad Forms. Her second Pet Beast is a Wood Element Plant Type, which is why she can cultivate that particular method.\n\"Since you chose a Necromancy Series Pet Beast, you can try the other one when the time comes: ’Myriad Transformations Meditation Method’.\"\n\"Myriad Transformations Meditation Method?\"\nThis was the first time Su Ping had heard of other so-called Meditation Methods, as he wasn’t very familiar with the concept in the first place.\nQin Erlong nodded, \"Yes, but I don’t know much about it either. You can check it out yourself when you get there. Meditation Methods, although rare and precious, are essentially just icing on the cake. After reaching the Commander Level, each Realm advancement for a Beast Tamer is a significant hurdle, much more difficult than improving a Pet Beast. I’m just mentioning it in passing; you should be mindful of it.\"\nSu Ping nodded.\n\"Alright, alright, I’m dying of curiosity! Tell us, kid, how on earth did you discover that Wanmu Wolf? What Skills does it have, and what kind of Evolutionary Body is it?\"\nLiu Fuhai clearly had little interest in such troublesome things as Meditation Methods or breakthrough bottlenecks for Beast Tamers. At this moment, his entire focus was on the Wanmu Wolf.\n\"Alright, there’s no need to rush this. Let’s go eat first,\" Qin Erlong interjected.\nThe vehicle stopped, and after a few minutes, Su Ping finally saw the highest-ranking officer of this Legion.\nHowever, this General Zhao appeared extremely kind, always wearing a gentle smile.\nA hero emerges in youth.",

Perhaps because it was a special meal, the flavor was surprisingly good.\nAs for Vice President Liu, he didn’t seem interested in eating at all. He bombarded Su Ping with questions at the dinner table about Cultivation processes, trigger conditions, and more.\nSu Ping didn’t really have anything to hide. The Evolution Law for the Wanmu Wolf would have to be presented at the Breeder Competition anyway, and it was a good idea to give President Liu a heads-up.\nWhile Su Ping was engaged in a lively conversation, Yang He, at that moment in the headquarters, had just finished his tasteless military meal. He immediately returned to his resting area and took out his mobile phone.\nThere were various messages on the phone: some news, some notifications, and some messages that were read but he didn’t feel like replying to.\nAlmost without thinking, Yang He clicked into a group chat. Inside this group chat, there were quite a few messages mentioning him.\nThe name of the group was also quite distinctive: ’Jianghai Wolves’.\nAt first glance, the group name seemed a bit informal. But in fact, it was quite formal, and there weren’t many members—just about twenty or so. However, the people in this group were all prominent figures within Jianghai Province, and those mentioning him at this moment were among them.\n[Wolf Den-Sun Chaoju: @Sand-in-Yang, Old Yang, what’s it like inside the Legion? Can you take some photos for the brothers to see?]\n[Shadow of the Wolf (Mu Hang): Stop talking nonsense! What kind of place is the Legion? You think they let you take photos there? Don’t go looking for trouble!]\n[Wolf Den-Sun Chaoju: I’m just curious, damn it! If it weren’t for some Breeder who popped out of nowhere, a spot in the Legion’s Cultivation would have definitely been mine!]\n[Li Weiwei: Then why didn’t you get in? In the entire Jianghai Province, it seems like only Old Yang got the chance for the Sand Wolf Cultivation, right?]\n[Shadow of the Wolf (Mu Hang): If Old Zhao hadn’t been too busy working with President Liu on that Icefang Whitewolf project, I bet he would have had a chance to get in too, right?]\n[Old Zhao: No, no, no. I heard that this time a Senior Breeder from Beiyuan Province came. And the evolved Ice System and Poison Type hybrid Pet Beast they’re cultivating is apparently quite rare. I really don’t have that kind of skill...]\n[Wolf Den-Sun Chaoju: Enough chatter, where’s Old Yang? @Sand-in-Yang, isn’t the official competition tomorrow? Have you seen who this Forest Wolf Breeder is?]\n[...]\nA series of mentions made Yang He scroll through them for quite a while. In the end, he reached the bottom, only to find Sun Chaoju still pestering him about the identity of the Forest Wolf Breeder.\nClearly, this guy is bothered because he was edged out and missed the chance to be involved. He’s dead set on finding out which Breeder came out of nowhere to take what he thought was rightfully his. Too bad for him.\nYang He clicked his tongue.\nHowever, in their small group chat of Wolf Pet Breeders within the Jianghai Breeder Association, there weren’t really any secrets.\nEveryone knew that the identity of this Legion’s Forest Wolf Breeder was the only one not yet revealed. Naturally, many people were curious and tagging him.\n[Sand-in-Yang: Didn’t Vice President Liu also arrive today? Why don’t you guys ask him?]\n[Wolf Den-Sun Chaoju: You finally show up! Stop beating around the bush and spill it! Have you seen that Forest Wolf Breeder or not?]\n[Sand-in-Yang: I’ve seen him, and we had a great chat. Old Sun, Old Wang, you two can stop feeling resentful. He’s simply better than you!]\n[The Old Wang Not Next Door: Hey, Old Yang, I didn’t do anything to you, did I? What’s this got to do with me?]\n[Wolf Den-Sun Chaoju: When I get back, I’ll treat you to three rounds at the Di Hao. How about that? Spill the beans, quick!]\nSeeing Sun Chaoju’s promise, Yang He chuckled.\n[Sand-in-Yang: Actually, you all know him.]\n[Li Weiwei: ?]\n[Shadow of the Wolf (Mu Hang): Who is it? If you keep stringing us along, forget about the Di Hao when you get back. You’ll be going for a winter swim in the Lingxi River!]\nSeeing that the atmosphere was ripe and everyone else was sufficiently intrigued, Yang He decided to stop holding back.\n[Sand-in-Yang: Su Ping!]\n[Wolf Den-Sun Chaoju: What?!]\n[Li Weiwei: ?]\n[Shadow of the Wolf (Mu Hang): ?]\n[Old Zhao: ?]\n[...]\nA flood of question marks exploded in the chat, even drawing out a few \"old turtles\" who had been lurking silently. This undoubtedly gave Yang He’s ego a huge boost.\n[Wolf Den-Sun Chaoju: What the hell?! The Legion’s Breeder for Forest Wolves is Su Ping? Is that the Su Ping I know? Su Ping from Linzhou, the one with the Heart of Woods?]\n[Sand-in-Yang: No kidding. Do you know another Su Ping? When he arrived this morning, it shocked the hell out of me. I almost thought I was seeing things.]\n[The Old Wang Not Next Door: So, Su Ping went to cultivate Forest Wolves... then what he cultivated is...]\nThis time, Yang He didn’t keep them in suspense.\n[Sand-in-Yang: The Wanmu Wolf.]\nIn an instant, the previously boisterous group chat fell silent at this revelation. Everyone watching the chat seemed to be digesting this piece of news—information that none of them had initially been able to process.\nThe Wanmu Wolf... succeeded?! A brand-new, never-before-seen Evolutionary Body of the Forest Wolf has emerged? And from the hands of a kid who just graduated?\nIndeed, such news required some time to sink in.\nAfter all, those present were Intermediate Level Breeders of Wolf Pets. After many years of hard work and study, they had all strived to create their own novel Evolutionary Bodies, hoping to advance to Senior Breeder.\nBut was it really that easy?\nIn their view, common Pet Beasts like Wolf Pets had been thoroughly researched over the years. Where would there be new Evolutionary Bodies left for them to discover?\nYet, reality had just slapped them across the face.\nA kid who had just graduated... had succeeded!\nHowever, the brief silence was shattered by a barrage of messages that almost instantly flooded the screen.\n[Wolf Den-Sun Chaoju: Holy crap?!]\n[Wolf Den-Sun Chaoju: I always said the Wanmu Wolf was absolutely feasible! See! I was damn right!]\n[Wolf Den-Sun Chaoju: Damn it! When that kid met me last time, he totally kept me in the dark! He just casually said he’d made ’a bit of a breakthrough’? No way! When I get back, I’m making that brat treat me!]\n[Shadow of the Wolf (Mu Hang): Su Ping wasn’t wrong, though. It *was* ’a bit of progress.’ But damn, Sun Chaoju, you really hit the jackpot with luck, stumbling onto this. *You’re* the one who should be treating!]\n[Li Weiwei: Jackpot luck +1]\n[...]\nIt really was incredible luck!\nSun Chaoju, who was currently in Shuhua City, was grinning from ear to ear.\nEven though I wasn’t the one who perfected the Evolution, just being the discoverer is enough! It’s unlikely to make me a Senior Breeder, but this is still huge!\nThis was a chance to make a name for himself. The new Evolutionary Body of the Forest Wolf, the ’Wanmu Wolf,’ was first discovered and researched by him.\nIt wasn’t just about fame, but also tangible benefits!\nAs the discoverer, never mind the popularity it’ll bring to my Wolf Den, just my share of the academic credits alone will allow me to get many valuable resources that money can’t buy on the open market!\nFor a moment, Sun Chaoju felt that the money he’d promised to spend treating Yang He was utterly worthwhile.\nAs for Su Ping? He’s no longer just that Genius Breeder junior I once knew.\nAt this moment, Sun Chaoju’s thoughts mirrored Li Shu’s.\nTowards this Breeder, who was more than a decade younger than him, Sun Chaoju only wanted to say one thing:\n\"Sire, if you would not abandon this humble one, Chaoju is willing to acknowledge you as his foster father!\"\n...\nYang He ignored the commotion in the group chat and contentedly put down his phone.\nWhile this minor earthquake was shaking the Breeder circles of Linzhou, the day at the military camp proceeded in an orderly fashion.\n「And so, the day slowly passed.」\nFinally, under the expectant gazes of the entire Legion, the long-awaited and momentous competition began.",

The First Enemy of the Forest Wolf Troop!\nThis was an open-air square, somewhat resembling the sports fields from his school days, though with some distinct differences. On one side of this square stood a giant screen. Simultaneously, small screens were positioned in front of the numerous small seating areas arranged in all directions. At this moment, figures in groups of five stood together in the center of the square.\nThanks to Old Qin and Old Liu, Su Ping could sit in the front row, even though it felt like sitting on pins and needles.\nWho is in this front row?\nThe most central figure was Zhao Deguang, along with a general from the Shanyuan Ground Forces, distinguished by the stars on his shoulders. Besides him, Liu Fuhai and Qin Erlong sat nearby. There were also several others at the same rank but with different powers and titles. But undoubtedly, even Chief Lin was sitting in the second or third row at this moment. As for the other Breeders, they had their own visitor seating and could not be seated here at all.\nEven though Su Ping was just sitting at an edge, he felt nervous.\nIs this a place he can sit in casually?\nBut fortunately, at this time, no one was paying attention to him. All eyes were on Zhao Deguang in the center of the front row.\nAt this moment, looking at the elite soldiers in their groups of five in the center of the ’square’, and their respective group leaders, Zhao Deguang slowly stood up.\n\"All battle groups, sound off!\"\nFrom the formation, voices cried out one after another:\n\"Reporting, Commander! Hunting Wolf Group leader Zhou Long reporting. The Hunting Wolf Group elite squad, five members required, five present. We are ready for inspection, Sir!\"\n\"Reporting, Commander! Snow Wolf Group leader Li Tiefeng reporting...\"\nVoices resonated across the entire field.\nFinally, after all attending personnel were verified and accounted for, the Chief of Staff said with a smile, \"Alright, you should all know why you’re here today. I won’t waste words. This Legion competition is to test the results of your elite cultivation over the past two months!\n\"Legion competitions, unlike Beast Tamers’ arena battles, test your on-the-spot response capability, wilderness survival ability, tactical cooperation ability, and may even test your luck. So, for your competition this time, our comrades in logistics have worked overtime to create a large battlefield for you to display your abilities!\n\"The rules this time are simple: defeat all enemies except for your own team of five and survive until the end. Finally, judgment will be based on the number of enemies you defeat, the number of survivors on your team, and your survival time!\n\"Eliminating an enemy awards one point. Wiping out an entire group awards a total of seven points, which includes an additional two bonus points! For every additional two Xiaoshi of survival, each surviving member of the group earns one point! The last surviving group receives an extra ten points.\n\"Also, be aware that Hypnotic Mist will be released on the battlefield. Your Life Status Monitors will alert you. The Life Status Monitors will also record the attacks you can withstand and the condition of your Pet Beasts. If you exceed these limits, the Life Status Monitor will automatically signal and activate protective measures. At that time, you will be considered eliminated, and someone will come to escort you away!\n\"Additionally, random supply drops will occur on the battlefield.\"\nIndeed, just as Dad said, it’s really the typical battle royale competition format! But that makes sense. This competition format truly tests the comprehensive abilities of the Beast Tamer soldiers in the Legion. Competitions held in an arena are meaningless by comparison. Because neither enemies nor wild Ferocious Beast packs will grant you the courtesy of a fair one-on-one fight.\nSu Ping’s lips curled up. He did not directly cheat by attempting to link any sort of mental vision. After all, the distance was insufficient. Besides, he believed that their recent training in the Heart of Woods meant the five selected Wanmu Wolf Beast Tamer soldiers would not disappoint him.\nNow, there’s only one thing to worry about.\n\"Alright, no more idle talk. Lead them to the battlefield.\"\nThe rules were simply announced, and everyone was equipped with Life Status Monitors, which allowed for direct viewing of the corresponding members’ combat status on the live broadcast. Then, everyone boarded vehicles and headed in a specific direction.\nMeanwhile, on the large screen before them, multiple split-screens appeared. These individual screens represented the corresponding group members. At the same time, the small screens on the seats also lit up. Here, one could choose individual feeds for more detailed and direct observation.\nThe display capabilities of these electronic systems are truly impressive. All the equipment within the Legion had refreshed Su Ping’s understanding of it. Indeed, in any world, the most advanced equipment always began its use within the Legion. The only difference lay in the field of Pet Beast cultivation; unless there were insurmountable barriers, excellent Breeders from the outside world would continue to emerge.\nSu Ping took a slow breath, nervously watching the screens.\nThis competition will likely not conclude within a single day, but viewing the first day should reveal some initial strengths and weaknesses. According to the rules, whether one took the initiative to eliminate other teams or simply lay low waiting for the ’poison circle,’ both were valid strategies.",

After all, if the whole team survived for more than two Xiaoshi, each person would automatically earn one point, meaning five points for the five of them.\nEliminating an entire enemy team would also only yield a mere seven points.\nIf they were unlucky and one escaped, that was just one point per kill.\nHowever, precisely to address this kind of thinking, the shrinking of the poison circle was designed to make later battles increasingly intense.\nIf there were more enemy teams in the final circle, the chaotic battle would introduce too many uncertainties.\nTherefore, deciding whether to strike first and hunt down other enemy teams, or to simply hold back and wait for the final showdown in the closing circle, was a test of a team’s decision-making.\nSu Ping was also contemplating.\nIn a situation like this, what should I do? Given the Wanmu Wolf’s Traits, my first instinct is actually to just hold back! The Wanmu Wolf’s forte is undoubtedly positional warfare. Its ability to create forests can greatly reduce the cost of lying in wait. Although its strength lies in creating forests anytime, anywhere with Skills like Tree Prison and Nature’s Tongue, that still requires time, and if I do that, it’s too easy to attract the attention of others. Besides, there’s one more crucial external factor.\nFinally, the massive black screen above slowly lit up.\nEven in broad daylight, those black screens were crystal clear.\nSu Ping quickly located the Forest Wolf Troop’s position.\nUpon first glance, Su Ping let out a slight sigh of relief.\nClearly, not all teams could have entered the battlefield through the same entrance.\nAll positions were random.\nAlmost all participating teams summoned their Pet Beasts immediately.\nThe Forest Wolf Troop was no exception.\nInstantly, a wave of exclamations erupted across the plaza.\nPet Beast Cultivation was the theme of this competition.\nThis was evident from the Pet Beasts summoned by all the teams.\nInstantly, Su Ping could hear a burst of whispers.\n\"Damn it, you son of a turtle! You actually let the Iron Arm Ape Group cultivate this Great Strength Vajra Ape? Its melee combat is probably unmatched by many in the entire Legion, huh?\"\n\"Hehe, likewise. The Netherworld Demon Tiger is a rare Dark Element Monarch-potential Pet Beast. You really spared no expense this time, did you?\"\n\"...\"\nAmidst these whispers, almost all the troop leaders from War Wolf A Division’s units, along with Chief Lin, the Political Commissar, and staff officers, simultaneously locked onto the Forest Wolf Troop’s position.\nIt wasn’t just them; many in the front row also fixed their gazes on it.\nEveryone knew that the young man at the very edge of the front row—seemingly inconspicuous, yet drawing the most attention—was the Forest Wolf Troop’s Breeder.\nAnd he had cultivated a Pet Beast never before seen.\nWho wouldn’t want to see such a spectacle?\nUnder everyone’s watchful eyes, Li Hang, the Forest Wolf Troop’s leader, and his teammates summoned their Pet Beasts with hardly a thought, the light of the summoning drawing many gazes.\nThe next moment, a few figures appeared within the light.\nLiu Fuhai narrowed his eyes immediately.\nFinally, this new Evolutionary Body of the Forest Wolf was clearly revealed.\nThe massive Forest Wolf’s fur, like strands of interwoven branches and leaves, cascaded down its back, making it resemble a strange old wolf wearing a straw rain cape.\nThe spreading branches and leaves formed two small, Y-shaped horns on its head.\nTwo leaves even dangled from these horns, making it look both cute and inexplicably majestic.\nAt first glance, viewed from the side, it didn’t look like a Forest Wolf but more like a Kylin draped in dark green fur!\nThis was the Wanmu Wolf!\nIn that moment, countless eyes were captivated.\nMeanwhile, apart from those in the front row who were already in the know, others scanning the displays finally noticed these peculiar and utterly bizarre Evolutionary Bodies of the Forest Wolf on the Forest Wolf Troop’s live feed.\n\"Huh? What Evolutionary Body is this?\"\n\"Is this the Forest Wolf Troop’s live feed? Are there any experts on Forest Wolves here? What kind of breed is this thing?\"\n\"No idea, I’ve never seen it before.\"\n\"...\"\nAmidst the fervent discussions, one thing was finally confirmed.\nThis was indeed the Forest Wolf Troop’s live feed, but as for what kind of Evolutionary Body it was, truly no one knew.\nThe consensus was: this was a new type of Evolutionary Body never before seen by the public!\n\"After the Forest Wolf Troop got thrashed by Unit C’s Rock Tiger Troop last time, were they secretly preparing an Ultimate Ability?\"\n\"A new Evolutionary Body... I wonder what its Abilities are?\"\n\"It still comes down to Skills and strength, but judging by its appearance, it can’t be weak!\"\n\"Nonsense, if you could analyze actual strength from appearance, you would have joined the scouting team long ago.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Holy crap! It’s really true!\"\nWithin War Wolf A Division, the Sand Wolf Troop’s leader nearly jumped out of his seat when he saw those five figures.\nHe quickly turned to Zhang Lie,\n\"Commander Zhang, this thing...\"\n\"Just watch and you’ll find out,\" Zhang Lie said, his mouth curving into a smile.",

The First Enemy of the Forest Wolf Troop! _3\nAt this moment, the five members of the Forest Wolf Troop, who were the focus of countless people’s attention, obviously hadn’t lost their composure.\nLi Da said immediately, \"Check the surroundings!\"\nThe environment where the five of them found themselves wasn’t ideal; they were on a flat, rocky plain. This battlefield wasn’t excessively large, but it certainly wasn’t small either. The variety of terrain within it was likely considerable. After all, the participating teams possessed various Attributes. It would be somewhat unfair if certain terrain types were omitted, creating an imbalance due to external factors. However, the entry point was completely random.\nLi Da quickly activated his life-signs watch, accessing the bird’s-eye map within it.\n\"Captain, the surroundings are clear!\"\nFeedback came quickly. Li Da breathed a slight sigh of relief but immediately issued his first command, \"According to the plan, head towards the center!\"\nLi Da pointed directly towards the exact center of this battlefield!\nThey had agreed upon this strategy in the vehicle on their way, understanding the Wanmu Wolf’s advantages clearly. In positional warfare, they were absolutely Unstoppable; the Abilities of five Wanmu Wolves were enough to instantly transform a plain into a vast forest. However, they had to consider the issue of the poison circle. Therefore, in a way, while the center of this battlefield might not be the final zone, it would likely remain trouble-free for a short while. Once they reached the center and established their forest early, they could simply lie in wait for their enemies. The plan was simple, but undeniably efficient and reliable. The only challenge was the possibility of encountering enemies or unknown dangers en route, so speed was essential.\nAfter briefly confirming their bearings, the five mounted their respective Pet Beasts and swiftly headed towards the center.\nSeeing this, Su Ping couldn’t help but nod. This plan was virtually identical to what he had anticipated.\n\"They’ve met, they’ve met! They’ve started fighting over there!\"\n\"It’s the Thaite Ape Master’s Roaring Waters Ape and the War Wolf Division’s Ashen Wolf Lord!\"\nThe exclamations from behind made Su Ping turn his gaze to a nearby screen.\nThe Ashen Wolf Lord... isn’t that the Flame Wolf Evolutionary Body from Ding Yan’s Cultivation?\nSu Ping mused.\nHis luck doesn’t seem too good, running into an opponent with a counter Attribute right at the start.\nHowever, just as Su Ping’s gaze began to shift, a voice sounded close by, \"HISS! That’s... the Rock Tiger Troop’s Earthen Mountain Tiger! Talk about a small world. I heard the Rock Tiger Troop ran into the Forest Wolf Troop last time, didn’t they?\"\n\"It really is! Who would’ve thought? The Forest Wolf’s brand-new Evolutionary Body facing an old rival in its very first battle?!\"\n\"This is going to be interesting!\"\nSu Ping quickly shifted his attention from the Ashen Wolf Lord back to the Forest Wolf Troop.\nSure enough, barely ten minutes had passed before figures appeared in front of the Forest Wolf Troop!\nFigures appeared: a man in an earthy-yellow military uniform accompanied by a large, mottled tiger whose camouflage resembled yellow rocks. They looked excited to see the enemy appear. However, upon spotting the peculiar Forest Wolf, both the Pet Beast and its Beast Tamer visibly faltered for a moment.\nWhat in the world is that thing?\nBut, while they didn’t know what kind of Evolutionary Body it was, the identity of the Forest Wolf Troop was still instantly recognizable.\n\"Well, well, isn’t that Captain Li? What a coincidence, huh?!\"\nIt was indeed a coincidence. Li Da laughed too.\nJust over two months ago, this bastard led his men to ’eliminate’ me,\nhe recalled.\nTo think that in this competition, I’d run into this guy in such a godforsaken corner of the battlefield. And his luck is damn good too, showing up in terrain that perfectly suits his strengths.\nYet, Li Da showed no concern or fear. In fact, at this moment, he was brimming with fighting spirit.\nIt wasn’t just Li Da; Su Ping, watching at this very moment, felt the same way. This was because after they entered the battlefield, a great weight had finally been lifted from Su Ping’s mind. He had initially worried that the battlefield might be some kind of Secret Realm or perhaps a mechanical Simulation Space. But it was clearly a purely realistic environment; there were even some wild Pet Beasts roaming about. Therefore, the current weather outside matched the weather within the battlefield.\nWith this thought, Su Ping didn’t immediately turn his attention back to the screen. Instead, he took a leisurely moment to glance up at the sky.\nA perfectly clear sky, really nice,\nhe thought.\nA gentle, refreshing breeze, and the sunlight is just perfect.",

      "content": "Chapter 173: Chapter 130: Forest Webbing! The Terrifying Wanmu Wolf!\n\"The Forest Wolf Troop isn’t having much luck!\"\n\"That’s not necessarily true,\" another voice countered. \"Although the terrain is more advantageous for the Rocky Tiger Troop, it must be understood that the Wood Element has a restraining effect on Earth-type Pet Beasts.\"\n\"The Earth Giant Tiger isn’t like ordinary Earth-type Pet Beasts,\" a third spectator mused. \"Strictly speaking, the Earth Giant Tiger should be considered Rock Element, which somewhat weakens the Wood Element’s suppression. It also depends on the evolutionary quality of each Race!\"\nAbove the stands, a series of whispers rippled through the crowd. Undoubtedly, this debut battle for the Forest Wolf Troop’s new Evolutionary Body was attracting far more attention than most other team encounters.\nCompared to the unknown Wanmu Wolf, it was clear that more people favored and were optimistic about the Earth Giant Tiger, which held the terrain advantage.\nHowever, Li Da and his companions, visible on the projection, paid no heed to these opinions.\nThis was a competition, a battle for their respective honors.\nAt the same time, Li Da and his team could absolutely imagine the intense scrutiny they were under.\nThis was the Wanmu Wolf’s first appearance. They represented not only themselves but also the entire Forest Wolf Troop, and the potential assessment of this Wanmu Wolf Evolutionary Body.\nAlmost without Li Da needing to issue a command, the four Beast Tamers and their four Wanmu Wolves behind him had already formed a line. Upon careful observation, one could see dark green plant tendrils slowly emerging beneath the feet of these Wanmu Wolves.\nThey resembled small green snakes appearing on this Shanyuan.\n\"Attack!\" Li Da’s sharp command cut through the air.\nHis companion Wanmu Wolf, Da Zhuang, moved instantly. However, instead of pouncing towards the opponent’s Earth Giant Tiger, it retreated directly, and the five Beast Tamers spread out as quickly as possible, trying their utmost to avoid a decapitation strike by the opponent’s Earth Giant Tigers.\nAlmost at the exact moment they acted, the Rocky Tiger Troop also made their move.\nThe actions of the human Beast Tamers on the opposing side were almost identical. They momentarily merged with their Pet Beasts before retreating. The next instant, as if the very earth shook and mountains quaked, thick rock walls instantly rose to shield all five of them.\nIn Beast Tamer combat, the Beast Tamers themselves are the most vulnerable points.\nEnsuring the Beast Tamer’s safety while commanding the battle is a mandatory lesson for all Beast Tamers in practical combat.\nAnd that was precisely the situation unfolding.\nThese rock walls formed a protective dome, like an inverted giant bowl, enclosing them within.\nHowever, embedded at the top of this dome were several ’eyes’ that allowed the Beast Tamers to observe the situation outside through the pitch-black rock.\nIt seemed, at this juncture, that the Earth Giant Tiger’s defensive capabilities surpassed those of the Wanmu Wolf.\nThose present here were the elites of the entire Legion.\nMoreover, this was the Rocky Tiger Troop, the same troop that had previously crushed the Forest Wolf Troop. How could such an opponent be anything but formidable?\nBut Li Da and his team were also incredibly swift.\nThey had a much clearer understanding of their own situation.\nThe forest manifested by the Wanmu Wolves served as their most effective dynamic cover.\nIt was infinitely more flexible than the cumbersome rock fortress of their opponents.\nIn fact, under these circumstances, they merely needed to lead the Wanmu Wolves away. While the Earth Giant Tigers were not slow in this terrain, they would absolutely not dare to pursue them into the newly formed forest!\nHowever, the opponents before them were their ’arch-nemeses.’ If they were to simply flee in disarray, they would never forgive themselves, let alone be able to face Chief Zhang Lie and Chief Lin.\nAttack!\nIn that instant, everyone, both within the arena and watching from outside, stared wide-eyed, watching in disbelief at the scene unfolding.\nWhat were they witnessing?\nThe five Earth Giant Tigers roared, charging towards the five Wanmu Wolves that had already melded into the transforming surroundings.\nYet, where moments ago there was only hard, open ground, now stood a dense thicket of enormous trees that had burst forth, completely dominating the landscape.\nThe Beast Tamers, led by Li Da, used the towering trees for support, nimbly darting through the branches.\nThe Earth Spikes summoned by the Earth Giant Tigers erupted from the ground—BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!\nBut try as they might, their attacks could neither reach the Beast Tamers high in the trees nor the Wanmu Wolves, which had vanished completely within the instantly manifested jungle!\nIn that brief span, the Earth Spikes conjured from rock, the ground indentations, and even localized tremors—all were rendered completely ineffective!\nIndeed, on the Shanyuan, the Earth Giant Tigers possessed a significant terrain advantage.\nHowever, when this advantage was utterly negated by the Wanmu Wolves’ outrageously powerful Tree Prison and the forest manifested through their Language of Nature, the Wood Element’s suppression of the Earth Element reached its absolute zenith!\nIn the mere span of three breaths, the small Shanyuan had transformed into a dense grove.\nThis astounding spectacle left not only the members of the Rocky Tiger Troop, still huddled within their stone dome, utterly dumbfounded.\nEveryone in the Legion who had come to witness the Wanmu Wolf’s capabilities was equally stupefied.\nSome might have anticipated the Wanmu Wolf’s abilities to be formidable, but no one could have ever imagined they would be so overwhelmingly, unreasonably dominant.\nThe rapidly proliferating branches, like terrifying giant pythons, snaked towards the five Earth Giant Tigers.\nImpossible to defend against!\nDue to Attribute suppression, the moment the tree roots burrowed in, the condensed rocks were almost instantly forced apart and shattered from within.\nThe lead Earth Giant Tiger was instantly ensnared and lifted by the rapidly spreading branches.",

However, the well-coordinated teamwork they had developed played a crucial role at this moment.\nAs the branches ensnared one Mountain Tiger, the two previously hidden Wanmu Wolves materialized before the others out of nowhere.\nThe branches on their bodies, resembling forest timber, swung with such elegance.\nTheir effortless leaps displayed an agility completely disproportionate to their size!\nThe next moment, an invisible force permeated the forest they had created.\nUnder this force, the few Earth Mountain Tigers felt their stamina depleting even faster.\nRun!?\nIf it were under normal circumstances, they could indeed run.\nThese strange Forest Wolf Evolvers, within this forest of their own creation, had almost no weaknesses.\nIf they could just figure out a way to leave this jungle and engage in guerilla warfare, they might have a chance of victory.\nAfter all, as had been noted, the terrain here offered them an advantage.\nEven if these Forest Wolf Evolvers were formidable, they had their weaknesses; the range and speed of summoning the Jungle Tree Prison were limited.\nAs long as their Pet Beasts’ speed could carry them quickly out of this area, it would undoubtedly cost the opponents more Energy to catch up and continue creating the forest.\nBy then, they could naturally wear them down.\nBut how to run?!\nTheir Beast Tamers were still within that protective circle.\nIf they ran, even though the rocky barriers were extremely solid, they definitely would not hold out for long.\nAfter all, it was the same old story: the Wood Element held an absolute advantage over the Earth Element.\nAt this moment, had the Beast Tamers become their burdens?\nBut in fact, this was merely wishful thinking on the part of the Earth Mountain Tigers and the Beast Tamers of the Rock Tiger Squad.\nBecause at this very moment, only those watching the battle from outside through the radar screen knew the truth: if they hadn’t fled the jungle the moment it appeared, wanting to run away when things went south later would be absolutely impossible.\nOn the retreat path through the jungle, two more Forest Wolves stood guard; the forest floor beneath them offered no foothold.\nThe dense, thick tree trunks had woven the entire jungle into a colossal spiderweb, patiently awaiting prey to stumble into its snare.\nAt this moment, viewed from above, the jungle presented such a scene. It was a huge forest spiderweb.\nThe Wanmu Wolves, leaping and bounding tirelessly across branches and trunks, were the ’spiders’ holding absolute control.\nThe outcome of the battle, in the end, concluded without any surprises. The five Earth Mountain Tigers, weakened to their limits under the influence of the Life Magnetic Field and bound by the branches, had no way to fight back.\nNaturally, the Rock Tiger Squad, huddled within their rock barricades, were completely exposed to Li Da and his team.\nBANG!\nLi Da and his companions had no habit of wasting words in battle; the moment their opponents appeared, the Wanmu Wolves’ attack had already struck.\nSimultaneously, the life signs watch emitted a glaring red light. The next moment, a mechanized voice rang out: \"Attention Hong Lin, member of the Rock Tiger Squad, Fierce Tiger C Division, you have sustained a fatal attack! You are eliminated! Please restrain your Pet Beast immediately and wait at your current location for a referee to escort you out of the battlefield! Your points are: 0...\"\nThe leader of the Rock Tiger Squad’s face paled slightly. He could already imagine their commander’s darkened expression and gaze that seemed ready to devour them. However, there was not much he could say at this moment.\nWith a mixture of unwillingness and helplessness, he could only watch as the Wanmu Wolves slowly retracted the vast jungle, and as Li Da and his companions, grinning, leaped down from the branches.\n\"Eliminated: Entire Rock Tiger Squad of Fierce Tiger C Division. Points Acquired: 7. Current Points: 7.\"\nThe notification from the life signs watch was like a refreshing spring breeze to Li Da and his companions. Their opponents’ furious and resentful glares were the sweetest reward for the victors.\n\"Hahaha, go on, keep boasting now, you lot!\" Sun Xiao, standing nearby, gloated at these ’eliminated’ individuals, taunting them.\nTheir side hadn’t just avoided taking casualties; they hadn’t even suffered injuries. Meanwhile, the opponents were completely wiped out. Such a complete victory was indeed something they had the right to be proud of.\nThe Rock Tiger Squad members ignored him.\nWhat’s there to be proud of when you just got lucky and encountered such an absurd Evolutionary Body?\nLi Da, who knew what mattered most, said, \"Alright, no more wasting time. We’re on a tight schedule. Let’s move.\"\nHaving encountered enemies immediately upon entry, they were unsure if their plan could still succeed.\nHowever, from the very beginning, everything that happened in this battle was undeniably broadcast live for the outside world to witness clearly.\n\"Such an absurd Evolutionary Body!\" someone couldn’t help but exclaim.\nNo one rebutted. At this moment, they all shared the same thought and sentiment. This was simply too absurd.\nIn just a short period, they had already witnessed the numerous advantages displayed by this Evolutionary Body. They had witnessed its absolute control over the forest. It wasn’t just control, but also the ability to shape the forest itself. That was what made it truly rare and valuable.\nPreviously, Forest Wolves were always considered among the Pet Beasts most reliant on their environment. If they couldn’t fight within a forest, the effectiveness and power of their Vine Strangling ability were quite ordinary. Moreover, their growth acceleration ability was, relatively speaking, also quite unimpressive.",

The Terrifying Wanmu Wolf!_3\nCompared to the Duplication Spell, which aimed for a similar outcome, its actual effects were significantly less impressive.\nHowever, what he had not anticipated was that merely by completing an Evolution, this Forest Wolf’s Evolutionary Body would undergo such an astounding metamorphosis.\nEven Vice President Liu couldn’t help but let out a long sigh at this moment. The fist in his sleeve tightened slightly.\nHe had somewhat recovered by yesterday. At the same time, he had asked Su Ping about some details of the Wanmu Wolf’s Evolution. But when it came to Skills, Liu Fuhai didn’t know much at all. After all, Su Ping had said that by tomorrow, he would know, wouldn’t he?\nAnd now, watching the situation unfold on the screen, Liu Fuhai truly understood. It even far exceeded his expectations. He could never have imagined.\nWas the Forest Wolf Evolver that truly came from Su Ping’s hands so outrageously strong?\nWith that thought, Vice President Liu turned his head to glance at Su Ping beside him.\nSu Ping’s eyes were also fixed firmly on the live broadcast screen, nodding occasionally at the situation depicted. Apparently, he was quite satisfied with this first battle of the Wanmu Wolf.\nThe duration of the battle wasn’t long. From start to finish, it didn’t even reach twenty minutes. This was mainly due to the Great Earth Tiger continuously summoning rocks to burst forth from the ground, which somewhat slowed down the weaving of the forest. However, there was one point Vice President Liu beside Su Ping considered. He thought for a moment and said, \"Such a combat method seems overly Energy-consuming. Surely, even if the Forest Wolf can gather Energy through plants, it won’t be able to sustain this combat method for too long, right?\"\nIndeed, creating and weaving an entire forest over such a large area would mean immense Energy consumption, even for an Advanced Level Commander Pet Beast. Under such circumstances, their Energy theoretically could not be sustained for long.\nYet, Su Ping simply smiled.\nGenerally speaking, it indeed couldn’t be sustained for very long. But the Wanmu Wolf’s most wondrous quality lay precisely in this.\nIn fact, not only Vice President Liu thought so. At this moment, anyone who had been watching from the beginning shared this thought.\nIsn’t such a combat method too Energy-intensive?\nAfter all, this was a simulated battle royale on a battlefield, not arena combat where simply defeating the enemy would suffice. Injuries and excessive Energy consumption could very likely cause them to lose the initiative in the upcoming battles on the battlefield. Although they had outside supplies, who knew if they would be lucky enough to find them? And who can be certain about luck?\nThis battle undoubtedly drew many people’s attention to the Forest Wolf Troop. Even most beings in the front row locked their gaze firmly on the Forest Wolf Troop.\nAn Evolutionary Body never before seen in the outside world.\nAn unparalleled ability to create terrain, strong crowd control effects.\nAn unrivaled binding force.\nAlthough their direct offensive power and defensive capabilities seemed slightly inferior based on current observations, this was more than enough!\nThese were all aspects displayed by the Wanmu Wolf.\nHowever, Energy consumption raised a big question mark at this moment.\nIf this were a Monarch Level duel, then no one would have such significant doubts about the Wanmu Wolf. Because reaching the Monarch Level is a true qualitative change. At that Level, one naturally does not need to worry about Energy consumption in the short term.\nBut now, it was at the Commander Level. At this Level, using Skills of such scale and frequency necessitated concern about Energy consumption.\nHowever, just as everyone began pondering this doubt and question, many were taken aback. Because at that moment, through the Forest Wolf Troop’s broadcast perspective, they clearly saw something in the direction the troop was looking. After the Forest Wolf Troop had traveled for about an hour, they came upon a large lake where a chest was floating on the surface.\nAnd that chest was none other than supplies for this battlefield.\nThe supplies randomly scattered throughout the battlefield contained a variety of items. But undoubtedly, Magic Potions for Energy recovery were almost always found inside these supply boxes.\nAt that moment, everyone was slightly stunned.\nDoes the Forest Wolf Troop really have such good luck?\nThey just defeated the Rock Tiger Troop, and now a supply box has appeared?\nThen, someone quickly cried out, \"No! This is wrong! There’s a scheme! Look at the Great Serpent Master’s Whirlpython Troop!\"\nIndeed, following that line of sight, they saw the Water Element Whirlpython Troop’s Beast Tamer warriors and their Evolutionary Bodies. They were currently underneath a body of water, observing the situation on the lake’s surface through a refracting water mirror, including the approaching Forest Wolf Troop.\nA figure beneath the water, along with a massive serpent that seemed to merge with the current, revealed an excited, sinister grin.\n\"The fish has taken the bait, get ready to close the net!\"",

The Background of Rong Qiu!\n\"A supply box!\"\nAll members of the Forest Wolf Troop instantly spotted the supply box floating on the lake’s surface.\nLi Da furrowed his brows slightly, cautiously glancing around.\nIt turned out to be a small lake situated in a depression. It was indeed relatively hidden. The existence of an undiscovered supply box in such a place was, theoretically, quite reasonable.\nWith this in mind, Li Da felt a bit more at ease.\nAfter all, among the various items in a supply box, even something as common as an Energy Recovery Potion could be a lifesaver in many situations. Even if they didn’t need one now, who could say what might happen later?\nHowever, after some thought, Li Da instructed, \"Stay off the water’s surface, Da Zhuang...\"\nUpon Li Da’s order, Da Zhuang focused his mind. A tree branch instantly grew from the shore, stretching out towards the supply box in the middle of the lake.\nHowever, Li Da soon furrowed his brow again.\nFrom his perspective, the supply box wasn’t far—only about twenty meters away. Da Zhuang’s branch should have easily reached it. Yet, as the branch extended, it failed to touch the supply box. Instead, from his viewpoint, the box seemed to be slowly drifting backward—an eerie sight.\nAlmost instantly, Li Da realized the danger and shouted, \"Not good! It’s an ambush!\"\nMeanwhile, the previously tranquil surface of the small lake suddenly erupted with tumultuous waves. A massive, almost transparent figure emerged from the water, giving Li Da no time to react. The spray from the erupting waves instantly condensed, swirled in the mouth of the illusory, transparent creature, and then shot out fiercely!\nIron Water Cannonball!\nThe spinning, compressed water cannon ignored the Wanmu Wolf on the shore and shot straight at the Beast Tamer!\nThere wasn’t just one—there were a full five of them!\nAlmost instantly, information about this strange aquatic serpent surfaced in Su Ping’s mind: Hydro Serpent! Racial Potential: early-stage Monarch. An Evolutionary Body of the elite Pet Beast, Whorl Python. Its main Skills include firing Iron Water Cannonballs—highly compressed water elements—and the ability to merge with water sources in element-rich environments, making it extremely difficult to detect with the naked eye...\nIn this world, all sorts of Pet Beasts and their corresponding Evolutionary Bodies are constantly emerging,\nSu Ping mused.\nHow could there truly be an invincible Pet Beast Evolutionary Body?\nUndoubtedly, at this moment, the Forest Wolf Troop was forced into a completely passive position. This was especially true because the Iron Water Cannonballs targeted the Beast Tamer, not the Pet Beast.\nThe four members further away were relatively safe, but Team Captain Li Da was now undoubtedly exposed to the Iron Water Cannonballs. If he were hit, his vital signs wristband would almost certainly be triggered immediately. An attack from a long-planned, cunning ambush wasn’t going to be easy to dodge, was it?\nHowever, at this critical juncture, Da Zhuang reacted instantly, unleashing its full speed. Its Commandant Ninth Rank body leaped dozens of meters, positioning itself in front of Li Da just before the Iron Water Cannonballs struck.\n\"Da Zhuang!\" Li Da shouted.\nAlmost without thinking, Li Da saw the massive figure of the Wanmu Wolf freeze on the spot.\nEveryone frowned. This was a competition, and injuries were inevitable. After all, it was often difficult to control the intensity of Pet Beast battles. However, if this attack landed, it would cause more than just an injury.\nThis question arose in everyone’s mind.\nIs this Li Da so desperate to avoid elimination that he’d sacrifice his fully evolved Pet Beast? After all, in their view, if this attack connected, the Wanmu Wolf would be crippled, if not killed outright. Why isn’t Li Da activating the protective effect of his vital signs wristband? What is he thinking? Is he really going to stand by and watch the Wanmu Wolf be severely wounded, or even die?\nHowever, just as this thought surfaced, everyone was once again stunned.\nIt wasn’t that the attack was blocked or dodged; the spinning, compressed Iron Water Cannonball indeed struck the Wanmu Wolf’s figure. But at this very moment, the Wanmu Wolf underwent a change that no one had anticipated.\nThe previously agile Wanmu Wolf was now rigidly frozen. Its Y-shaped, antler-like branches atop its head swayed gently, while the foliage extending down its back instantaneously enveloped its body, turning the Wanmu Wolf into a sphere. All previous signs of life from the Wanmu Wolf vanished completely. The encasing foliage extended into the soil beneath its feet, taking root.\nBANG!\nThe Iron Water Cannonball accurately struck the now stationary Wanmu Wolf. And indeed, a spinning crater appeared on its body, right through the covering of leaves. It looked as if an electric drill had bored a hole straight through it.\nBut upon seeing this ’hole,’ everyone was once again dumbstruck.\n\"What is that?\" someone exclaimed in disbelief.\nBecause the scene unfolding before them was astonishing: the hole didn’t reveal bone and organs, nor did any blood flow out. Instead, it looked like a severed tree branch, exposing only woody fibers.\nMost uncannily, as the Pet Beast’s foliage unfurled, the hole began to heal at a slow yet visible rate!",

Even Zhao Deguang, who was not far away, turned to Liu Fuhai, the authority on the matter. Of course, it was also possible he was looking at Su Ping, who sat unassumingly in the corner next to Liu Fuhai.\n\"Wooden Body?!\"\nLiu Fuhai’s tone was somewhat surprised, as if he hadn’t quite reacted, yet he was certain.\nYes, this was the Wooden Body!\n\"Wooden Body? Isn’t that an Ability only possessed by some Plant-based Pet Beasts?\"\nA man beside him, who also bore a general’s star on his shoulder, spoke up in astonishment.\nIt was a characteristic Ability of Plant-based Pet Beasts. Any injury on the body of a Plant-based Pet Beast could recover as long as the root wasn’t directly damaged; even damage to the stem was of no concern.\nAfter all, Plant-based Pet Beasts were mostly slow.\nThis Wooden Body Ability served as a Core Technique and a definite reinforcement for many in the Plant System.\nThe Plant System had no fatal weaknesses.\nBut the question was, was this wolf part of the Plant System?\nJust a moment ago, its frolicking behavior—hopping and leaping in the jungle, appearing and disappearing without a trace—did not resemble a Pet Beast of the Plant System at all!\nA pure Wolf Pet with the Plant System’s ’Wooden Body’ Ability?\nAt that moment, everyone cast complex glances at Su Ping, who remained composed.\nThis included Liu Fuhai.\nEven from the seats on the other side, where the Breeders of the Forest Wolf Troop sat, some people couldn’t help but turn their gaze to Su Ping.\nHow on earth did this kid do it? Could the Evolutionary Body of a Forest Wolf be so freakishly capable?\nThey didn’t understand.\nAmong them, those reacting most strongly were Ding Yan, a Breeder from Huaiyang Province, and Rong Qiu, a woman in black from Beiyuan Province.\nThe former was naturally filled with regret.\nWhy did such a talented Breeder choose to stay in a place like Jianghai Province?\nThe latter, however, was far more conflicted. Her mouth curled into an indecipherable, complex expression, her eyes not even glancing at her own Snow Wolf Group.\nIt was as if she had no interest whatsoever in the Snow Wolf Group’s performance; her gaze remained fixed solely on the Forest Wolf Troop and Su Ping.\nThey didn’t know what other secrets this Wanmu Wolf harbored.\nAt this moment, they had come to genuinely respect this young man—someone they had initially resented for being overly favored by Qin Erlong and Liu Fuhai, who had let him sit in the first row.\nIn the Legion, strength was most respected.\nSu Ping’s Cultivation talent and the Wanmu Wolf he had nurtured had undoubtedly conquered them.\nHowever, the battle on the screen had not yet ended.\nDa Zhuang, with its Mutation: Wooden Body, had entered a wooden state, but its movements hadn’t stopped.\nOn the shore, upon the land, the forest deluge re-emerged!\nThe other Wanmu Wolves also reacted.\nEnraged by the sneak attack, they immediately entered a combat state.\nSu Ping slowly exhaled.\nThe final outcome was still not unexpected.\nEven if the Hydro Serpent could enter the water and survive continuously underwater, its Beast Tamer could not.\nThe Beast Tamer would eventually need to surface for air.\nBesides, who said the Wanmu Wolves had no options underwater?\nAfter all, it was just a small lake, barely a kilometer across and not very deep. The five Wanmu Wolves, anchoring their Tree Prisons to the earth at the water’s edge, dragged them straight into the lake!\nUnder the combined effect of the fivefold Tree Prison and the Language of Nature, the entire lake surface became interconnected by branches.\nIt was still the familiar forest web, only this time it spread across the lake’s surface.\nThe final result was that the Forest Wolf Troop’s Points increased by another 7. This was followed by an additional 5 Points for surviving more than two hours.\nAlthough the process this time had been convoluted and the risks high, everyone fell silent once more as they looked at the screen. The massive web of endless branches and leaves almost completely covered the small lake.\nReality had slapped them hard in the face.\nThey couldn’t help but ponder the question that had just arisen.\nDoesn’t the Wanmu Wolves’ Skill activation require Energy expenditure?\nThis was evident from the battle they had just witnessed.\nThat Hydro Serpent, by maintaining its presence in the lake and drawing support from the water’s Spiritual Power, could ensure rapid Energy recovery.\nHowever, facing the blockade of the forest web, its all-out Iron Water Cannonball attack only managed about twenty-odd shots in succession.\nThis frequency and number of shots were already quite exaggerated and terrifying.\nThe power of the Iron Water Cannonball was also extraordinary.\nEven those dense forest webs would blast open into large clearings when directly hit by an Iron Water Cannonball.\nIf those Hydro Serpents could launch attacks as relentlessly as the Wanmu Wolves activated their entangling forest Skills, and if they could have fired just a few dozen more shots, the outcome of the battle would have been truly uncertain.\nEven if they couldn’t win, escaping unscathed would have been absolutely no problem.\nBut how could such Abilities be used so easily and carelessly?\nYet, the Wanmu Wolves had managed to do just that.\nEven legendary Spirit Saint Level Pet Beasts and Legendary Pet Beasts have to obey the law of Energy conservation, don’t they?\nBut this massive wolf, resembling a Kylin, seemed to utterly disregard the concept of Energy conservation.\nSuch rampant use of its Abilities, yet it showed no signs of Energy depletion or fatigue.",

The Background of Rong Qiu!_3\nYet, he still appeared as spirited as ever.\nClearly, even these experienced seniors had not anticipated that energy conservation indeed existed, but this energy was not purely from the Wanmu Wolf’s internal energy storage, nor was it from food supplements and Magic Potions.\nInstead, it came directly from the Sun in the sky.\nFrom the perspective of physics in his past life, the nuclear fusion energy of the Sun was massively absorbed by the Wanmu Wolf, and through Photosynthesis, it was converted. Then, it was utilized with the help of the Heart of Wood.\nFortunately, following that, the Forest Wolf Troop did not leave to set off again.\nThey rested right by this small lake.\nThe small lake in this depression was already relatively central in location.\nSecondly, though there was sunlight, and the energy of the Wanmu Wolf could rapidly recover,\nthe fast operation of the \"Sunlight Absorption,\" \"Photosynthesis,\" and \"Heart of Wood\" Skills that composed the \"Solar Formula\" placed a tremendous strain on both body and mind.\nThis, Su Ping had previously felt from Old Sha.\nMoreover, just now, Da Zhuang had suffered considerable injuries while helping Li Da to defend against the Hydro Serpent’s Iron Water Cannonball, and he needed to turn into a wooden state for recovery.\nFrom any perspective, Li Da’s decision not to continue leading the team forward was quite wise.\nAnd so, the first day of the competition entered the night as the sky gradually grew dim.\nIn just one day, more than forty people were eliminated, close to ten teams worth of members.\nAnd next to the huge live broadcast screen, there was also a real-time points ranking.\nRight now, at the top of the leaderboard was none other than the Forest Wolf Troop, which no one had expected!\nWith a high score of 29 Points, they occupied the top position.\nCompletely eliminating two teams, that itself was a reward of fourteen Points!\nThe remaining fifteen Points were awarded for surviving unscathed for six Xiaoshi on the battlefield.\nFollowing closely behind was the group that was previously the favorite to win, the Netherworld Demon Tiger.\nThey were only three Points behind the Forest Wolf Troop, the reason being that they had let one escape when they had the chance to wipe out an entire team earlier.\nAfter that was the relatively lesser-known but not to be underestimated Shadow Leopard Troop.\nThe Shadow Leopard shared some similarities with the Shadow Wolf, both being assassin-type Pet Beasts that strike from the shadows.\nHowever, the Shadow Leopard Troop did not fight honorably. Aside from having the Shadow Leopard continue evolving into further Shadow Leopards, they also included the Magic Shadow Leopard, and even the rare Mental Category evolutionary branch, the Soul Eater Leopard.\nWith five combat groups, their Evolutionary Bodies were not the same, which clearly indicated that they had made meticulous arrangements.\nNext was the Great Serpent Master’s Niu Mang Troop, whose Evolutionary Body was the Titan Python.\nThis Titan Python stood out for its blunt force approach, even managing to eliminate the Great Strength Vajra Ape, similarly known for physical strength.\nOf course, the price they paid was that they were the only team in the top five to have lost a member.\nHowever, the fifth place was absolutely unexpected to everyone.\nIt was not any team from another Monkey D Breeder, but rather another team from the Fighting Wolf A Breeder!\nIt was the previously unanticipated Snow Wolf Group!\nThe Snow Wolf Group, along with the Forest Wolf Troop and the Sand Wolf Troop, were originally regarded as the bottom teams of the Fighting Wolf A Breeder. However, unexpectedly, they shone brightly in this competition.\nEven Su Ping couldn’t help but take note of this Snow Wolf Group.\nThe Breeder of the Snow Wolf Group turned out to be a woman named Rong Qiu who came from Beiyuan Province.\nThis Evolutionary Body was her own development, the so-called \"Cold Water Wolf.\"\nThe name of this Evolutionary Body was not very impressive, but its abilities were extremely formidable.\nIt could infuse toxicity into water, which upon only slight contact, could incapacitate an enemy within moments.\nSu Ping watched with a combination of admiration and trepidation.\nPoison Type Pet Beasts, that’s just how terrifying they are.\nOn this first day of the competition, Lin Lei, Chief Lin, was absolutely elated.\nAmong the six participating troops, the Hunting Wolf Group was unfortunate, encountering the ace of the Tiger C Master, the Netherworld Demon Tiger, and was eliminated as a group. The Shadow Wolf Group also met a strong opponent; although they weren’t wiped out, they still lost three members.\nEven so, Lin Lei did not criticize anyone.\nAlthough it was only the first day, the Forest Wolf Troop had taken the lead on the leaderboard.\nThe Snow Wolf Group ranked fifth.\nEven the Flame Wolf Group and Sand Wolf Group that followed were not low in the rankings.\nNeedless to say, Lin Lei was overjoyed.\nThe head of the Monkey D Breeder group, whose teams hadn’t made it into the top five, had a face as dark as pitch—needless to say, he thoroughly berated almost everyone who was eliminated.\nThe battles on the field, even at night, do not stop. On the contrary, there are even some groups that choose to hunt other Pet Beast groups at night.\nHowever, Su Ping didn’t continue to watch. For him, after a day of eye-opening observation, he had some new ideas about Pet Beast Cultivation that needed to be organized.\nHowever, most people were still here, in the square, continuing to watch the competition.\nAfter all, those who could be here were not Low-level Beast Tamers. High-Level Beastmasters possessed sufficient physical fortitude, so staying up all night was trivial for them.\nBut Su Ping absolutely hadn’t expected that, besides him, another person too returned to their residence at night, picking up their phone.\nIt was none other than the Breeder of the Snow Wolf Group that greatly exceeded Lin Lei’s expectations today.\nIt was that Breeder Rong Qiu who also attracted much attention in today’s competition.\nThis Breeder Rong, however, didn’t care much about the rankings.\nHer entire attention was on Su Ping.\nAnd at this time, just like Su Ping, she returned to her residence early.\nShe dialed a phone number directly, and the call was quickly connected, a hearty voice coming through the receiver:\n\"Hello?\"\n\"I’ve seen Su Ping, and his bred Wanmu Wolf Group!\"\nRong Qiu smiled slightly, then lit a slim lady’s cigarette, slowly blowing out a ring of smoke.\nIf Su Ping were here, he would certainly recognize that the voice on the other end of the phone was none other than his unreliable old dad.\nAnd he would probably never have imagined that these two people, whom he would never have expected to know each other, had already met.\nEven more so, the reason this Breeder, who gave Chief Lin an unexpected joy, could become their Snow Wolf Group’s Breeder might mainly have something to do with Su Ping.\n\"Hahaha, how’s it going?\"\n\"Today’s martial contest temporarily in first place, but that might not last past tonight.\"\n\"Hahahaha, I’ve always said, my son’s Cultivation Talent takes after me! Truly impressive.\"\nRong Qiu laughed, almost losing her composure:\n\"If the kid has such amazing Cultivation Talent, why do you need my help?\"\nThe voice from the phone continued:\n\"What do you mean ’your help’? We agreed earlier, not you, but the Rong Family!\"\n\"Without me speaking up, the Rong Family wouldn’t help,\" Rong Qiu said calmly.\n\"Alright, dear Qiu Qiu, just consider it a favor for your team leader. Later, I’ll have Su Ping call you godmother... or if you don’t mind, stepmother is also fine...\"\n\"Tsk, so indecent...\"",

The Battle Arrives Early!\nThe tranquility of the night meant rest for the people and their Pet Beasts in the military camp after a day of training.\nHowever, for all the remaining combatants still on the battlefield, they couldn’t afford to let their guard down—not even a little bit. They had to be even more vigilant.\nBecause nighttime was when most Pet Beasts were in their element, and it marked the beginning of danger.\nAs night began to fall, the release of Hypnotic Mist was initiated across the battlefield.\nClearly, for any team hoping to survive such a night unscathed—especially those holed up on the fringes, just trying to accumulate Points—a chaotic battle was inevitable! And indeed, that was precisely what happened.\nAcross the dark battlefield, the olive-green Hypnotic Mist gradually spread like a fog.\nOn the fringes, other Beast Tamer groups that had remained quiet until now also began to stir.\nThe flames of war were kindled. Beneath the cover of darkness, the battlefield became just as chaotic, especially during the first half of the night.\nThis turmoil, however, seemed to have little to do with the Forest Wolf Troop.\nWhen the contest had first begun, the Forest Wolf Troop had immediately advanced deep into enemy territory, alone.\nNow, in this relatively central part of the battlefield—though not its absolute core—by the small lake, most enemies had still not ventured.\nThe Forest Wolf Troop remained quiet throughout the night. This didn’t mean, however, that the other teams were equally still.\nParticularly noteworthy were the Shadow Leopard Group and the Black Tiger Group, as both of their Evolutionary Bodies were relatively adept at nighttime operations—especially the latter’s Netherworld Demon Tiger, a Pet Beast with the special Dark Element Attribute.\nThey exploited the advantages of the night to the fullest.\nFrom the first half of the night into the second, they managed to knock the Forest Wolf Troop from its first-place position, causing them to drop to third!\nIt was incredibly intense! Even the high-ranking officers within the Legion had never anticipated such a fierce outcome!\n「A day and a night passed.」\nSu Ping awoke, and after freshening up, he returned to the live broadcast plaza for the battlefield. When he looked again, he was momentarily stunned.\nEarly in the morning, the plaza was still packed with almost as many people as before. Some were even eating breakfast while watching the unfolding events on the large screens, their eyes wide with a tension that seemed to surpass even that of the teams shown.\nSu Ping’s pupils contracted slightly as well.\nOvernight, the Forest Wolf Troop had fallen to third place. But, astoundingly, only nine teams remained on the entire battlefield!\nOnly a day and a night had passed! In just that single day and night, the officially deployed Hypnotic Mist had only spread across the outer fifth of the periphery. Yet, only nine teams were left on the entire battlefield.\nFurthermore, this count of nine teams was somewhat misleading. For example, groups like the Flame Wolf Group and the White Tiger Group only had one or two members left, barely clinging to survival.\nEven powerful teams like the Shadow Leopard Group and the Black Tiger Group had suffered one or two losses.\nThis was enough to show just how intense the fighting had become during that single night.\nIt was precisely because of this fierce fighting that when Su Ping arrived, many people turned their gazes towards him.\nThis was because, at that moment, the only team on the entire battlefield that remained completely intact—without a single injury or loss of members, having safely weathered the fiercest battles of the night—was the Forest Wolf Troop.\nAt this point, the Forest Wolf Troop was only a mere one point behind the second-placed Shadow Leopard Group. Such a tiny gap was practically negligible.\nThe reason was simple: with all five of their members unharmed, the Forest Wolf Troop earned slightly more survival Points every two hours than the other teams that had suffered losses.\nSo, even though other teams had eliminated more opponents, the gap between them and the Forest Wolf Troop hadn’t widened significantly under these conditions!\nSu Ping smiled faintly. Looking at it this way, it seemed the minimum expected outcome for this contest was already a sure thing!\nHowever, just as this thought surfaced, something unexpected occurred—an event that neither Su Ping nor the Forest Wolf Troop on the battlefield could have foreseen.\nThe time reached 8:00 a.m. Exactly twenty-four hours had passed since the contest began.\nThe life-sign watches of nearly all Legion members on the battlefield flickered faintly. Then, a notification sound was heard, followed by a message:\n[The contest has proceeded for one day and one night and has now entered a white-hot stage. Current detailed Point rankings and information are now public! Available for query at any time.]\n[1. Black Tiger Group: 81 Points (Elimination Points: 35, Survival Points: 46) Current Remaining Members: 3]\n[2. Shadow Leopard Group: 75 Points (Elimination Points: 23, Survival Points: 52) Current Remaining Members: 4]\n[3. Forest Wolf Troop: 74 Points (Elimination Points: 14, Survival Points: 60) Current Remaining Members: 5]\n[...]\nA series of current rankings appeared before everyone’s eyes almost instantly.\nIn a valley at the center of the battlefield, a man standing beside several giant, pitch-black tigers cursed angrily, \"Damn it! The Shadow Leopard Group, fine, whatever! But where the hell did this Forest Wolf Troop come from?\"\n\"Sixty survival Points? Sixty! Did they actually get the maximum? Where the hell have those guys been hiding out?\"\nIt wasn’t just the Black Tiger Group; other surviving teams scattered across various locations had all, more or less, suffered losses in their numbers during such a night.",

      "content": "Chapter 180: Chapter 132: The Hunt for Forest Wolf Operation? The Final Battle Arrives Early!_2\nAt this moment, the Forest Wolf Troop, having scored perfect survival points and, to top it off, eliminated two other teams, ranked third. This naturally drew everyone’s attention.\nSome analyzed the situation, giving credit to this newly emerged battle group. Previously, only the Black Tiger and Shadow Leopard Groups were considered major threats.\nUndoubtedly, members of the Black Tiger and Shadow Leopard Groups, setting aside the others for now, broke out in a cold sweat.\nIf this fighting continues, our numbers will soon be depleted. And if this Forest Wolf Troop keeps playing possum, they might actually snatch victory! Losing a fair and square beast control duel would be one thing, but losing like this? None of us could accept that.\nTherefore, the leader of the Black Tiger Group immediately adjusted their battle strategy.\nWe have to take out those sly bastards first! Otherwise, who knows when they’ll stab us in the back!\nForest Wolf, is it?\nThe captain of the Black Tiger Group mused, taking an item from his backpack. It was a card slot. He had found this item in a supply box. Supply boxes didn’t just contain food to restore stamina and Magic Potions to replenish Energy; they also held various trinkets potentially useful on the battlefield. This was one such item.\nThe captain of the Black Tiger Group inserted the card slot into his vital signs wristwatch. As expected, a prompt appeared on the watch:\n’Black Tiger Group leader Mo He, you have used the battlefield horn, allowing you to broadcast a message up to 120 characters long, once!’\nWithin less than ten seconds, just as nearly all teams were witnessing their team ranking updates every three minutes, another message came through their vital signs wristwatches:\n\"I am Mo He, leader of the Black Tiger Group. We can’t let the cunning bastards succeed. I can’t ask everyone to put aside their differences and unanimously seek out the Forest Wolf Troop, but please, do try to search the wooded terrains! The Black Tiger Group will start searching from the southeast and spread throughout the south. If any brothers nearby are there, please leave first; my Black Tiger Group is going to find out where Forest Wolf Troop is!\"\nThe horn’s message broadcast clearly, visible to all teams still on the field.\n\"Dammit, this is totally against the spirit of martial arts!\"\nNot only was the Forest Wolf Troop, gearing up for a morning of carnage, taken aback, but even Su Ping, watching from outside the arena, couldn’t help exclaiming, \"Against the martial spirit!\"\nThen, he noticed the contemptuous looks from the others.\nAgainst the martial spirit?! This is eliminating a public menace! Dammit, it was supposed to be a fair competition, and this Wanmu Wolf actually holed up all night! If this continues, they might actually get away with it!\nAlmost the instant after the Black Tiger Group leader’s message was sent, a few other groups that had also acquired horns from the supply boxes broadcasted their messages!\n\"The Shadow Leopard Group is also joining in the hunt for Forest Wolf Troop. I’ll start from the northwest...\"\n\"My Bull Python Group joins too, damn, those sly bastards can all die!\"\n\"The Mountain Mover Ape Group joins in as well! Starting from the due east direction!\"\n\"The Snow Wolf Group joins...\"\nEach one joined the operation known as the ’Forest Wolf Troop Hunting Plan.’\nHowever, Lin Lei’s expression darkened.\nDammit, it’s one thing for teams from other divisions to join, but why the hell is the Snow Wolf Group getting involved? Have they forgotten they’re all from the War Wolf Division? Although this competition is nominally between individual teams, there’s an unwritten rule not to go all out against main teams from your own division. Has the Snow Wolf Group lost its mind?\nOf course, the Snow Wolf Group hadn’t lost its mind. In fact, they spoke out loudly through the battlefield horn, claiming they were going to search to the north. Yet, the live broadcast clearly showed this group of people had no intention of heading due north. To the astonishment of everyone, they actually made a beeline straight for the very center.\n\"A bunch of idiots, let them fight it out!\" the Snow Wolf Group’s captain declared. \"The Evolutionary Bodies cultivated by the Forest Wolf Troop are unprecedented; this is internal intel from our War Wolf Division. How would those outsiders know? They all think the Forest Wolf Troop is just a bunch of sly campers, but didn’t they see them completely dominate and eliminate two teams? Let them exhaust each other; we’ll conserve our strength and snatch the prize later!\"\nThis wasn’t a real battlefield within the Legion, where everyone is a comrade-in-arms, ready to take a bullet for one another. This was a competition. And in that case, unfortunately, the first lesson in the Legion is to do whatever it takes to win on the battlefield.\nDamn, is the Snow Wolf Group just as shameless as the Forest Wolf Troop?\nThe thought rippled through the spectators. Immediately, everyone watching the live broadcast turned to look at Lin Lei, who, somewhat embarrassed, rubbed his nose.\nIf one team acts like this, perhaps it’s just the captain’s fault. But two teams from the same division? It’s hard not to wonder what kind of ’principles’ Chief Lin of the War Wolf Division has been instilling in these little rascals.\nConfronted with everyone’s gaze, Lin Lei couldn’t hold back, \"Why the hell are you all staring at me? What does it have to do with me?\"\nAs it turned out, Chief Lin’s frustration was justified. Because at that moment, some spectators shifted their attention to the Black Tiger Group, the first to broadcast. And the Black Tiger Group? Their trajectory wasn’t southeast or south, as they’d announced. They too were heading straight for the center.\n\"Captain? Weren’t we supposed to head south to search for the Forest Wolf Troop?\"\nBlack Tiger Group’s captain, Mo He, glared, \"How the hell did you become a platoon leader in the group? No wonder you don’t get promoted despite being so strong. Just go because I said so? We’re only three people now. Aside from not being sure to find them, even if we did, what are the odds in a three-versus-five scenario?\"\nThe man who had asked was taken aback.\n\"Let them go search. We’ll profit as the mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind. The cunning guys from the Forest Wolf Troop have indeed reminded me. During the upcoming period, beast control battles are one aspect, ensuring numbers and strength are even more crucial! Let those sons of bitches wear themselves out looking for the Forest Wolf Troop. We’ll recover here at the center. One reason is to accumulate Points, and another is that it’s very likely small groups with only one or two people left avoiding the toxic zone will come here while the rest of the intact teams search for the Forest Wolf Troop... HEH HEH HEH...\"\n\"Brilliant!\" The man slapped his thigh and gave Mo He a thumbs-up.\n\"It’s just basic tactics,\" Mo He said. \"Alright, now that you get it, let’s not waste any more time. Let’s move.\"\nA hush fell over the live broadcast plaza. Onlookers, especially the commander of the Fierce Tiger C Division, watched as his ’brilliant’ Black Tiger Group also headed straight for the center of the battlefield.\nThe commander pursed his lips.\nIndeed, a bit clever, but not very. You damn brat, did you really think that what your pig brain could come up with, other teams wouldn’t? Did you think they’d all be idiots and actually go search the periphery for the Forest Wolf Troop?\nIn fact, it wasn’t just the Snow Wolf Group. After broadcasting the ’Hunt Down the Forest Wolf Troop’ announcement via the battlefield horns and ostensibly reaching a ’consensus,’ none of the other teams that had chimed in actually headed towards the outer areas to search. Instead, every single one of them was rapidly making their way to the center of the battlefield.\nThis development was something even the top-ranking officers watching from the front row hadn’t anticipated. The team ranking display, introduced as the competition heated up, was meant to give the embattled teams a clearer strategic overview. No one could have predicted that it would, under these circumstances, so drastically accelerate the pace and direction of the entire contest.\nBecause it wasn’t long before not only the vast majority of the other teams but even the Forest Wolf Troop—after a brief moment of surprise following their night’s rest by the small lake—also began heading straight for the center of the battlefield!\nIn an instant, the center of the battlefield became the focal point of all attention. Everyone knew that here, the final, decisive battle—which would also be a massive free-for-all—was about to begin, far ahead of schedule!",

      "content": "Chapter 181: Chapter 133: The Final Battle! A Brutal Contest!\nThe very center of the battlefield was a most unique terrain. Only here, in the vast expanse of the battlefield, did such terrain exist.\nThere were no peaks, no lakes or rivers, no deserts or lava flows. Instead, there were continuous buildings and streets.\nThis place was a completely lifelike simulation of a modern urban scene. Concrete houses had been rapidly constructed by Earth-type Pet Beasts, and asphalt streets laid out. If it weren’t utterly deserted, making the ’small town’ feel empty, one might actually mistake it for a real human city at first glance.\nAlthough this small town was a little too small, it was clearly the battlefield—still unmistakably its center, and the location for the final battle.\nWithin this vast battlefield, the ones closest to this very center were the currently top-ranked Black Tiger Group and the Snow Wolf Group, struggling to maintain fifth place.\nSo...\n\"I have to say, the logistics team really put a lot of thought into this battlefield design.\"\n\"Indeed. Look at the building quality—they even have damn plaques?\"\nThe four members of the Snow Wolf Group marveled at the completely lifelike urban battlefield, like Granny Liu entering the Grand View Gardens.\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the city streets, members of the Black Tiger Group also commented, \"As a battlefield, it feels a bit of a pity to destroy this place, doesn’t it?\"\nThe leader of the Black Tiger Group chuckled, \"Well, you don’t need to worry about that. I estimate that no other groups will come here for a short time, so this place shouldn’t serve as a battlefield...\"\nHe was brimming with confidence, believing all other groups had already left to search the outskirts for the Forest Wolf Troop.\nThat was until he turned his head and encountered the four members of the Snow Wolf Group at the next street corner, less than a hundred meters away.\nAll seven people stared at each other for a full two seconds. The atmosphere suddenly grew silent and somewhat awkward.\nThe three from the Black Tiger Group glanced at the Cold Water Wolf beside the four Snow Wolf Group members. The four from the Snow Wolf Group, in turn, noted the Netherworld Demon Tiger next to the three Black Tiger Group members.\nThey all pursed their lips. Then, without a single unnecessary word, darkness enveloped the entire street.\nThe next moment, a cold fog, thick with terrifying toxins and chilling air, spread out!\n\"Damn it! Weren’t you Black Tiger Group guys searching for the Forest Wolf Troop to the southeast? How did you end up here?\" Snow Wolf Group’s Leader Ling cursed angrily. \"You’re despicable! So you were trying to rush us into a suicidal mission while you waited here to reap the rewards like a fisherman?\"\n\"Pah! You have the nerve to blame me? Weren’t you quick to respond too? Cut the crap and die!\" Mo He was also furious.\nI just finished boasting to my team, and this bunch pops out of nowhere! Aren’t they deliberately trying to annoy me, Commander Mo He!?\nHowever, just as the battle was about to erupt, Mo He keenly sensed that something was amiss. Unfortunately, in this situation, it was impossible to pause and reconsider.\nThe corrosive cold fog and spreading shadows instantly reduced the newly constructed city to ruins. The solid concrete and the buildings sculpted by Earth-type Pet Beasts proved incredibly fragile under the bombardment of Commander Level Pet Beasts!\nSure enough!\nBlack lines formed on the foreheads of everyone watching the live broadcast. This was really awkward, wasn’t it?\nThe Chief of the Tiger C Division and Lin Lei of the War Wolf Division especially felt helpless. Through their god’s-eye view, they could clearly see that it wasn’t just their own ace teams; at that moment, quite a few others were also hurrying toward this location.\nBut undeniably, in such a chaotic battle, the one to make the first move would inevitably become the victim of latecomers waiting to pounce.\nThe Snow Wolf Group’s Cold Water Wolf was one thing, but the Netherworld Demon Tiger was currently ranked number one! It represented the pride and the strongest fighting force of the Tiger Division this time! If they were to meet a grim end under these circumstances, forget number one; even securing a spot in the top three would be uncertain.\nHowever, just then, the Tiger Division Chief’s expression turned even uglier, while Lin Lei’s eyes lit up slightly.\nBecause at that moment, several figures approached rapidly from afar—the third team to arrive on the battlefield!\nThe classic scenario of a three-way confrontation, while perhaps manifesting differently in Blue Star’s Beastmaster Society, was essentially unfolding.\nIndeed, just then, on the other side of the street, a third party suddenly appeared.\nMore importantly, this third party was the very target they were all hunting:\nThe Forest Wolf Troop!\nThe two sides, moments ago fiercely at odds, halted abruptly. They unanimously turned their gaze toward the arriving Forest Wolf Troop.\nLi Da, seeing the situation unfold, understood it perfectly and couldn’t help but give a wry smile.\nYou cunning dogs, truly treacherous!\nAt the same time, he also felt somewhat helpless.\nWhat rotten luck. Our fight had just begun and hadn’t made much noise. Moreover, we never expected anyone else besides our Forest Wolf Troop to be in the battlefield’s center—and two teams at that!\nBut now that they’d been seen, there was no need to continue hiding.\nSo, Li Da smiled faintly, putting on an excited expression, and said, \"Leader Ling, we’re both comrades from the War Wolf Division! Never mind other things for now. Let’s first eliminate this bunch from the Tiger Division, and then we can have a fair showdown. What do you say?\"",

A Brutal Contest!_2\nThe captain of the Snow Wolf Group’s eyes flickered, casting an ill-intentioned glance towards Mo He and the three Netherworld Demon Tigers.\nThen, without a second thought, Mo He smacked one of the Netherworld Demon Tigers on the head and turned tail to run.\n\"ROAR!\"\nThe sound of the tiger’s roar echoed instantly in the very center of the battlefield.\nLi Da and Captain Ling’s complexions changed almost simultaneously.\nBut their reactions were starkly different!\nCaptain Ling signaled the rest of the Snow Wolf Group members with his eyes and also turned to flee.\nLi Da, along with Da Zhuang and the other four Wanmu Wolves at his side, instantly activated their Skills!\nThe next moment, trees grew rapidly from the buildings and houses surrounding the street they were on, spreading out like tentacles.\nThis tiger’s roar was too shocking.\nThe entire small city, as well as its vicinity, could hear it crystal clear.\nOriginally, all the teams had almost converged on this central battlefield. Despite varying distances, they were all racing at full speed where every second counted, so none were far from the small city.\nThis tiger’s roar made it clear to everyone that within this small city, they weren’t the only ones who thought this way!\nRather, everyone had the same idea, and more importantly, the final battle had already begun!\nAt this moment, after a brief hesitation, everyone again issued their orders!\nAdvance into the city!\nSince they had already come, continuing to keep their heads down and run would only earn them those few points. If they could fish in troubled waters and snatch a few kills, it would be far better than anything.\nAs everyone entered the city, they were stunned by the scene unfolding before them.\nForests!\nThe area was densely packed with towering trees that seemed to cover everything!\nThe very center of what used to be a small city had been transformed into a forest in this short period of time!\nWas this the ability of the Forest Wolf Troop?\nAt this moment, everyone felt both relieved and dumbfounded.\nThey felt relieved, truly glad they hadn’t used their depleted forces to search for the Forest Wolf Troop earlier, and even more so that they hadn’t run into them before this moment.\nEven Mo He, leader of the Black Tiger Group, who had sidestepped the forming coalition between the Snow Wolf Group and Forest Wolf Troop, couldn’t help but take a sharp breath at the sight of the approaching forest deluge.\n\"This is just too absurd, right?\"\n\"Indeed, absurd!\"\nA voice rang out not far away, and Mo He jerked, hurriedly looking in that direction.\nSure enough, atop a nearby building, another figure appeared.\nThe captain of the Shadow Leopard Group!\n\"Old Deng, how about we make a deal? Let’s deal with the Forest Wolf Troop first. How about it? You’ve seen the ability of the Forest Wolf Troop! You wouldn’t want to hand over first place so easily, would you? After dealing with the Forest Wolf Troop, we can fight it out fair and square!\"\nThe four members of the Shadow Leopard Group cast a glance their way and, after pondering for a bit, nodded in agreement.\nThis wasn’t an isolated case; it was a widespread consensus.\nNone of the warband members could have anticipated that their previous hunts for the Forest Wolf Troop, each driven by their own agenda, would actually lead to a consensus upon their arrival at the battlefield’s center and in the face of this surging forest flood!\nExcept for the Snow Wolf Group, which elected not to join forces due to being from the same division as the Forest Wolf Troop, every other team that entered the center of the battlefield now had the same preliminary goal.\nEliminate the Forest Wolf Troop first.\nMeanwhile, the Snow Wolf Group members in the forest were rather bewildered.\n\"Captain, what do we do now?\"\nThe sudden turn of events left Captain Ling somewhat unprepared.\nThey truly had wanted to cooperate with the other teams to eliminate the Forest Wolf Troop, which occupied the strongest position at the center.\nBut damn it, apart from the others not trusting them, he was also afraid of being beaten by the group leader and Chief Lin if he went out.\nThis was a conflict between groups, true. But the honor belonged to the division! Helping outsiders attack one’s own people was nothing but outright suicide.\nSo, Captain Ling exhaled, \"Damn it, these sons of bitches are pushing it too far! With so many people targeting the Forest Wolf Troop, since no one trusts us, then let’s back up our brothers! But remember, don’t get too stubborn about it! Let the Forest Wolf Troop take the initiative!\"\n\"Yes, sir!\"\nAt this moment, the entire battlefield was on the brink of chaotic combat.\nOutside the arena, Chief Lin was the first to lose his composure, \"Old Luo, can your Tiger Division even play fairly? Starting to use alliances and strategies in a martial competition?\"\n\"To hell with you, who said we can’t? The principle of Legion combat is to unite all who can be united! Who asked your War Wolf Division to be the ones sticking their necks out?\"\nThe quarrel between the two division chiefs wasn’t of much concern to others.\nAt this moment, everyone’s eyes were firmly glued to the live broadcast on the screen.\nEven Su Ping found it tough; despite having the Solar Script, standing out in such a situation proved to be extremely difficult.\nBut, under these circumstances, eliminating the Wanmu Wolves was definitely not going to be an easy feat.\nSu Ping expected that in this woven forest, facing Wanmu Wolves that had quickly gained an absolute geographical advantage, several Pet Beast enemies of the same Level would struggle to threaten even one.\nSo dishonorable! Utterly dishonorable.\nAt this moment, this was the only thought in the minds of the entire Forest Wolf Troop at the heart of the battlefield.\nHowever, Li Da, as the captain and commander, had already made his deployments in the first instance!",

A Brutal Contest!_3\n\"Go to the highest point of the forest with your Wanmu Wolves,\" Su Ping commanded. \"Absorb as much sunlight as possible, ensure your safety as Beast Tamers, conserve your energy and stamina, and stop creating forest torrents! When you face the enemy, you must eliminate them with utmost speed, focusing primarily on their Beast Tamers!\"\n\"Also, don’t stick together. For now, take positions on the roofs of the four high-rise buildings at the southeast, southwest, northeast, and northwest corners. You will traverse through the air. I will stay here, connecting the spreading trees from this very spot!\"\n\"Yes, sir!\"\nFollowing these commands, the members of the Forest Wolf Troop on the rooftops leaped down without a second thought.\nAlmost at the instant they jumped, wooden structures materialized, transforming into bridges of wood that arched through the sky.\nOnce again, with incredible proficiency, they wove the sky above the small town into a green web!\nThis is terrifying!\nAlmost all the teams couldn’t help but raise their heads to look at the spreading branches in the sky. These branches connected with the ten-story buildings of the town, forming a Tree Prison that trapped them inside!\nThis is the real Tree Prison! No, this is the true Advent of the Tree Realm! The Tree Realm Prison!\nExcitement beyond belief shone in Su Ping’s eyes!\nThough the town was indeed very small—it was questionable if it even spanned three kilometers from end to end. After all, only about twenty buildings stood there. It could hardly be called a town; if anything, it was merely a residential complex.\nBut one had to remember, these were only five Wanmu Wolves for now!\nWhat if in the future... if I cultivated a few dozen Wanmu Wolves to serve as ’battlefield controllers,’ supplemented by main attackers and a logistics team responsible for healing? If a complete iron triangle were formed, could this legion perhaps disregard the threat of Beast Tides numbering in the hundreds or thousands?\nIt seemed this was indeed the case!\nWith little concern for energy consumption, once the Tree Realm Prison enveloped the sky, every piece of wood fell under the Wanmu Wolves’ control. They didn’t need to attack other troublesome Pet Beasts. Instead, they utilized their near-limitless agility within this jungle. Able to traverse the woods at will, even move along the tops of trees to achieve an effect akin to ’flying,’ their assaults on the Beast Tamers were impossible to defend against!\nThus, as the chaotic battle commenced, messages began to flood the leaderboard!\n[Forest Wolf Troop’s Sun Xiao has eliminated ’Zhang Bing’ of the White Tiger Group, gaining +1 Point...]\n[Forest Wolf Troop’s Gao Hang has eliminated ’Li Tie’ of the Iron Arm Ape Group, gaining +1 Point...]\n[...]\nAt a speed no one could have imagined.\nIn this vast jungle, it seemed they were the ones being hunted.\nThe Forest Wolf Troop, which had previously fallen to third place, surged back to the top in just one short hour!\nWhat were they to do!?\nAt this moment, everyone felt paralyzed.\nHowever, soon, a crucial piece of news acted like a shot in the arm for everyone who had started to lose hope.\n\"Captain, look! The Forest Wolf Troop has suffered casualties!\"\nThat’s right. After an hour of such chaotic fighting, the Forest Wolf Troop was not truly invincible after all.\nCasualties had finally appeared.\nIt was Xiao Can, one of the five. His Wanmu Wolf was only a Commander Sixth Order.\nBut that wasn’t the true reason!\n\"Fire Type Pet Beasts, the natural nemesis of the Wanmu Wolves, have arrived!\"\nEveryone who had witnessed the recent events was discussing it animatedly.\nIndeed, Xiao Can’s elimination was at the hands of the flame gorilla currently standing atop a building.\nThis year’s grand competition was undoubtedly the worst for the Ape Masters. Trouble seemed inevitable for them once they returned.\nHowever, perhaps due to the Forest Wolf Troop’s luck, almost all the Fire Type Pet Beasts from the various divisions had been nearly wiped out.\nEven the Ashen Wolf Lord of the War Wolf Division was no exception.\nHence, no Fire Type Pet Beasts had appeared until now.\nWho would have thought that the Ape Troop would have a lone survivor!\nThis single remaining flame gorilla became the hope for breaking the deadlock!\nThe elimination of a single Wanmu Wolf instantly created a gap in the Tree Realm Prison that had enveloped the small town.\n\"Protect that flame gorilla!\" someone roared, and then they all rallied together.\nAt this moment, they seemed to have truly disregarded their own scores!\nTheir sole objective was to eliminate the Forest Wolf Troop!\nOtherwise, even if they achieved other decent rankings and points in this competition, their honor would be utterly lost!\nThe Forest Wolf Troop must be eliminated!\nAnd at this crucial juncture, the arriving flame gorilla became the key to turning the tables.\nThe wood, now charred by flames, prevented the Wanmu Wolves from drawing power from it to sustain themselves.\nMoreover, the interconnected trees, usually their strength, now became a deadly weakness under the blaze, helping the fire spread rapidly!\nFlame Gorilla!\nLi Da’s eyes were bloodshot; they had already accumulated a significant number of points.\nAfter brawling for nearly the entire morning, everyone was practically consumed by battle frenzy.\nBut their stamina and Energy had been severely depleted.\nHowever, while they were expending stamina and Energy, their enemies were losing their lives!\nIn just that morning, both the Black Tiger Group and the Shadow Leopard Group had each suffered one or two casualties.\nAnd all the Titan Pythons of the Great Serpent Master had been completely eliminated!",

A Brutal Contest!_4\nSo, if they wanted to win, they had to kill that Flame Gorilla.\nUnfortunately, during the morning’s fierce battle, three of the Cold Water Wolves from the Snow Wolf Group—a natural counter to the Flame Gorilla—had been eliminated, leaving only one shivering in fear.\nThey had to kill that Flame Gorilla!\nLi Da knew that if they didn’t kill the Flame Gorilla, which was rampaging through the Tree Realm Prison under everyone’s protection, his side would definitely be annihilated!\nHe knew he had to make a move now.\nBecause in just a short time, the Forest Wolf Troop, originally of five, was now down to just him and Sun Xiao.\nThese bastards surrounding the Flame Gorilla made it impossible for them to break out and assassinate it.\nBut waiting here would only lead to death in the end.\nSun Xiao and Li Da stood together and, in just a moment, confirmed their tactics.\nThus, Li Da made his move. It was the first time he used his Talented Ability: a very simple gift called Mirror Heaven Reflection.\nIt was an abstract ability that could change his own appearance or that of a Beast Tamer.\nIt seemed simple and apparently useless for Pet Beast cultivation, but it could play a critical role at crucial moments. For example, right now...\n...in the instant the ability activated, Da Zhuang, who was in front of them, slowly shifted from his Wanmu Wolf form, transforming into Li Da’s appearance. Meanwhile, Li Da himself slowly turned into a Wanmu Wolf, completely inverting the roles between master and servant.\nAnd in the next moment, Sun Xiao, controlling Er Zhuang, gave chase, shouting, \"You curs! Have you no shame?\"\nThe intensity of the battle reached an unimaginable fever pitch. Now, with the tactical triumph and stroke of genius against the Flame Gorilla, Mo He, the captain of the Black Tiger Group, couldn’t help but smirk.\n\"This time, I admit the Forest Wolf Troop has won,\" Mo He said, \"but if you think you can make us lose this embarrassingly, you’re mistaken!\"\nWith that thought, Mo He narrowed his eyes.\n\"Go, someone tie this guy up! Old Lu, keep controlling the Flame Gorilla to sweep through this area. This brat is just trying to lure the tiger away from the mountain. Don’t be fooled by him.\"\nThe others nodded. Old Deng, the aloof commander from the Shadow Leopard Group, immediately went forward. His Soul-Eating Leopard’s psychic influence instantly activated, causing the swiftly fleeing Er Zhuang to stagger. The psychic attack nearly made it fall from the tree.\nThe horror of the Psychic Element lay in its silent, imperceptible activation, making it impossible to guard against. However, forming a Psychic Ability was extremely difficult, and its attack power was relatively low.\nAs long as they didn’t catch the Beast Tamer, such an attack was nothing to Er Zhuang.\nThen, in the next moment, on the frontline, another Wanmu Wolf suddenly appeared in the forest woven by Li Da.\n\"Hahaha, Old Li, it seems you’re nearby, ready to assault the Flame Gorilla? Don’t waste your energy!\"\nWith both Wanmu Wolves in play, Mo He finally stopped hesitating. This meant that the Forest Wolf Troop had reached the end of their rope.\nAlthough their own losses were greater—greater beyond imagination—just being able to eliminate the Forest Wolf Troop was enough. Otherwise, it would be too shameful!\n\"Still want to run? Chase them!\" Mo He ordered. \"Additionally, Old He, you take Old Lu and the Flame Gorilla to sweep through these woods and flush out Old Li, who’s unwilling to emerge from within.\"\n\"The rest of you, chase! Contain this Forest Wolf. Once we’ve dealt with this one, the remaining one will be easy to handle!\"\nMo He took the lead, riding atop his Netherworld Demon Tiger. With a leap over the treetops, he headed straight for the Wanmu Wolf not far away.\nThe Wanmu Wolf was still running ahead, but Mo He, closely followed by another Beast Tamer from the Shadow Leopard Group, was rapidly closing in on the swiftly fleeing creature.\nAt that moment, an ominous premonition suddenly struck Mo He.\nHe looked at this Forest Wolf Evolver and felt something was off.\nWhat was strange about it?\nMo He quickly figured it out: the opponent was too slow.\nWas it deliberately waiting for them, or was there another reason? Could there be a trap?!\nMo He slowed his pace, warily scouring the surroundings. The Flame Gorilla’s fire had spread along the branches, adding a brilliant streak of flame to the battlefield, which was shrouded in dark clouds!\nLi Da helplessly looked up at the sky. At this moment, he damn well wanted to inexplicably cry out, \"Oh, vast heavens, why treat me so unjustly?\"\nIf there were still sunlight in this final opportunity, and if they could eliminate the Flame Gorilla, the Forest Wolf Troop would still have a chance to turn the tables. But now, that chance was slim.\nHowever... A resolute light flashed in Li Da’s eyes.\nRegardless of the situation, his priority was to eliminate that annoying Flame Gorilla.\nAWOO~\nA piercing howl sounded from not far away. Li Da’s mouth curled into a smile, while Mo He turned his head in disbelief, looking towards a distant place.\nThat was where Old Lu, the Flame Gorilla, and another Netherworld Demon Tiger were searching for Li Da!\nHow could this be?\nThe first Forest Wolf was restrained by Old Deng’s Soul-Eating Leopard, and the second Forest Wolf was right in front of them.\nCould it be that Old Ling, the remaining member of the Snow Wolf Group, had made a comeback?!\nBut in the next moment, he knew the answer. The Forest Wolf before him slowly revealed its illusory form. Under the Netherworld Demon Tiger’s clutches, the life indicator on his wristwatch burst into light.\n[Forest Wolf Troop member Li Da, you have been eliminated. Current Forest Wolf Troop points: 101. Please immediately restrain your Pet Beast and either wait on-site or evacuate the battlefield!]\nEliminated!\nIn just a morning’s chaotic battle, the Forest Wolf Troop was left with only Sun Xiao and Er Zhuang, a Wanmu Wolf, still struggling to hold on.\nBut Li Da was content. Through the Soul Contract, he could clearly sense that his Da Zhuang had not only taken out the Flame Gorilla’s Beast Tamer but had also eliminated the Beast Tamer of the last remaining Netherworld Demon Tiger, apart from Mo He.\nThis transformed ambush had resulted in an unimaginable victory!\n\"The rest is up to you now, Old Sun!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 185: Chapter 134 The Last Glimmer of Light! The Mutated Wanmu Wolf!\nTSK.\nSu Ping shook his head involuntarily as he watched the tragic scenes unfolding on the screen. He knew that this was probably the end of the line for the Forest Wolf Troop’s final battle.\nWith Li Da eliminated, even though Sun Xiao and Er Zhuang were still left, several other opponents remained. And these guys, they were all seeing red.\nThey had to eliminate the entire Forest Wolf Troop.\nEven without the Flame Gorilla, Su Ping knew that under the current circumstances, Er Zhuang and Sun Xiao wouldn’t last much longer.\nThe reason was simple. Beyond the physical and mental burden from continuously using the Sunlight Absorption Formula, the most crucial factor was the current situation: dark clouds now obscured the sun.\nIf the sun were still out, with boundless sunlight available, they might still have a chance. But now, that was clearly gone.\nWith Er Zhuang’s three Sunlight Absorption Formula skills—Sunlight Absorption, Photosynthesis, and Heart of Woods—all reaching Master Level, the burden he bore was indeed somewhat less than that of the other Wanmu Wolves.\nBut without direct sunlight, it was useless! Even the most skilled artisan can’t work without materials!\nThus, the Flame Gorilla was just the last straw that broke the camel’s back. But that was enough.\nAround him, after witnessing the chaotic battle that morning, everyone looked at Su Ping with pure amazement.\nEven in this situation, it was clear the Wanmu Wolf had weaknesses. Its vulnerability to fire was particularly obvious, and it lacked direct, high-damage offensive skills, focusing more on crowd control and versatile development. But what other Commander Level Pet Beast, focused on raw power, could achieve such results? Clearly, none! And because there were none, was it reasonable to demand that the Wanmu Wolf also possess even greater offensive power under these circumstances? That was clearly asking too much.\nEven Vice President Liu, who was beside him, let out a long breath and said, \"You really gave me a big surprise, kid!\"\nIndeed, it was a big surprise!\nA Wanmu Wolf like this, if it participated in the Breeder Contest... it might not be guaranteed to take first place, but it would definitely have a very high chance. Although this wasn’t a low-level evolution that could be easily popularized due to certain breeding costs, compared to those costs, the Wanmu Wolf’s potential was well worth it.\nAfter a pause, Old Liu continued confidently, \"When we get back to the association, I’ll keep my promise and personally apply for your Senior Breeder certificate for specializing in Forest Wolf!\"\nOld Liu had never, ever imagined this. He never imagined his earlier prediction would come true so quickly.\nSu Ping smiled slightly. He wasn’t particularly concerned about these matters but was, instead, quite curious about the Breeder Contest. \"There’s no rush for that, President Liu,\" he asked. \"When exactly is this year’s Breeder Association conference held?\"\nLiu Fuhai replied without even thinking, \"You haven’t paid any attention to it before, have you? It’s held every year after New Year’s Day and before Chinese New Year’s Eve. Usually, it’s all over in one day. After all, the Dragon Nation has over twenty provinces. If each province takes about ten minutes or so to present their achievements, that’s sufficient. There’s no need to fully disclose the findings, just to demonstrate the experimental process, breeding insights, and the final product!\"\nSu Ping blinked. \"I see. I thought the results and breeding methods had to be completely shared with all viewers to qualify!\"\nVice President Liu chuckled. \"You wouldn’t believe it, but the original Breeder Contests indeed aimed for that. However, in doing so, breeders would hoard their secrets, and not many wanted to share publicly! Think about it, who would be willing to give away their hard-researched methods to other breeders for free? Moreover, it was later discovered that this approach wasn’t ideal. It could lead to price crashes for items and Pet Beasts, not to mention potentially causing localized unrest. Ultimately, the drawbacks outweighed the benefits.\nOur Dragon Nation does have a patent fee system. However, it’s still difficult to manage such situations perfectly with that alone, so the requirements for sharing aren’t too strict here. As I mentioned, you can choose to submit your breeding method to the association. In return, the association will give you a large number of academic credits all at once! You might even receive rarer, more valuable designated resources. Additionally, any Breeder who obtains your breeding method through the association will pay you a significant share of their academic credits as a patent fee! Furthermore, breeding methods obtained from the association are strictly prohibited from being shared further; this is mandated by law. Of course, even with laws and the requirement to sign Soul Contracts, truly enforcing strict prohibition can sometimes be difficult.\"\nVice President Liu clarified the pros and cons. Su Ping nodded.\nHe was already aware of these subsequent details. But Vice President Liu was right. Human nature is inherently selfish; no one is willing to share their researched breeding methods for nothing. That’s why powerful Beast Tamers in the Secret Realms would choose to pass on their breeding methods as a legacy before their death. This was true in ancient times, and it hasn’t changed much in the modern era either.\nVice President Liu glanced at Su Ping. Just as with the Heart of Woods, he didn’t insist on anything from him, and said with a smile,",

You don’t need to overthink it.\"\nSu Ping nodded. \"A day’s time is easy to spare, but I need to visit the Magic Capital. I don’t want it to delay my trip.\"\n\"The Magic Capital?\"\nVice President Liu was slightly startled, then asked eagerly, \"Is it Xiao Xue from the Qin Family who’s asking you to go?\"\nSu Ping nodded.\nHe had told Qin Xiaoxue about Woodhead’s Evolution before. When it evolved into the Crown Wolf Emperor, he was to witness it with his own eyes.\nGetting the confirmation, Vice President Liu then squinted and smiled slightly. \"Then you don’t need to worry. This year’s Breeder Conference will be held in the Magic Capital...\"\n\"Ah?\"\nSu Ping was engaged in a lively chat with Vice President Liu, while on the battlefield, the situation was still just as heated. Unfortunately, it wasn’t as relaxed as it was for them.\nSun Xiao had already sustained a few minor injuries. They weren’t from attacks, but purely from cuts by branches and leaves as he jumped quickly through the forest. However, now was not the time to worry about these minor wounds.\nSun Xiao looked helplessly at Er Zhuang panting heavily beside him, and at those damn sons of turtles that had trapped him in a corner with no escape.\n\"You bunch of bastards, winning without honor!\"\n\"Commander Sun, the adult world only looks at outcomes, not processes.\"\nMo He’s expression was indifferent, but\nhis heart was bleeding.\nDamn it! The Forest Wolf Troop’s Sun Xiao is now a lone commander. Where exactly has his Black Tiger Group’s strength gone? And now, he too is the only surviving captain of the Black Tiger Group.\nThe chaos of the morning’s battles, chasing the Forest Wolf Troop within these tree prison confines, had indeed killed four of their men, but the losses suffered by the other teams were many times greater.\nWithout a doubt, the Forest Wolf Troop has become the brightest star in this competition. Even if they aren’t first, they are certainly the most noticed and praised, because their defeat was not shameful.\nBesides, with the current situation, the likelihood of the Forest Wolf Troop not taking first place is slim, unless they play dirty and don’t continue fighting, choosing to just chat until the poison circle closes in and they earn a huge load of survival Points. Only in that case would it be possible to completely overtake the Forest Wolf Troop, which is already far ahead from the morning.\nBut is that possible? Wouldn’t it be shameful? At this point, aside from the Forest Wolf Troop winning first place, no other team has the gall to claim it.\nHowever, thankfully, no matter what, they’ve finally cornered the Forest Wolf Troop. Otherwise, apart from the Battle Wolf A Division, the other divisions would really have no face left.\nThinking of this, Mo He’s eyes turned stern, and he didn’t hesitate anymore. \"Brothers, get ready!\"\nAlthough he wasn’t everyone’s captain, Mo He had indeed been the one leading the hunt to annihilate the Forest Wolf Troop.\nNow is not the time to hesitate. In a corner like this, where the Forest Wolf Troop has no escape, we’ll attack together. We just need to eliminate this damned Forest Wolf that has thoroughly disrupted the Legion Grand Tournament, and that will be it!\nSun Xiao looked helplessly at the pouncing Netherworld Demon Tiger, Soul-eating Leopard, Demonic Shadow Leopard, Biyun Baboon, and Cloud-Patterned Tree Python, feeling somewhat resigned.\nAmong them, the Biyun Baboon and Cloud-Patterned Tree Python are both Wood Element Pet Beasts. It’s quite apparent that in this kind of jungle, besides their strong Racial Potential, Wood Element Pet Beasts have relatively stronger self-preservation abilities.\nDamn it, no martial ethics! Er Zhuang barely has any Energy left to continue the upcoming battle. And these damn sons of turtles are attacking together!\nSun Xiao’s eyes darted. \"Commander Deng, among those who are left, after my Forest Wolf Troop is out, it will be your Shadow Leopard Group with only two combatants left. I’m afraid after they eliminate me, it will be your turn to suffer! How about we join forces, eliminate them first, and then I’ll willingly concede the championship to you? What do you say?\"\nAs soon as these words were spoken, everyone’s gaze immediately turned to Commander Deng, but the latter simply said, \"No need. Among us who are left, there’s no winner. Eliminating the Forest Wolf Troop first is the best outcome.\"\n\"HUMPH! Still trying to sow discord? Go to hell!\"\n\"ROAR!\"\nThe Netherworld Demon Tiger roared and pounced straight towards Sun Xiao. Resigned, Sun Xiao took out his life signs watch.\nHowever, just as he was about to trigger the life signs watch, a piercing howl came from the side!\n\"AWOOO!\"\nThe Wolf Howl made Sun Xiao pause. He looked towards his own Pet Beast.\nClearly, the Wolf Tribe is the most arrogant Pet Beast Race. Such Wolf Tribe Pet Beasts would not accept conceding without a final, desperate battle.\nSo, sensing its master’s gaze and the approaching ferocious tiger, Er Zhuang still moved!\nEven without the Sun to activate the Solar Formula for Rapid Recovery of its strength, Er Zhuang’s body was not completely drained. It still possessed a Wood body, the sharpest of claws and fangs, and...\nAt that moment, a light shone forth. The pouncing Netherworld Demon Tiger and Biyun Baboon both experienced a blinding flash, as if a powerful light threatened to sear their eyes.\nSubsequently, it was a different story for the Netherworld Demon Tiger. The power of its Dark Element was clearly demonstrated, as the Blinding Technique had an extremely minimal effect on it.",

A bright light flashed before it, blinding it completely. Erzhuang, ignoring the other Pet Beasts, charged straight forward, its sharp claws landing directly on the Biyun Baboon’s body.\nIts claws pierced several bloody holes. Then, with a final surge of Energy, entwining branches formed Wood Spikes and thorny vines, shooting straight for the Biyun Baboon’s Beast Tamer!\n[Tree Ape Troop member: Cheng Yuan, you have been eliminated. Current Tree Ape Troop Points: 72. Please immediately restrain your Pet Beast and wait on site or withdraw from the battlefield!]\nAt this final moment, another Beast Tamer was eliminated?\nWith the Tree Ape Troop’s leader’s face turning even darker, everyone else’s expression became priceless.\n\"Damn it, how many more tricks does this Forest Wolf’s Evolutionary Body have up its sleeve? Another Skill has popped up; what is this Skill now?\"\n\"Blinding? Creating a bright light to blind the enemy to some extent.\"\n\"What? Isn’t this Skill unique to special Attribute Light Series Pet Beasts? How come Nature Type ones have it?\"\n\"Who knows? If someone had told you before that the Forest Wolf Troop could win the championship in the tournament, would you have believed it?\"\n\"True, damn, that Breeder kid is a freak.\"\n\"Luckily, it’s finally over.\"\nEven if they could ultimately eliminate that Biyun Baboon, the final outcome would still remain unchanged. And that was indeed the case.\nSun Xiao managed to evade the Pet Beasts’ attack trajectories with several quick dodges. However, it was obvious that Erzhuang, having fought strenuously to protect its master, was now covered in wounds.\nEven on its chest, there were wounds deep enough to expose bone.\nIt was over!\nEven Sun Xiao thought so.\nBecause not only was Erzhuang exhausted, but he, too, had no strength left to dodge. Although a Beast Tamer’s physical strength was much greater than that of an ordinary person, they did not rely on this for their livelihood. Not to mention Erzhuang’s current state.\nHowever, this time Sun Xiao did not attempt to activate his Life-Signs Watch preemptively.\nIf Erzhuang wished to die standing, then so be it; let the opponent’s attack decide!\nAnd so, Sun Xiao went directly to the side of Erzhuang, who was panting heavily. He gently rubbed its eyelids, which were so heavy they seemed to fight to stay open, as Erzhuang continuously let out whimpering sounds.\nThen, facing the surging dark tide from the Netherworld Demon Tiger, Sun Xiao closed his eyes.\nHowever, after waiting a full three seconds, the voice from the Life-Signs Watch announcing elimination, which Sun Xiao had been expecting, never came.\nHe opened his eyes in astonishment, only to freeze slightly in surprise.\nErzhuang’s body was standing in front of him.\nObviously, such a competition would not involve life and death; his own Pet Beast understood this clearly. So, the kind of touching scene often witnessed on real battlefields—a pet beast senselessly blocking a fatal blow for its master—would never occur in a competition like this.\nSo, what did this mean?\nWhat was happening?\nNot only Sun Xiao but also Mo He and the other team members were dumbfounded. Everyone watching the scene unfold on the live broadcast was equally shocked.\nWas it really necessary?\nIt’s just a competition, not a fight to the death; was such a gesture necessary?\nBesides, even if it blocked one attack, the final outcome wouldn’t change, right?\nEven Su Ping blinked. Subconsciously, he felt a bit anxious.\nDamn it, could there have been a problem with his training and Cultivation before?\nHad he not trained Erzhuang properly, causing it to become rigid and wooden-headed at this moment?\nIf so, it was possible that Erzhuang had failed to grasp reality, its mind becoming dull.\nThe question was, the other Wanmu Wolves didn’t have this issue, and they all trained together. Could it be that Erzhuang had done fewer math problems or skimped on its training?\nSu Ping’s heart drummed with unease.\nHowever, the next moment brought a sudden turn!\nOn the huge live broadcast screen, the Wanmu Wolf standing before Sun Xiao slowly began to emit a glow. It started from the Y-shaped antlers on its head; they lit up as if electrified, resembling two incandescent columns of light!\nIn the next moment, to everyone’s utter astonishment, it seemed as if a ray of sunshine had pierced through the dark clouds—which weren’t actually all that thick—in the overcast Sky Dome, shining down upon Erzhuang.\nIn this dim world, from this seemingly insignificant little wolf, a final, faint glimmer of light seemed to bloom.\nSu Ping seemed to suddenly realize something, his eyes widening. Incredulously, he stared at the scene unfolding on the screen.",

At this moment, everyone’s eyes were wide, staring at the scene unfolding before them. They watched the Wanmu Wolf, cornered and facing imminent doom, to see what kind of last-resort card it could still play, what kind of trick it could pull off at this critical juncture.\nClearly, they believed the Wanmu Wolf still had some unknown skills up its sleeve, which it had chosen this moment to finally use. But at this instant, perhaps only Su Ping might have guessed what was truly happening, what the situation entailed. However, at this time, he naturally had no leisure or mood to explain anything to the others. Unblinkingly, he focused on the dramatic scene playing out on the screen.\nLight! Er Zhuang’s transformation at this moment was startling. Not only Sun Xiao but even Mo He and the others in front of him were dumbfounded. Then, almost in that very instant, everyone, including the Netherworld Demon Tiger that had just been attacking, decisively chose to flee! There was no choice. The closer it came to this moment, the more cautious they had to be. Previously, they had witnessed the uncanny and terrifying capabilities of this Forest Wolf Evolver. Not to mention, the extent of the Tree Realm Prison and those seemingly conjured-from-thin-air skills had truly left them somewhat PTSD-stricken. So, upon seeing that the Forest Wolf Evolver had undergone another strange change, their first reaction was to beat a hasty retreat.\nAs it turned out, had they made the right choice again?\nEr Zhuang, at this moment, looked so different that even Sun Xiao blinked in confusion, a sense of unfamiliarity washing over him. Even the other members of the Forest Wolf Troop, who had been moved from the battlefield but allowed to continue watching, blurted out astonished curses, staring at the screen in disbelief. Because at this moment, Er Zhuang seemed utterly foreign to them.\nThe Wanmu Wolf was already quite extraordinary, especially in terms of appearance. The Y-shaped antlers resembling tree branches and the foliage-like fur draped all over it meant that if one didn’t look at its head, it hardly resembled a Wolf Pet anymore. While not exactly imposing or dominating, it possessed an indescribable sense of depth and substance.\nBut at this instant, Er Zhuang, before everyone’s eyes, transformed yet again. A bright light, starting from its antlers, spread all over its body. The Wanmu Wolf, at this moment, connected with the singular, faint ray of sunlight pouring down from the sky and burst into a gentle glow. This glow wasn’t like the effect of a Blinding Technique. It was soft, yet it permeated its entire body with light. Its body seemed to become translucent, and the draping branch-like fur turned into a fusion of gold and white—a color reminiscent of white gold. Even its eyes turned slightly pale.\nLooking at the Wanmu Wolf before them, their own Er Zhuang, Sun Xiao was bewildered. Su Ping was also bewildered. All the eliminated warriors were bewildered. Except for Li Da, who hadn’t yet been evacuated from the field, the Forest Wolf Troop’s other three members were also stunned.\nWhat the hell was all this?\nDid their own Forest Wolf have this skill?\nThey hadn’t heard Breeder Su mention this before!\nEven they had no idea what capabilities it possessed in this state. But, without a doubt, such a dramatic transformation, once it occurred, was definitely not for show.\nIndeed, this seemed to be the case. Sun Xiao stared at Er Zhuang before him. However, Er Zhuang was not looking back at its master, Sun Xiao. Instead, its gaze was directed towards the other Beast Tamers and their Pet Beasts who had fled into the building.\nIn that moment, the Wanmu Wolf, enveloped by the only sliver of available sunlight, seemed to be the sole protagonist spotlighted on a pitch-dark stage. Above in the sky, a streak of golden light from behind the clouds connected with Er Zhuang.\nThe entire legion, including Zhao Deguang and the general beside him, were intently watching the solitary figure on the screen. They also wanted to see what other tricks this peculiar Forest Wolf Evolver could pull off at such a time. And the outcome did not disappoint them.\nEr Zhuang’s slightly pale eyes let out a very deep, whining sound. Suddenly, a radiance as brilliant as the break of dawn surged from the antlered branches atop its head, striking directly towards the building where the remaining Beast Tamers had hidden!\nThe spectacle was beyond description! Su Ping, with his 82 points in the Chinese language college entrance examination from his previous life, found himself unable to articulate the scene before his eyes.\nThe light instantaneously illuminated the entire broadcast. This was true for Sun Xiao’s live feed and for the views of other Beast Tamers looking their way. An endless radiance, as if a miniature sun had burst open on the spot; though it lacked the sun’s terrifying flames, it carried a blazing brilliance and the substantive impact of concentrated light!\nBOOM!\nA colossal rumbling sound exploded at the epicenter of the battlefield. The fully realistic tall building, under such an impact, instantly broke apart. The earth shook and mountains trembled!\nApart from this tumultuous chaos, there were only a few crisp BANG! BANG! BANG! sounds! Those were the sounds of the shields activating on the life-sign wristwatches of all the Beast Tamers present. This wasn’t limited to Mo He and the others; it appeared Sun Xiao’s shield had activated as well.",

The Final Result of the Solar Formula?_2\nHowever, besides these, there was also a cry of alarm:\n\"Er Zhuang!\"\nBeyond that, the entire live broadcast screen had gone silent.\nNot a glimmer of light or shadow appeared again.\nClearly, the final burst of light had utterly destroyed even the life-sign monitoring capabilities of the smartwatches. All live broadcast footage had vanished. The screens turned black, displaying no signal.\nWhat exactly had happened?\nAt this moment, no one knew, not even what that last scene truly was.\nThey subconsciously turned their heads to look at a lone figure in the corner not far away. It was that figure who had created such a monster, who had raised such a Pet Beast.\nNow, what exactly had this Pet Beast done under such circumstances? Unquestionably, asking the instigator seemed the most direct approach.\nHowever, facing everyone’s gaze, including Liu Fuhai beside him and Qin Erlong, who had similarly not processed what had just happened, Su Ping closed his eyes, as if he hadn’t seen their looks at all.\nIf it had been any other time, these people would have already demanded answers in frustration. Who could keep them in suspense like this?\nBut not now.\nOver the past two days, every appearance and action of the Wanmu Wolf had been shattering their imaginations, challenging their cognition. Right up until now, they found it impossible to describe this strange Wanmu Wolf with words.\nIs this damn thing a Commander Level Pet Beast?\nWho the hell would believe you?\nWhose Commander Level Pet Beast could single-handedly eliminate enemies several times their number in a chaotic battle? And whose Commander Level Pet Beast could unleash such terrifying power at the last moment?\nSo, what exactly had this Breeder done? Although no one knew, no one dared to hasten him either. They even subconsciously believed that Su Ping’s closed eyes indicated his satisfaction with this Wanmu Wolf, a sign that he had everything under control.\nYet, no one saw Su Ping’s fist trembling inside his sleeve.\nIndeed!\nHe knew it!\nAt this moment, Su Ping was exceptionally certain, absolutely positive, that his previous ideas were indeed correct! The formula he had realized—ever since he began the Cultivation of the Wanmu Wolf and Old Sha started to change, initiating its Evolution—was absolutely correct!\nThat bizarre Sunlight Formula.\nIt had become the most direct reason for the Wanmu Wolf’s current terrifying state. Otherwise, without the Sunlight Energy Transformation formula formed by Heart of Woods, Sunlight Absorption, and Photosynthesis, the Wanmu Wolf might still be extraordinary, but it would essentially be just that.\nIt wasn’t that Su Ping was being harsh—it was simply the truth!\nWithout the bug-like effects of the Sunlight Formula for energy transformation, the Wanmu Wolf wouldn’t have had enough Energy to maintain such control with the Tree Prison, let alone unleash a forest torrent effect akin to the Advent of the Tree Realm. The Tree Prison’s duration probably wouldn’t have exceeded half an hour.\nThus, the Wanmu Wolf’s Racial Potential and inherent strength, while top-notch, definitely couldn’t exceed those of the elite Pet Beast Evolutionary Bodies in this arena by too much. Those who made it into the competition arena were all Evolutionary Bodies from top-tier Cultivation!\nIn the end, it was still the inclusion of its own Heart of Woods Skill that led to such a transformative change.\nFrom the beginning, Su Ping had calculated the special combination of this skill formula. However, the ultimate result was merely the rapid absorption and transformed application of Solar Power. The qualitative change he had calculated had never occurred.\nBut now, Su Ping felt he had seen it!\nIndeed, once the local skill levels of these three energy-transformation Skills achieved consistency, an unimaginable metamorphosis would occur. And just now, Er Zhuang, who seemed to have become light itself, was the best proof.\nOnly Liu Fuhai beside him might have noticed Su Ping’s anomaly at this moment.\nSimilarly, among all present, only Liu Fuhai and a few other Breeders could guess what had happened based on such subtle clues.\nLiu Fuhai was one. Rong Qiu, sitting with the invited Breeders, was also one.\nAt this moment, Rong Qiu, the indifferent woman from Beiyuan Province wearing a black robe, looked at the screen that had turned pitch-dark, and for the first time, her facial control slipped. Her red lips parted in disbelief, staring fixedly at the dark screen, as if trying to glimpse once more that horrifying scene from the blackness, and to suppress the raging tempest and roars within her heart:\nWhat kind of monstrous son has that old scoundrel Su Anyong managed to raise?\nMeanwhile, Ding Yan took a deep breath. He finally swallowed hard. However, it was clear that this newly promoted Senior Breeder didn’t grasp the significance of what had just happened as vividly.\nOnly those Breeders who genuinely understood and had gleaned some insight into what had truly transpired were left utterly stunned.",

The Final Result of the Solar Formula?_3\nBut as Breeders, they could still understand that the combat strength and potential of the Wanmu Wolf were enough to prove Su Ping’s excellence.\nFor a moment, the scene was somewhat frozen. However, just then, someone suddenly exclaimed, \"No, there’s one more person left!\" Indeed, at the very edge of their field of vision, a display screen was still lit. The next moment, without needing any command, this sole remaining screen took over the largest central spot, instantly drawing everyone’s gaze.\nLing Peng cautiously looked toward the not-too-distant location. This last captain of the Snow Wolf Group had managed to survive until the very end.\nIn the chaotic battle that had just transpired, although the Snow Wolf Group primarily focused on harassment, by standing on the same side as the Forest Wolf Troop, they had suffered an unprecedented blow. This assault had decimated the Snow Wolf Group, leaving only Captain Ling, who had fled in the confusion.\nLing Peng reassured himself that he had done his duty to the Forest Wolf Troop. When he got out, he should be able to explain himself to Chief Lin and the Troop Leader.\nSo, under these circumstances, lasting a little longer means a few more survival points. Perhaps a critical ranking could come down to this one or two-point difference?\nBut just then, Ling Peng, who had already retreated to the outermost edge of the battlefield’s center, saw a huge flash of light flicker in the city center. The next instant, even from the city’s outskirts, he heard a deafeningly terrifying sound and felt the ground tremble violently.\nThis vibration and this noise made Ling Peng feel immensely relieved about his retreat.\nIf I had been at the very center, who knows how I would have ended up?\nLuckily, he had run fast.\nBut intense curiosity also compelled Ling Peng to look back towards the city center.\nWhat on earth happened there?\nHe glanced at his life signs watch. The personnel status displayed on it hadn’t changed at all.\nWhat’s going on?\nhe wondered.\nWith such a huge commotion, not a single person was eliminated?\nFinally, Ling Peng gritted his teeth. With his Cold Water Wolf, which had somewhat recovered, he rushed rapidly towards the city center.\nAfter the immense vibration, an eerie silence descended. The entire city was as quiet as a ghost town. Signs of battle were visible everywhere: solidified tree branches, burned-out buildings, and shattered walls and streets. These were the remnants of the previous melee, but now, not a whisper could be heard.\nThe footage followed Ling Peng’s perspective closely, making everyone’s heart race.\nDon’t tell me they were all wiped out just like that?\nthey thought.\nIf that’s the case, it would be utterly outrageous! These are the elites of each team! If these elites were to die or be injured in the competition, it would be a tremendous loss.\nEspecially concerning that last event, the Forest Wolf’s Evolutionary Body. Theoretically, the one who activated the skill should be fine. Moreover, the life signs watch’s shield is supposed to withstand the power of a Monarch Level skill. But you can never rule out the unexpected. After all, Sun Xiao’s final cry before the live broadcast screen went black was deeply concerning.\n\"Damn it, what’s this kid dawdling for? Why isn’t he moving faster?\" one of the commanders grumbled.\n\"Besides this kid, there are no other teams left. What’s he still trying to outlast?\" another added.\n\"Chief Lin, how do you usually instruct your soldiers? How can he still be so timid at a time like this? This won’t do!\"\nEven the Legion’s Chief of Staff beside them turned unhappily to look at Lin Lei. Clearly, Ling Peng’s manner of slowly, almost stealthily, inching forward toward the center was getting on their nerves. The entire Legion was watching this unfold. Damn it, all the top brass throughout the Legion saw Ling Peng’s pathetic, creeping advance, as if he were tailing someone.\nLin Lei felt aggrieved.\nIs this really something to be scolded for?\nhe thought.\nIn the Legion, especially in live combat exercises, isn’t being too careless and losing a tactical opportunity the biggest taboo? Ling Peng is being cautious; no matter how you look at it, that should be considered reasonable, shouldn’t it?\nBut what could Lin Lei say? Under the watchful, unfriendly gazes of the Chief of Staff and several other curious commanders, Lin Lei could only begrudgingly lower his head.\nHowever, he was also irritated internally.\nThe Sand Wolf Troop was too bold and reckless, while Ling Peng of the Snow Wolf Group is indeed too timid. It isn’t just the front-row commanders who are curious; I, Chief Lin, am also uncontrollably curious! Who wouldn’t be? After all, my own soldier is now in the limelight. What exactly is going on? How could I not be curious?\nBut there was nothing he could do at this moment. It had to be said that, aside from the emergence of the Wanmu Wolf which had amazed the entire Legion, and the five elites of the Forest Wolf Troop, the person currently leaving the deepest impression on the commanders was Ling Peng, inching so hesitantly towards the very center.\nIt just remains to be seen what Ling Peng himself will think of all this later.\nFortunately, the small city itself wasn’t very large. After an agonizing wait as Ling Peng traversed several blocks, the man and wolf finally approached the city center, having come from the outskirts.\nHowever, upon witnessing the scene before him, Ling Peng’s jaw dropped. His first instinct was that he had to be seeing things.",

This was because the Beast Tamers and Pet Beasts within those light shields were either unconscious or had apparently been recalled to their Beast Taming Spaces.\nWhat the hell is this?\nLing Peng thought.\nCould Beast Tamers from a neighboring country have attacked? Or had those damn logistics team members deployed some Monarch Level Pet Beast on this battlefield? Otherwise, what the heck is going on with this ground? It looks like it’s been carpet-bombed!\nLing Peng pursed his lips; he actually didn’t quite dare to get closer.\nTo directly bypass the protective capabilities of the life-monitoring watch’s shield and instantly knock out Beast Tamers and their Pet Beasts—just how terrifyingly powerful was that force? What if it wasn’t over yet?\nHowever, it was quite clear that Ling Peng was still hesitating. But someone had finally grown impatient. Previously, hesitation might have been understandable, but now, what was there to think twice about?\nSo, the chief of staff directly entered his authorization at his station. Suddenly, the chief of staff’s voice sounded on Ling Peng’s life-monitoring watch:\n\"Battalion Commander Ling Peng of the Snow Wolf Group, please hurry to confirm the situation of the Forest Wolf Troop and the other comrades. The logistics team and medical team have already been dispatched at top speed. Please, if conditions permit, do your utmost to ensure the safety of all comrades and their Pet Beasts!\"\nThe voice jolted Ling Peng. He snapped to attention, saluted the air, and declared, \"Yes, Sir!\"\nHe finally led his Cold Water Wolf and jogged over, quickly checking each person and Pet Beast.\nThe final result allowed everyone to breathe a sigh of relief: \"Reporting to the Chief, all comrades are merely unconscious. No life-threatening injuries have been found so far. Only this Forest Wolf seems to have completely exhausted its energy and sustained some injuries.\"\nPHEW...\nEven Su Ping could hear the collective long sighs of relief. Obviously, this outcome had put everyone’s minds at ease, Su Ping included.\nBut his gaze, through Ling Peng’s perspective, remained fixed on Erzhuang’s condition. Erzhuang had reverted to its previous appearance. Yet, even just through the live broadcast, Su Ping could sense that Erzhuang was likely in a terrible state—weakened to an unimaginable degree.\nHad Erzhuang truly mastered that strange power just now?\nSu Ping wondered.\nCould it be that such power is unlocked once three Skills simultaneously reach Mastery Level?\nThe problem was, Erzhuang had never displayed such an ability before—not in previous training, nor in any other scenario. Unfortunately, there were too few samples. The only somewhat comparable case was Xiao Qiang, whose three Sun Formula skills had reached Proficient Level.\nBut there were still differences between Erzhuang and the other Wanmu Wolves. The Mastery Level Sun Formula itself, and its mastery of the Blinding Technique—these were abilities the other Wanmu Wolves lacked. These were Erzhuang’s advantages.\nAnd looking at it, Erzhuang’s activation just now was very likely a flash in the pan; he probably hasn’t fully mastered it yet,\nSu Ping mused.\nWith those thoughts, his concern for their immediate safety eased, and Su Ping once again fell into deep contemplation. He knew he had work to do again, even though this task was already part of his plans.\nBut I have to figure it out!\nhe resolved.\nI must even enable my Wanmu Wolves to fully master such a miraculous ability!\nBecause, compared to the Wanmu Wolf’s evolutionary cultivation method, which was directly perfected by the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, this peculiar Sun Formula was the true fruit of Su Ping’s own research.\nLiu Fuhai observed Su Ping, who was lost in thought. He opened his mouth, but ultimately couldn’t resist asking in a somewhat conflicted tone, \"The formula for the Super-Rank Skill... it’s still not perfect, is it?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 192: Chapter 136: First-Class Merit? Honorary Major Su Ping!\n\"Hmm?\" Su Ping turned his head and glanced at Liu Fuhai, whose face was marked with a peculiar expression.\nA Super-Rank Skill? What Super-Rank Skill?\nBlinking, Su Ping quickly came to his senses and looked at Vice President Liu with amazement. \"Is this the cultivation of a Super-Rank Skill?\"\nVice President Liu pursed his lips, the corners of his mouth twitching slightly. He didn’t answer Su Ping’s question. Instead, he looked up to the heavens, speechless and choked with emotion.\nSuper-Rank Skills were the domain and expertise of Breeding Masters. Only those who had truly perfected the cultivation of Super-Rank Skills and made breakthroughs in the path of cultivation could rightfully be called Breeding Masters. But what exactly was the concept of a Super-Rank Skill?\nIt’s too difficult!\nAs the saying goes, not every Emperor-Level Pet Beast even has the opportunity to master a Super-Rank Skill. The effects and power of Super-Rank Skills far exceeded those of ordinary skills, sometimes even defying common sense. Of course, Super-Rank Skills also varied in strength.\nFor so many years, Vice President Liu’s research into Super-Rank Skills had never ceased, not even for a moment! Especially in the past two years, he had focused his entire being on the Super-Rank Skill cultivation for the Icefang Whitewolf. Yet, he still hadn’t achieved the slightest result. The specific combination of Skill Modules, intended to produce an extraordinary synergistic effect, stubbornly refused to undergo a qualitative transformation. This highlighted just how difficult it was to cultivate Super-Rank Skills through nurturing.\nBut what about this situation right now?\nVice President Liu could clearly and distinctly feel that the Wanmu Wolf’s ability was incredibly powerful, almost beyond comprehension. Its final outburst, in particular, made him one hundred percent certain.\nThis was the Skill Module of a Super-Rank Skill!\nYet this blasted kid looked completely clueless, asking him such an exasperating question.\nHowever, Vice President Liu knew Su Ping might not actually be pretending. For countless Breeders, the cultivation of Super-Rank Skills was undoubtedly an enigma. This was because very few people truly knew how Super-Rank Skills were actually cultivated into existence. During his lectures, Vice President Liu had only ever scratched the surface of the subject. Never mind Intermediate Level Breeders; even some Advanced Level Breeders had limited understanding of Super-Rank Skill cultivation.\nWatching the live feed as the logistics and medical teams carried away the fainted Beast Tamers, marking a rather unique conclusion to the match, Vice President Liu paused. Eventually, he couldn’t resist asking, \"If you didn’t know, how did you discover it?\"\nSu Ping genuinely hadn’t been very clear on the matter before. He only knew that, according to theory, skills formed using the ’Solar Formula’ were supposed to undergo a qualitative change. However, he had never imagined that this change would be of *this* nature.\nA Super-Rank Skill? So, does this mean the ultimate composition of the Solar Formula results in a Super-Rank Skill?\nHearing Old Liu’s question, Su Ping didn’t hide anything. The Wanmu Wolf had been born from his own hands; he was the origin, so Su Ping wasn’t worried. He also trusted Old Liu’s character.\nAs it turned out, he had trusted a bit too soon. An internal struggle was evident on Old Liu’s face before he finally sighed helplessly and said in a low voice, \"Apart from me, this matter can, at most, be mentioned to Qin Erlong and Miss Qin. No one else must disclose it recklessly. In a little while, I’ll have a word with Zhao Deguang. I’ll get everyone who witnessed this battle to sign a partial non-disclosure agreement.\"\nSu Ping was taken aback. He eyed the old fellow suspiciously, \"Is it really necessary? Is it that serious?\"\nOld Liu glanced at this clueless brat who completely failed to grasp the gravity of the situation and shook his head helplessly. \"Although it’s highly probable that your discovery was largely due to good luck, I’m worried that some people with ulterior motives might not see it that way. Of course, right now, probably not many people understand what truly happened, but it’s always better to be safe than sorry!\"\nSu Ping genuinely had no idea what this ’just in case’ scenario entailed.\nBut Vice President Liu understood better than anyone. This ’just in case’ referred to an event twenty years prior to Su Ping. A man had risen from obscurity to fame in one fell swoop, his key to success being the cultivation of the Sand-Eating Jiao and its Super-Rank Skill, ’Quicksand Stomach.’ He was the current Master of the Holy Dragon of the Dragon Nation. After his ascension, his sweeping reforms over just a few years had, if not turned the Dragon Nation completely upside down, then at least thoroughly revitalized it.\nVice President Liu was also more aware than anyone of how the ancient, established families, those with lineages stretching back to antiquity, gritted their teeth in hatred at this Master of the Holy Dragon, yet were powerless against him.\nTherefore, the Dragon Nation could not allow another new Master of the Holy Dragon to emerge.\nEven if the possibility was minuscule—perhaps only one in ten, or even one in a hundred—after all, just because their breakthrough creations were similar didn’t mean their subsequent growth and achievements would also be comparable. But again, one had to prepare for the unexpected. He believed those ancient families felt the same way.\nFortunately.\nVice President Liu looked around. He realized that very few people truly understood what had happened; it was too complex for most to grasp. For the vast majority, the Wanmu Wolf’s final burst was merely an incredibly powerful trump card, a burst-type skill.\nNothing more. As a Breeder himself, he just needed to steer the conversation in that direction later. Naturally, no one would then consider other possibilities.",

Honorary Major Su Ping!_2\nSuper-Rank Skills are something countless Beast Tamers dream of but can never attain.\n\"Remember, don’t tell anyone about this. If you’re going to announce it, do it at the Breeder Convention. Got it?\"\nSeeing Old Liu’s stern expression, Su Ping belatedly realized that what he had created seemed a bit more incredible than he had anticipated.\nSu Ping nodded.\nLiu Fuhai did not say anything more. Vice President Liu, who seemed to have been just making casual remarks, returned to his jovially encouraging demeanor, watching the final tally of scores on the screen.\nThe Military Strategist’s voice rang out after the last few stunned Beast Tamers were carried out, \"The Legion Tournament has ended! The tournament is successfully completed, and rankings will be based on points!\"\nUnder the holy light emanating from the medical Pet Beasts—especially from the ’Holy Bamboo’ which had reached Monarch Level—all the Legion Beast Tamers who had fainted eventually regained consciousness, including Sun Xiao.\nHe looked around blankly, then seemed to recall something. Only after seeing that Er Zhuang, too, had recovered, did he breathe a sigh of relief.\nHowever, Sun Xiao soon noticed a problem with Er Zhuang’s Level.\nEr Zhuang was previously Commander Sixth Order, but after waking up this time, its Level had dropped to Commander Fifth Stage? A regression in Realm?\nSun Xiao thought back to the last scene again.\nWhat exactly was that?\nHe didn’t know. He feared this question could only be answered by asking Su Ping, the Breeder, later.\nHowever, the Legion’s final announcement would not cease just for his thoughts.\nThe Military Strategist’s voice rose again from above, \"Next, we will proceed with the ranking and award ceremony. Teams and their commanders whose names are called, please come up to the stage to receive their awards!\"\n\"First place, Forest Wolf Troop! Awarded a Group Second-Class Merit, and an Individual Second-Class Merit for each member! Each person is awarded 8,000 Battle Merit Points!\"\nThere was no doubt; the first place in the tournament went undisputed. The performance of the Forest Wolf Troop and that mysterious Evolutionary Body had thoroughly conquered everyone. They had completely overpowered everyone else. If anyone other than the Forest Wolf Troop had taken first place, it would have been unbelievable.\nAnd the reward had everyone green with envy.\nNot only a group merit, but each member also receives an individual Second-Class Merit?\nThis was a bargaining chip for promotion. Perhaps soon, these individuals’ official ranks could climb yet another level. Besides, 8,000 Battle Merit Points was an unimaginably large amount.\n\"Second place, Black Tiger Group! Awarded a Group Third-Class Merit, and an Individual Third-Class Merit for each member! Each person is awarded 5,000 Battle Merit Points!\"\nUndoubtedly, the reward for second place was significantly lower.\n\"Third place, Shadow Leopard Group! Awarded a Group Third-Class Merit, and an Individual Third-Class Merit for each member! Each person is awarded 3,000 Battle Merit Points!\"\nIn contrast, the difference in reward between third and second place wasn’t that large.\n\"Fourth place, Snow Wolf Group! Awarded an Individual Third-Class Merit for each member! Each person is awarded 1,500 Battle Merit Points!\"\nThe fourth-place winner, however, was a surprise to everyone. The Snow Wolf Group!\nThe Snow Wolf Group was the team that survived until the end. So, by adding points for their number of survivors (calculated as survivors multiplied by 10) to their base score, and then gaining another 10 points, they managed to surpass the Bull Python Group and Tree Ape Group, which had only a small point gap with them. Thus, they secured fourth place.\n\"Fifth place, Tree Ape Group...\"\nEventually, the five teams and their respective commanders took the stage.\nIt was evident from Zhang Lie’s face, which was beaming with a smile more radiant than yesterday’s sunshine. Unfortunately, no one was inclined to acknowledge him.\nAfter they stepped down, everyone shifted their attention to the next figures about to appear on stage. The Legion had long made promises. For this outsourced Cultivation, the Breeders who placed in the rankings would also receive a reward from the military. And now was undoubtedly the time to present the awards.\nThey had little interest in the other Breeders, but among them was one whose name had become thunderously well-known over the past two days: Su Ping! At the mere age of eighteen or nineteen, he had bred a completely new Evolutionary Body for the Forest Wolf. And this new Evolutionary Body had performed spectacularly in this Legion Tournament. Anyone could tell that in the future, Su Ping’s name would likely spread, especially in Jianghai Province and even among certain circles in the eastern provinces.\nUnfortunately, Su Ping hadn’t been sitting with the other Breeders; he was seated elsewhere. This made it difficult for those Breeders who had intended to approach him—whether to get acquainted, build connections, or even poach him with ill intentions—to make their move. Of course, perhaps Vice President Liu had sensed the malicious intent of these individuals and had made preparations in advance.\nSure enough, they didn’t have to wait long, as the Military Strategist’s voice quickly rose again: \"Next, I invite Breeder Su Ping from the Forest Wolf Troop, Breeder Mo Tu from the Black Tiger Group, Breeder Bai Ying from the Shadow Leopard Group, Breeder Ms. Rong Qiu from the Snow Wolf Group, and Breeder Li Senlin from the Tree Ape Group to come to the stage.\"\nSu Ping stood up from his seat. Under the strange gazes of everyone present, and unlike the other Breeders, he quickly reached the Military Strategist’s side in just three steps.",

Therefore, the Legion awards a Third-Class Merit Medal and an exchange quota of 10,000 Legion Battle Merit Points! Furthermore, you may cooperate with the Legion in the future and will have priority in recommending suitable members to join the Legion!\"\nZhao Deguang handed the Third-Class Merit Medal to Rong Qiu, saying with a smile, \"Congratulations, Miss Rong Qiu.\"\nRong Qiu’s expression remained remarkably calm; she merely nodded.\nSu Ping, looking on from the side, was somewhat surprised.\nThis Breeder from Beiyuan Province knew people from the Legion?\nBut Su Ping couldn’t be bothered to dwell on it.\n\"Shadow Leopard Group Breeder Bai Ying, the Legion awards a Third-Class Merit Medal and an exchange quota of 8,000 Legion Battle Merit Points! Additionally, after deliberation by the Legion, you are awarded the honorary rank of Lieutenant in the Legion! You will enjoy all the benefits of an officer of that rank and may join the Legion at any time. Upon joining, your honorary rank can be promoted by one level!\"\nInstantly, as Zhao Deguang spoke, countless gazes filled with envy and admiration turned towards the man in his thirties named Bai Ying.\nUltimately, in this Legion competition, what mattered most to them as Breeders was this honorary military rank!\nThis was the primary reason all the Breeders had come.\nUnfortunately, it seemed only Breeders who made it into the top three were eligible.\nTo enjoy all the Legion’s benefits without needing to train or undertake missions—who could refuse such a fantastic deal of reaping rewards without the work?\nNot to mention, if they wished, they could join the Legion at any time, and their military rank could continue to rise.\nOf course, most people probably wouldn’t choose to join directly; reaping benefits without the associated duties was the dream.\nFor a Senior Breeder like Bai Ying, joining the Legion merely as a Captain wouldn’t be appealing anyway.\nWithout giving the others too much time for envy or resentment, Zhao Deguang then approached Mo Tu.\n\"Black Tiger Group Breeder Mo Tu, the Legion awards a Second-Class Merit Medal and an exchange quota of 8,000 Legion Battle Merit Points! Additionally, after deliberation by the Legion, you are awarded the honorary rank of Captain in the Legion! You will enjoy all the benefits of an officer of that rank and may join the Legion at any time. Upon joining, your honorary rank can be promoted by one level!\"\n\"Thank you, General Zhao!\"\nMo Tu was a man in his sixties, but he showed no signs of old age, clearly possessing considerable Beast Tamer strength. Moreover, he seemed to be acquainted with this General Zhao, lacking the usual reserve of ordinary people.\nFinally, Zhao Deguang’s steps slowly brought him before Su Ping.\nEven Su Ping instinctively held his breath.\nIt was finally his turn.\nEveryone’s gaze followed, settling on Su Ping.\nThey also wanted to know what kind of reward Su Ping, such a young Breeder and the champion of this first Legion Grand Tournament, would receive from the Legion.\nA First-Class Merit seemed unlikely; the criteria were incredibly demanding.\nIt would be very difficult to earn for just one competition; otherwise, the Forest Wolf Troop wouldn’t have previously received only one collective Second-Class Merit and one individual Second-Class Merit.\nHowever, amidst the many expectant gazes, Zhao Deguang smiled and said, \"Forest Wolf Troop Breeder Su Ping, the Legion awards a First-Class Merit Medal and an exchange quota of 10,000 Legion Battle Merit Points! Additionally, after deliberation by the Legion, you are awarded the honorary rank of Major in the Legion! You will enjoy all the benefits of an officer of that rank and may join the Legion at any time. Upon joining, your honorary rank can be promoted by one level!\"\nAs he spoke, Zhao Deguang took out a military medal and a pin representing the honorary rank of Major.\nLooking at Su Ping with a smiling gaze, he said, \"Breeder Su, stand tall. This is a man’s most glorious moment!\"\nHowever, at this moment, Su Ping was stunned. Looking uncertainly at the smiling Zhao Deguang, he asked, \"A First-Class Merit?\"\nZhao Deguang nodded with a smile. \"Yes, third place gets a Third-Class Merit, second place a Second-Class Merit, and first place a First-Class Merit. Isn’t that to be expected?\"\nExpected? Expected, my foot!\nThe honorary rank of Major alone made Su Ping feel somewhat undeserving.\nAnd now a First-Class Merit on top of that?\nMeeting Zhao Deguang’s smiling gaze, Su Ping desperately wanted to ask the General, ’Am I truly worthy of this?’\nEven those below were stunned, including Liu Fuhai.",

Is Old Zhao also trying to poach someone?\"\nQin Erlong silently rolled his eyes at his old mate.\nDamn it, this old coot has developed a persecution complex. Does everyone look like a poacher to him?\nHowever, Qin Erlong also looked at Zhao Deguang with some suspicion. \"Indeed, something’s not right. By the way, you’ve been to Old Zhao’s place before. Does he have a daughter, granddaughter, or great-niece or something?\"\nLiu Fuhai, in turn, gave this old fellow an eye-roll.\nYou’re not much better yourself, old coot.\nBut there was definitely something fishy about this matter!\nThe two old foxes exchanged a glance, sensing there was more to it.\nAs a matter of fact, the two old men weren’t wrong.\nWhile everyone was still astonished, shocked, and slow to react, Zhao Deguang pinned the first-class military medal on Su Ping and officially conferred upon him the rank of Honorary Major. Then, straightening Su Ping’s collar, he whispered, \"Stop by my office before you leave later. I have something to discuss with you.\"\nDiscuss what?\nSu Ping wondered. Liu Fuhai and Qin Erlong were even more curious.\nSo, the three of them went to the office together.\nZhao Deguang was rendered speechless seeing the two glare at him like predators, protectively shielding Su Ping behind him as if Su Ping were a little chick. \"What’s this about, you two?\"\n\"Old Zhao, you don’t have any unmarried granddaughters or great-nieces, do you?\"\n\"Old Zhao, it isn’t easy for Jianghai to produce a Breeder. You can’t add insult to injury!\"\n\"...\" Old Zhao’s brow furrowed slightly. Looking at these two old coots, he thought,\nWhat on earth is all this nonsense?\n\"I have genuine business with Su Ping, unlike your petty speculations. Scram, scram, scram! I need to talk to Su Ping alone.\"\nAfter getting Old Zhao’s assurance, although Liu Fuhai and Qin Erlong were still not quite at ease, they eventually left the office.\nWhose fault was it but their own for being on his turf?\nWith the door closed, Zhao Deguang then turned to look at the somewhat constrained Su Ping.\nHe couldn’t help but feel constrained! This was a General, after all!\nThe Beast Tamer Corps under his command was one of the primary forces in the East, making him a true big shot. Moreover, this big shot was from the Legion. Su Ping’s own father had mentioned serving in the armed forces, so Su Ping held him in considerable awe.\nHowever, Su Ping was also curious.\nWhat kind of official business could this Legion Commander, with whom he’d never had any prior contact, possibly have with a mere Breeder like himself? Even if it was official business, they shouldn’t need to seek him out personally, right?\n\"Su Ping, relax.\" Noticing Su Ping’s slight nervousness, Zhao Deguang consciously softened his stern expression and said with a smile, \"I know you’re a bit puzzled. According to regulations, even for Legion competitions, a first-class merit award wouldn’t typically be issued unless under special circumstances. It certainly wouldn’t be given to an outsider who isn’t even an official member of the Legion!\"\nHe paused, then continued, \"Therefore, I also have a favor to ask of you.\"\nSu Ping raised an eyebrow, but before he could speak, Zhao Deguang continued with a smile, \"Of course, don’t misunderstand. Whether you agree to my request or not, this first-class merit award is yours. No one can take it away, and no one will question it.\n\"However, I genuinely believe this matter could also benefit you. If you are selected, it would be a great help to your development.\"\nHearing Zhao Deguang put it that way, Su Ping’s interest was piqued. \"What exactly is it?\"\nZhao Deguang smiled slightly. \"Recently, the higher-ups intend to establish a new Special Beast Taming Forces. For this, they need to select a group of Breeders to dedicate themselves to researching the cultivation and evolution methods of specific Pet Beasts. This is to meet the Pet Beast requirements for the Special Beast Taming Forces. Each provincial Legion Commander has one nomination slot...\"",

After Lin Lei secretly gave him a third-class merit medal, Su Ping set off with the two old fellows to return to Linzhou City.\nThe original promise was that if he made it into the top five, Lin Lei would find a way to secure a second-class merit for him, in addition to the third-class one from their corps.\nBut now, the goal had been far exceeded; Old Zhao had been generous and given him a first-class merit. Lin Lei’s third-class merit was just the icing on the cake.\nHowever, throughout the journey, Su Ping wasn’t in the right mindset, his thoughts occupied by what General Zhao had told him.\nSpecial Beast Taming Forces?\nWas there really such a thing within the Legion?\nA brand-new Special Beast Taming Force?\nEven now, with so many Breeders and Evolutionary Bodies in the Dragon Nation, had none met the requirements for that Special Beast Taming Force?\nWhat kind of Pet Beasts did this so-called brand-new Special Beast Taming Force need?\nOn this point, General Zhao did share some information.\nWhen the time came for selection, an instructor from the Special Beast Taming Forces and several Breeding Masters would conduct personal interviews.\nIt was only during the actual interview and selection process that the desired cultivation direction and the requirements for Evolutionary Body Pet Beasts would be revealed.\nHowever, Old Zhao wasn’t entirely without news. After a moment’s thought, he continued,\n\"It should be in the Undead Type cultivation direction. When the request was made, they prioritized Breeders proficient in Undead Type cultivation, but it wasn’t a mandatory requirement! So you can try your luck when the time comes; there’s nothing to lose if you’re not selected.\"\nUndead Type.\nHis first thought was, naturally, of his precious little Paperman, Qian Yi.\nBut, claiming Paperman as part of the Necromancy System seemed a bit far-fetched, given its appearance.\nAnd besides, these were the Special Beastmaster Troops!\nThough Su Ping had never been in contact with them, he could glean some clues from special forces units in his previous life.\nInhuman training processes, formidable individual combat capabilities, unwavering willpower.\nThey represented the elite, the very pinnacle of the Legion.\nIn today’s Beast Taming society, this was even more true.\nThey were even more powerful and mysterious.\nBecause in today’s Dragon Nation, even the Legions under Zhao Deguang’s command did not have direct authority over any Special Beast Taming Force.\nEach Special Beast Taming Force was incredibly secretive, taking orders directly from higher echelons and operating independently of the local Legions.\nOne could only imagine how secretive these Special Beast Taming Forces were.\nNot to mention, for this matter, even the selection of Breeders would be personally overseen by Breeding Masters and that mysterious instructor from the Special Beastmaster Troops.\nSuch prestige, such profound foundations—could a Pet Beast like Paperman even qualify for such a place?\nAlthough Su Ping now had a direction, and he believed that with his research and development, Paperman’s future was definitely not so simple...\nHowever, Old Zhao had also said that the Breeder selection for these so-called Special Beastmaster Troops would officially begin next spring.\nAnd before New Year’s Eve, all Breeders who wished to pre-qualify for the selection had to register.\nCould he present Paperman’s potential direction and satisfy the instructor from the Special Beastmaster Troops, or even the Breeding Masters, before the New Year?\nSu Ping didn’t know. Even he lacked that much confidence.\nYet, it was so incredibly tempting!\nZhao Deguang looked honest and unassuming, but damn, he wasn’t a good person at all!\nHe was blatantly tempting him.\nThings like, \"Once you’re in the Special Beastmaster Troops, all resources, even Emperor Level ones, you can take and use as you please.\"\nAnd, \"As long as you have the chance to complete missions, your rank as an honorary major could be further promoted, and the monthly welfare Battle Merit Points and such would be more than you could ever spend.\"\nAnd, \"The Breeders in the Special Beastmaster Troops will be provided with special resources to accelerate meditation, all for your use.\"\nAnd even, \"There are also special resources like the Stone of Creation, a supreme treasure that can alter and enhance a Beast Tamer’s Space Characteristics each time they break through a Great Realm.\"\nThe old fellow even said, \"The Legion’s high command possesses a type of treasured resource that can help improve a Beast Tamer’s Talent effect, enhancing their Talent effects.\"\nSu Ping had never even heard of these things during his school days.\nBlah, blah, blah, a whole long list.\nBut in reality...\nWhen Old Zhao mentioned the third point—the abundance of resources that could accelerate his personal meditation and rapidly advance his Meditation Realm—Su Ping had already succumbed.\nJust as Old Zhao had said, there was no harm in trying.\n\"Su Ping, what kind of bewitching potion did Zhao Deguang give you? Are you still not back to your senses?\"\nFinally, as they approached the outskirts of Linzhou City, Liu Fuhai couldn’t help but speak up.\nSu Ping snapped back to reality, pulling himself from his thoughts, and belatedly scratched his head.\n\"Sorry...\"\n\"Su Ping, what exactly did Old Zhao tell you?\"\nQin Erlong was also curious.\nSu Ping, however, felt somewhat helpless.",

      "content": "Chapter 197: Chapter 137: Special Beast Taming Forces Training? Return to the Heart of Woods!_2\nGeneral Zhao had told him that the matter of the Special Beast Taming Forces was not to be spoken of to outsiders.\nAlthough the two before him were not strangers, Old Zhao hadn’t specified if *they* could be told.\nThe Special Beast Taming Forces were an absolute secret.\nEvery detail about these forces—from members to Breeders, instructors, and Pet Beasts, even down to the type of Pet Beast and the names of the forces—was not permitted to be divulged in the slightest.\nSeeing Su Ping’s troubled expression, Qin Erlong was also taken aback.\nIt was Liu Fuhai who asked, \"You can’t say it? Is it like that matter you told me about before?\"\nSu Ping nodded.\n\"Alright then,\" Liu Fuhai also nodded. \"We won’t ask. Legion matters are, after all, fraught with taboos, and it’s better not to hear about them.\"\nThis time, it was Qin Erlong’s turn to be suspicious. He turned to Liu Fuhai. \"What did you and Su Ping talk about?\"\nLiu Fuhai shot him a glance. \"Didn’t I tell you? I can’t say!\"\n\"Can’t you act like a human being?\"\nThis time, Qin Erlong experienced the same maddening frustration Liu Fuhai must have felt when he himself was being cryptic earlier.\nThis agonizing curiosity made him shift his resentful gaze from Liu Fuhai to Su Ping.\n\"Uh, Old Liu,\" Su Ping touched his nose somewhat helplessly. \"Didn’t you say before that you could talk it over with Old Qin? There’s no one else here now...\"\nLiu Fuhai hummed twice, and Qin Erlong immediately understood.\n\"A few days ago, Magic Capital sent me a package with a jin of Dragon Blood Tea...\" Qin Erlong began.\nLiu Fuhai’s eyes lit up, and he looked at Qin Erlong eagerly. \"What Dragon Blood?\"\nQin Erlong shot the old coot—who wouldn’t lift a finger unless there was something in it for him—a speechless glance. \"What other Dragon Blood could it be? The best-tasting kind—Ice Dragon Blood...\"\n\"Eight liang!\"\n\"Nonsense! Three liang at most!\"\n\"Deal.\"\nOld Liu was utterly satisfied, feeling as though a heavy burden that had been weighing on his chest for some time had finally been lifted.\nHe felt thoroughly refreshed from head to toe.\n\"Alright now, spill it. What exactly happened? I saw you being all secretive at Old Zhao’s place earlier.\"\nLiu Fuhai paused for a moment, then spoke in a low voice, \"At the end of the previous competition, that immense radiance emitted by the Wanmu Wolf, and its state of being enveloped in light—that was the initial combination of a nascent Super-Rank Skill’s Skill Module!\"\nWanmu Wolf, immense light, Super-Rank Skill, nascent...\nThe moment these four keywords connected in his mind, even with Qin Erlong’s considerable composure, he couldn’t help but blurt out, \"What the fuck?!\"\nPerhaps because he wasn’t a specialized Breeder, Qin Erlong didn’t know much about certain aspects of Cultivation.\nBut as a powerful Beast Tamer, Qin Erlong was crystal clear about matters related to Pet Beast combat.\nSo naturally, he understood what Super-Rank Skills represented.\nQin Erlong looked at Su Ping, his eyes wide with a newfound worry.\nIndeed, he was worried.\nBecause before this, he had thought that—concerns about his own old age aside—with his wife, their unfilial son, and Xiao Xue’s own Talented Ability, Xiao Xue was certainly a good enough match for this rascal Su Ping, even if Su Ping only possessed a modicum of talent in Cultivation. In fact, from the standpoint of social standing, they weren’t perfectly matched.\nBut if his granddaughter fancied him, that wasn’t a major issue.\nBut now, it seemed things weren’t quite so simple, were they?\nHow did this rascal keep shattering his perceptions time and again?\nIs this reasonable?\nPreviously, his granddaughter Xiao Xue had used the example of the Master of the Holy Dragon to refute Sun Chaoju. And now? Had it turned into a self-fulfilling prophecy?\nAlthough this kid will likely face enormous difficulties compared to that Master of the Holy Dragon in the future, starting off exactly the same way is still too much to handle!\nAt this moment, Qin Erlong understood why Old Liu had kept this matter under wraps.\n\"Indeed, this matter must be kept secret for now,\" Qin Erlong nodded after exhaling slowly. \"At least until the Breeder Competition.\"\nBy then, Su Ping might enter the sights of certain influential people, and those who might want to resort to underhanded tactics wouldn’t dare.\nOld Liu shot him a disdainful look. \"What nonsense are you spouting? Breeder Competition? It’s still in its nascent stages. We haven’t even confirmed the number of Skill Modules, and that burst from the Wanmu Wolf was just a flash in the pan. I even went to check afterward; there was hardly a trace.\"\n\"To prove achievements at the Breeder Competition, he must fully display a Super-Rank Skill. Do you think that’s like you drinking tea? One slurp and it’s done? It’s incredibly difficult! Ultimately, there’s only so much time before this Breeder Competition; whether he can complete it is still unknown. Next year’s Breeder Competition, perhaps...\"\n\"Just because you can’t do it doesn’t mean Su Ping can’t, understand?\" Qin Erlong, clearly feeling bold again, snorted coldly. \"Do you think I was asking you? I’m talking to Su Ping! Who the hell was it that swore up and down to me that it was impossible to cultivate the Wanmu Wolf in a short time? And now you’re here barking at me, flaunting your seniority as a Breeder?\"\nIndeed, this tirade made Liu Fuhai’s face flush red, and he was left speechless.\nHaving regained the upper hand, Qin Erlong took out his phone and started scrolling through it.\n\"What are you doing?\" Old Liu said. \"Let me tell you, this matter cannot be leaked carelessly. No, seriously, can’t you, an old coot like you, have some dignity? Why do you have to report every little thing to your wife? At your age...\"\nQin Erlong sneered and ignored him.\nWhat does this old fool know?\nHaving my wife in on it will provide an extra layer of security for Su Ping, won’t it?\nListening to the two bickering beside him, which was giving him a headache, Su Ping felt rather helpless and quickly changed the subject, \"By the way, Old Liu, where is Breeder Yang?\"\nHowever, Su Ping hadn’t expected this question to completely stump Liu Fuhai.\nOnly then did Old Liu recall that back at the Legion base, he seemed to have forgotten a student, hadn’t he?\n「Legion Base.」\nYang He watched the figures coming and going outside the spatial vortex; they were all Breeders departing.\nHe pursed his lips for a moment, looking around for any sign of his teacher.\nBut he couldn’t find a hide nor hair of him.\nEventually, among all the Breeders coming and going outside the spatial vortex, only a solitary Yang He remained, looking around in bewilderment.\nOne of the returning Legion members recognized him.\n\"Huh? Breeder Yang? Why are you still here? Your teacher? You mean President Liu? He left with President Qin and Breeder Su a long time ago. I thought you’d left with them...\"\nFeeling the Jianghai weather, which was on the verge of winter—though not excessively cold by the coast—Yang He felt as if snowflakes were landing on his head, and a solitary winter plum was blooming beside him.\n...\n「Less than half an hour later」\nSu Ping finally returned to Linzhou after being away for over two days.\nUnfortunately, before he could even step into his house, Old Liu dragged him off to the Breeder Association to discuss the Wanmu Wolf’s Cultivation and the progress of the Solar Formula.\nOld Liu knew his limits and didn’t probe too deeply.\nNoticing Su Ping’s exhaustion, he simply waved his hand, telling him to go back and rest first.\nThen, just as Su Ping had stepped out of the gate, he was stopped by Sun Chaoju and others.\nAt this moment, Su Ping profoundly felt how fickle circumstances could be.\nJust a few months ago, Sun Chaoju couldn’t stand the sight of him, no matter how he looked at him. Now, he was practically ready to kneel and call him ’Dad’.\nHe was incredibly warm, and then, calling over his friends, insisted on throwing Su Ping a welcome-home banquet.\nHe’d only been gone a few hundred kilometers for a little over two days. What was there to give a welcome-home banquet for, or to ’dust him off’ from?\nSu Ping managed to decline only after considerable effort. By the time he was escorted back to Heart of Woods, the sun was setting, and the sky had already darkened.\nLooking at his own front door, Su Ping felt an unprecedented warmth, like a young swallow returning to its nest, as he opened the door to Heart of Woods. Unfortunately, just as he had comfortably flopped onto his sofa and let out a groan of contentment, Old Guan appeared before him.\n\"Xiao Ping, you really are back!\"\nWhat’s with the ’really’?\nSu Ping suddenly had an uneasy premonition.\n\"A woman, who says she also came from the Legion, is here to see you about something!\" Guan Qianshan informed him.\nFilled with doubt, Su Ping went to the reception room in Heart of Woods and immediately saw the woman, still dressed in black.\nWho else could it be but Rong Qiu, the Breeder from the Snow Wolf Group?\nHowever, Su Ping had barely sat down, before he could even ask the purpose of her visit, when her first words left him utterly stunned.\n\"Xiao Ping, you don’t mind if I call you that, do you? After all, your dad wanted you to recognize me as your godmother...\"",

      "content": "Chapter 198: Chapter 138: Xiao Qing’s Cultivation? The Benefits of Military Ranks!\nTwo days ago, Rong Qiu had just wanted to give Su Anyong an eye roll for his words.\nNever mind social status; based on age alone, is she suitable to be this brat’s godmother?\nA stepmother, maybe. But the old guy was, at best, all talk.\nHowever, now Rong Qiu suddenly felt that maybe age wasn’t so important after all?\nSo, after finishing her business, she didn’t rush back to Beiyuan Province but hurried to the Heart of Woods instead.\nAs for Su Ping, he blinked, looking at the smiling woman in black before him. For a moment, he couldn’t react.\nDammit, could it be that his old man wasn’t just shooting the breeze with him?\nThe stepmother that the old coot mentioned, was she real?\nSu Ping had never believed a word Su Anyong said. But now, with this woman who seemed to pop out of nowhere appearing so suddenly, Su Ping was actually quite stunned.\n\"Excuse me, do you know my father?\"\nRong Qiu nodded with a smile.\n\"Of course, I know him, and our relationship is beyond your imagination, you know~\"\nThis woman, completely different from how she appeared in the Legion, winked at Su Ping, giving him an ’you know what I mean’ look.\nSu Ping remained silent.\nIndeed, one is influenced by the company one keeps.\nCould a woman who knew his old man be up to any good?\nIt had to be said, if possible, Su Ping naturally preferred to spend more time with attractive women. But hanging out with a woman whose intentions were unclear and who had an ambiguous relationship with his dad made Su Ping even miss Dong Muyun.\nSo, he cut to the chase.\n\"Then, do you need something from me?\"\nRong Qiu clicked her tongue. Apparently sensing Su Ping’s wariness, she nodded in satisfaction.\n\"No wonder Su Anyong left with such peace of mind. I’m here regarding a matter your dad entrusted to me...\"\nShe paused before continuing.\n\"How is that mutated Poison Type Wolf Pet of yours doing now?\"\nThis woman even knew about this?\nIt seemed she wasn’t lying.\nSu Ping let down his guard a little. Xiao Qing had been in the Beast Taming Space these past two days. Su Ping had given the little guy things to do. During the days he was at the Legion, he had Xiao Qing help him plant sunflower seeds in the Beast Taming Space.\nRong Qiu let out a soft laugh. \"Alright, it’s good to be cautious, but don’t be so guarded all the time. It can easily hinder emotional connection.\"\nSu Ping really didn’t know what sort of emotional connection he was supposed to have with this woman who wanted to be his godmother out of the blue. He replied helplessly.\n\"It’s okay, Elite Second Rank, and it’s probably not far from breaking through to Elite Third Rank.\"\nRong Qiu nodded.\n\"When that little guy was sent away from my Rong Family, I was quite concerned. It was a stroke of luck for it to find a good home with you. Honestly, talking to you, brat, is less interesting than talking to Su Anyong. Since that’s the case, I’ll just get to the point. Your dad has entrusted my Rong Family with a task: to find and complete the evolutionary Cultivation of your mutated Poison Type Little Forest Wolf. The Rong Family specializes in the Cultivation and Evolution of various Poison Type Pet Beasts.\"\nUpon hearing this, Su Ping raised an eyebrow.\nSo Xiao Qing’s origin was related to this woman?\nAnd it was sent over from that... Rong Family?\nAnd now, that old coot wanted this Rong Family to conveniently handle Xiao Qing’s evolutionary research and Cultivation?\nThis was the so-called stepmother and the so-called gift that the old man had talked about.\nSu Ping wasn’t excited. Instead, he frowned slightly and asked,\n\"What conditions did Su Anyong agree to with your family?\"\nRong Qiu shrugged, smiling as she said,\n\"That’s not something you should be worrying about, kiddo!\"\nSu Ping’s frown deepened.\n\"If I don’t need the Rong Family’s help and decide to research Xiao Qing’s evolutionary Cultivation on my own, does Su Anyong still need to fulfill the conditions?\"\nIf this were before, Rong Qiu would have dismissed such talk out of hand. Pet Beast Cultivation, especially evolutionary Cultivation, isn’t simple. If it were that easy, everyone would be a Breeder, especially a Poison Type Breeder. There are quite a few basic Poison Type Pet Beasts, but their Evolutionary Bodies might be the rarest among all Attribute Pet Beasts. After all, Poison Type Cultivation can often directly threaten the Life of the Pet Beast itself.\nBut for the Su Ping in front of her, Rong Qiu didn’t harbor a shred of doubt. The scene that had unfolded within the Bai Tian Legion would remain an unforgettable shock for Rong Qiu for the rest of her life. The young Beast Tamer before her was indeed qualified to make such a statement.\nHowever, Rong Qiu shook her head helplessly.\n\"Xiao Ping, many things aren’t as simple as you think. But rest assured, your father’s Life won’t be in danger.\"\nTruth be told, Rong Qiu’s words did slightly relieve the tension in Su Ping’s heart. Although he wasn’t sure exactly what this woman did, as a direct party involved, she had no reason to lie to him about such a matter.\nRong Qiu blinked.\n\"So, Master Su, do you still want to study the evolutionary Cultivation of that mutated Poison Type Forest Wolf by yourself?\"\nSu Ping pursed his lips.\n\"How exactly can you and your so-called Rong Family help me?\"\nIf help is offered, insisting on doing everything alone is just foolish, isn’t it?\nSince Su Anyong had already paved the way, Su Ping wasn’t the type to be difficult and reject his parents’ help. He certainly wasn’t the kind of fool who would do that, only to then shamelessly use their connections or money while pretending to be struggling independently.",

No matter what, the Level of that mutated Forest Wolf needs to reach at least the Elite Eighth Stage. Additionally, during this time, I’ll give you some of my Cold Water Wolf’s Cultivation experiences. It is also a Poison Type Snow Wolf that has been converted. You can have a look when the time comes. Once your Forest Wolf’s tier has advanced, if you have time, come visit Beihai City. Then, based on your ideas and requirements, we can determine the Forest Wolf’s Evolution direction.\"\nCold Water Wolf!\nIt had to be said that within this Legion, Su Ping’s impression of Rong Qiu’s Cold Water Wolf was indeed quite profound. The poisonous fog was also a wide-range, lethal, crowd-control Pet Beast. It was able to fight until the very end and even stealthily secured a spot in the top five. Although it related to tactics and strategy, there was no doubt about the strength of the Cold Water Wolf itself—it was absolutely adequate.\nHowever, to directly share the experience of cultivating Evolutionary Bodies?\nSu Ping glanced at Rong Qiu.\nSo generous?\nThe experience of any Breeder, even if it wasn’t a complete Cultivation method, was a Breeder’s entire life’s work. One could learn a lot from it.\nCould she really be that magnanimous?\nObviously, Rong Qiu could not decipher the meaning behind Su Ping’s gaze.\nShe didn’t linger. After taking out a small booklet from her Beast Taming Space and handing it over to Su Ping, she left the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base amidst Su Ping’s waving goodbye.\nRong Qiu didn’t even delay, heading straight to the suburban airport. While waiting, she took out her mobile phone and, after some consideration, dialed a number.\n\"Hello, Qiuqiu, what’s the matter this time?\"\n\"I’ve mentioned the Cultivation matter to Su Ping.\"\n\"...\"\nSu Anyong, on the other end of the phone, fell into silence, clearly no longer in the mood for jests.\n\"When will you stop being so willful?\" Su Anyong finally spoke with some resignation.\n\"It’s not too bad. Your son is alright. The first thing he asked about was your condition.\"\n\"You...\"\n\"Don’t worry, I know the rules.\" Rong Qiu snorted with disdain, \"Initially, because of the close relationship between you, me, and my family, they pulled you out of that forsaken place. And now, they’ve made you an instructor for the new military unit. In the end, it’s because the Rong Family pledged loyalty. Those people felt reassured and, realizing that what they did in the past was unseemly, now want to make amends.\"\n\"Alright, some things are best left unsaid. Now that you’re this age, you’ve become increasingly loose-lipped, haven’t you?\" Su Anyong sounded a bit impatient.\nRong Qiu didn’t mind, \"By the way, what’s this new unit going to be called? What will be its main focus?\"\nSu Anyong felt somewhat helpless. Among the few people in his life he felt most at a loss with, not even Su Ping was more daunting than Rong Qiu.\n\"Nothing’s been decided yet. For now, it will mainly focus on the Necromancy Series, aiming for diverse functionality and adapting to various extreme environments. Also, this is the last time I’m telling you about this. Don’t bring it up again.\"\n\"TSK, I’m not even interested.\"\n\"By the way, the Legion tournament is over, right? How did it go?\" Su Anyong ultimately couldn’t resist asking.\nHow did it go?\nRong Qiu thought again about what she had witnessed that morning, the event that had occurred, and let out a sigh. \"First place, Honorary Major, a first-class merit.\"\n\"WHAT!?!\" Su Anyong’s voice suddenly boomed.\nBut Rong Qiu had anticipated this and had already moved the phone away from her ear.\n\"Has the Eastern Corps gone mad? Honorary Major? A first-class merit? Does that General Zhao want my son as his son-in-law or grandson-in-law or what?\"\n\"Who knows? But Su Ping is indeed worthy of that first-class merit.\"\n\"Oh? Why?\"\n\"HEH, not telling you. Anyway, I’m boarding soon, so I won’t talk to you anymore.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Oh right, one last question. Does the offer for me to be Su Ping’s godmother still stand?\"\n\"Ah?\"\n\"Hanging up...\"\n...\nRong Qiu’s arrival and departure left Su Ping with no time to properly examine his gains this time. While interacting with Rong Qiu, Su Ping was able to further confirm that Su Anyong’s identity was as complex as he had thought. However, it also gave him some peace of mind. As long as his father was safe, he could naturally be at ease.\nTherefore, after settling down completely, Su Ping began to review his current gains.\nThe ten thousand Battle Merit Points, needless to say, were incredibly valuable. On the Legion’s internal website, even a Sun Crystal only required 1,100 Battle Merit Points for exchange. Ten thousand Battle Merit Points was indeed a substantial amount of resources. Moreover, resources obtained with these Battle Merit Points could be sold externally! A single Monarch Level material, when sold externally, could bring in tens of millions, possibly even several tens of millions. Although it seemed somewhat inappropriate to sell resources obtained with Battle Merit Points for money, he had no choice at the moment, given his financial situation.\nSu Ping’s eyes quickly scanned the Legion’s resource supply network. He soon found that within the Legion, some High-level resource exchanges were not attainable with just Battle Merit Points. Of course, this was not an issue for Su Ping. He had one first-class merit and one third-class merit.\nIn the Legion’s internal network, there were two distinctions for such resources. One required unlocking permissions, which one obtained by accumulating a certain number and grade of military merits. The other consisted of even more precious resources that required the use of military merits for exchange.",

As for the latter, even after using Battle Merit Points to exchange for resources, it didn’t mean the military merits vanished; they simply transformed into pure honor and achievements.\nSu Ping thought for a moment, swallowed, and then started searching within the Legion intranet.\nHe really had no idea about the names of any high-level materials before this.\nAnd this Legion intranet was quite a pain, as it didn’t directly provide a resource list. For high-level resources, one had to search for the specific resource name to view them.\nHowever, having experienced the Secret Realm of the Fengdu Sword King, Su Ping had seen a bit of the world.\nTherefore, in the search bar, Su Ping typed out one of the two Spiritual Level Resource names he knew:\n’Sword Intent Origin’\nAfter a second of loading, to Su Ping’s relief,\ndid this Legion intranet really have this item?!\n[Sword Intent Origin: A special Spiritual Level Resource. It is produced from Spirit Saint Level Sword Device type Pet Beasts. There’s a thirty percent chance such a Pet Beast will leave behind Sword Intent Origin upon its demise. This is an extremely precious Spiritual Level Resource. It can be used on Pet Beasts to significantly boost their comprehension of sword-type Skills. It can also be used by Beast Tamers. During a Level breakthrough, there is a certain chance to comprehend sword-related Space Characteristics and to lay the foundation for random sword-related resources.]\n[Exchange requirements: Exchanger must hold a mid-grade General Level military rank, or use two first-class merits and three second-class merits to gain eligibility to exchange for this item, consuming 300,000 Battle Merit Points.]\nSu Ping pursed his lips. He decisively shut down the Legion intranet. As for military rank, that likely had nothing to do with him for the rest of his life. Two first-class merits and three second-class merits were needed just to unlock eligibility for this exchange. And then it still required 300,000 Battle Merit Points?\nGive me a break.\nWith his current rank as an honorary major, Su Ping glanced at it; his monthly Battle Merit Points were 650.\nHis fixed annual income from Battle Merit Points was only around eight thousand.\nSo, even with a military rank and merits, to exchange for this Sword Intent Origin, he would have to save up for thirty or forty years?\nIs this what Spiritual Level Resources are like?\nSu Ping felt that exploring Secret Realms was more reliable and offered better chances.\nAfter all, putting other factors aside, even the rank of honorary major was not something ordinary people could achieve.\nAs for advancing further, he might really only be able to count on the training provided by the Special Beast Taming Forces.\nShaking his head, Su Ping stopped dwelling on impractical thoughts.\nInstead, he looked into the social benefits associated with his honorary major rank and military merits.\nThe more he looked, the brighter Su Ping’s eyes became, and the more excited he grew.\nPreviously, his father had mentioned that the honorary military rank came with many advantages. Su Ping hadn’t quite believed it then, but now it seemed his father hadn’t deceived him!\nInstantly, the exhaustion from the past few days vanished.\nSu Ping shot up to his feet. \"Uncle Guan!\"\nLao Guan’s figure had already disappeared. He probably still had some things to take care of at the base.\nSu Ping wasn’t in a hurry. He crossed through his base to the resort area. Just as he stepped into the central building, he almost bumped into someone.\nDong Muyun looked at the excited Su Ping. \"Eh? You’re back? What’s the rush?\"\nWhy is this woman still here? But this is perfect.\nSu Ping looked at Dong Muyun, who was clearly about to go out. \"Are you going to the city center?\"\nDong Muyun nodded.\n\"Great, take me with you! I’ve got some things to handle too.\"\n\"...\"\nAfter getting into Dong Muyun’s car, Su Ping looked it over and clicked his tongue. \"No wonder you always fly around on Yunning. Your car really isn’t up to par, is it?\"\nDong Muyun shot the brat a sideways glance, too lazy to bother with him. She’d heard he had gone to the Legion these past two days but had no idea what for.\n\"Since you’re heading back to the city center today, why aren’t you flying?\"\nDong Muyun gave him another sideways glance.\nWhat could she say? Could she admit that she had been flying too frequently lately, gotten flagged by the Beast Master Association, had all the points on her pilot’s license deducted by the Air Traffic Control Bureau, and was also fined over a hundred thousand?\nMiss Dong chose to change the subject. \"It’s so late. Where in Linzhou are you heading? And what for?\"\n\"The bank! To withdraw money!\" Su Ping suddenly became extremely excited.\nHe was going to have money! Was he finally going to have money?\nFor the past half a month, to train the Wanmu Wolves for those guys in the Legion, he had even postponed some of the Heart of Woods’ cultivation business.\nIf it weren’t for the one hundred million Dong Muyun had sponsored, many operations at Heart of Woods would have truly ground to a halt.\nAnd now, he was finally going to see the light at the end of the tunnel!\nDong Muyun looked at the exuberant Su Ping with a strange expression.\nHe’s going to have money? Since when did working for the Legion warrant payment? She had never heard of such a thing before.\nOne had to know, before that person took charge and started restructuring the Legion, the Dong Family also had some influence within the Legion, and they were somewhat familiar with the Legion’s situation.\nCould this be one of the details of the Legion reforms?\nDong Muyun’s interest was piqued. \"Okay, which bank?\"\n\"All of them!\"\nDong Muyun blinked and gave the young rascal a once-over. However, to satisfy her curiosity and get a peek at the inside story of the Legion’s current affairs, she nodded. \"Alright. We’ll start with Jianghai Bank, then go to Oriental Bank. Are you visiting the two big ones? The Cultivation Bank and the Beast Tamer Bank?\"\n\"Yes, all of them!\" Su Ping said resolutely.\nDong Muyun nodded, decisively taking on the role of driver and assistant.\nNot long after, she asked cheerfully, \"Want me to call the vice president who’s directly responsible for Tianyun’s account to come and assist you?\"\nNever one to pass up a freebie, Su Ping nodded. \"Sure.\"\nTianyun was a major corporation in Jianghai Province, and even in the eastern region of the Dragon Nation. Any reception, at any time, had to be handled impeccably.\nShe made one phone call. Even though that vice president was still at a dinner party, Dong Muyun’s call summoned him immediately.\nTwenty minutes later, the two of them got out of the car in front of the local Jianghai Bank in Jianghai Province.\nThe vice president, who had been waiting there, immediately put on an incredibly warm smile. Looking at Su Ping and Queen Dong exiting the car, he asked, \"Chairwoman Dong, is there any business you need me to handle?\"\n\"Not me. Him,\" Dong Muyun said, pointing at Su Ping.\nThe vice president was clearly no fool and, without any hint of neglect, promptly inquired, \"Sir, what business do you have with Jianghai Bank?\"\nFacing the vice president’s enthusiastic smile and Dong Muyun’s rather attentive gaze, Su Ping stated decisively, \"I want a loan! The kind without collateral and without interest!\"\nSeeing the young man’s confident expression, the vice president struggled to maintain his composure. After a moment, he couldn’t help but cast a doubtful glance at Dong Muyun.\nWas Queen Dong of Tianyun Group perhaps making fun of him?",

      "content": "Chapter 201: Chapter 139: Loans! The Cultivation and Perfection of Forest Wolf and Elf Wolf!\nDong Muyun really wanted to ignore the deputy bank president’s questioning gaze.\nBut it had to be said, Su Ping’s words also made it a bit hard for her to maintain her composure.\n\"Su Ping, loans always require collateral. Of course, you might have seen those so-called unsecured ones, but in reality, they’re secured by personal credit, and those loans can only support small amounts.\" Dong Muyun quickly understood his line of thinking.\nAfter all, no matter how talented Su Ping was, he wasn’t that old and perhaps didn’t know much about certain societal matters.\nIn such cases, having been short on funds before, learning about the possibility of a loan naturally energized him.\n\"As for interest-free, it’s the same deal: either your collateral is sufficient, or the amount is small. Otherwise, unless the interest is very low, it can be kept very low.\"\nWatching Dong Muyun patiently explain, the deputy bank president showed a smile that was both embarrassed and politely restrained.\nWas this all Queen Dong had dragged him here for?\nBut he couldn’t really say anything; after all, this was his job.\nBesides, for Queen Dong to explain things this way, this gentleman must be no ordinary person, right?\nSo, he quickly said, \"Chairman, let me speak with this gentleman. But let’s go inside to discuss it first.\"\nThey followed him into the office.\nIt was there that the deputy bank president said, \"Sir, with the Chairman present, I can use my authority to approve an interest-free, unsecured loan of up to 2,000,000 for you. Does that sound acceptable?\"\nThis showed that the deputy bank president indeed handled matters efficiently. He didn’t say much, simply using his own authority to help. Although it was out of respect for Dong Muyun, Su Ping still nodded in satisfaction.\nHowever, he shook his head. \"Not enough! Here’s the thing, my current status should allow me to apply for more interest-free, unsecured loans. Could you please check online? Here’s my ID card.\"\nThe deputy bank president felt somewhat helpless.\nDamn it, even as a deputy bank president using his own limit, he only had two million in interest-free, unsecured loans.\nAfter all, Jianghai Bank was just a local bank in Jianghai Province. It wasn’t one of the two major banks, was it?\nBesides, what kind of status would allow someone to borrow a large interest-free, unsecured loan from the bank?\nEven for Dong Muyun standing before him, it would be impossible.\nBecause such things always entailed risk.\nEven with the resources of Tianyun Group, it would be very, very difficult to casually obtain loans of a large magnitude.\nAnd now this young man was saying his status could secure more loans?\nHaving worked at Jianghai Bank for so many years, the deputy bank president hadn’t encountered such a situation.\nBut still, out of respect for Dong Muyun, he didn’t say anything more. He took the ID card, said softly, \"Please wait a moment,\" and then turned on the computer that had been shut down.\nIt was Dong Muyun, however, who looked oddly at Su Ping. \"You rascal, after all this time, your method of getting money is to take out a loan?\"\nNo wonder she was speechless.\nHow much money could a loan possibly provide?\nUnless this darn kid was going to reveal their family’s secret cultivation techniques, in which case he could undoubtedly secure a sky-high loan. Otherwise, even for the Heart of Woods cultivation base, the most one could borrow would be a few tens of millions at best.\nBut how much could be lent on an interest-free, unsecured basis?\nJust as this thought crossed her mind, and before Su Ping could reply, a crisp exclamation echoed through the empty office.\n\"What the heck?\"\nDong Muyun looked toward the office desk, where the deputy bank president sat, looking as if he’d seen a ghost.\n\"What’s wrong?\"\nFor the first time, the deputy bank president didn’t respond to his benefactor’s question. Instead, he rubbed his eyes as if he had misread something, then stared fixedly at the computer screen again.\nOnly then did his expression, still like he’d seen a ghost, turn back toward Su Ping, who was sitting there.\nFinally, still with that same look, as if he’d seen a ghost, he remained stunned, not coming back to his senses for a long time.\nIt had to be said, Su Ping was also somewhat nervous. Although the introduction to the honorary military rank and the effects of the medals had mentioned some figures, Su Ping was still unclear about the exact numbers.\nObserving the deputy bank president’s expression, Dong Muyun raised her eyebrows slightly. \"What’s the matter?\"\nThe deputy bank president gave a wry smile, then quickly stood up. He respectfully handed Su Ping’s ID card back.\n\"I apologize, Major Su. I was impolite earlier. With your honorary military rank and your personal credit rating, you’re eligible for an interest-free, unsecured loan of 30,000,000 at our bank! Additionally, since you’ve been awarded a First-Class Merit and a Third-Class Merit, as per our bank’s policy, an additional 31,000,000 in interest-free, unsecured loans will be granted on top of the initial 30,000,000! That’s a total of 61,000,000 in interest-free loans, offered in gratitude for your service and contribution to the Legion and to the Dragon Nation! Salute to you!\"\nAnd it was no empty platitude. After those final words were spoken, genuine goosebumps rose on Su Ping’s skin.\nHe had never felt anything like this before.\nMoreover, this wasn’t just verbal respect; it came with real, tangible benefits!\nJust one bank could directly approve over sixty million in loans?\nIt was something Su Ping hadn’t expected.\nThis was also a difference between the Controlling Beasts world and his previous life.\nIn that world, while the respect and preferential treatment for soldiers, especially for decorated heroes, were also plentiful,",

      "content": "Chapter 202: Chapter 139: Loans! The Cultivation and Perfection of Forest Wolf and Elf Wolf!_2\nBut it must be said, often, it’s genuine gold and silver that are most heartwarming.\nHowever, this was also normal. Generally speaking, in the Beastmaster Society, Beast Tamers who had made achievements in the Legion, and especially those who had obtained the extremely rare honorary military ranks, were usually not short on money. This so-called interest-free loan was just a small gesture for emergencies. But it indeed resolved Su Ping’s big trouble.\nHe took his identity card with satisfaction, turned his head, and saw Dong Muyun beside him, her bright red lips parted, looking at him with an expression as if she had seen a ghost ever since the vice president began speaking.\nMajor Su? An honorary title? A first-class merit? A third-class merit? What the hell was all this about?\nSu Ping had indeed visited the Legion, but hadn’t it only been for two days? Could some powerful Time-Series Pet Beast have activated its Ability, causing *her* perception of time to slow? Had many days actually passed? That was pure nonsense! In other words, had Su Ping really achieved all these things within just two days in the Legion? How had he done it?\nShe naturally understood what a first-class merit represented. It implied that anyone who had any ill intentions toward Su Ping would have to consider whether they might offend the Legion. In the Dragon Nation, even if you offended the Beast Master Association, you absolutely could not offend the Legion in this regard. This was because, within the entire Dragon Nation, the Beast Master Association wasn’t a monolith; it had many factions. But the Legion was different. Especially when it came to a decorated hero; if anyone dared to act against them without just cause, no established family would want to directly confront the Legion. Moreover, was this really a first-class decorated hero? If a first-class hero of the Legion met with an accident while on duty and the Legion did nothing, how could it maintain military morale and fighting spirit? How could it reassure the Beast Tamer warriors who were stationed far from the cities, in the desolate borderlands, resisting the Beast Tides of wild Pet Beasts and risking their lives? But, ultimately, it all came down to the same question: where on earth did this brat get these things? Was he truly capable of earning such high-level military honors?\nDong Muyun looked at Su Ping with a strange expression, but Su Ping had already joyfully received the answer he wanted from the vice president.\n\"Major Su, please understand that regardless of anything, procedures must be followed. I’ve already reported it directly. This loan should be in your hands in the next day or two!\"\n\"Not at all, not at all! Thank you for your hard work, much appreciated!\" Su Ping said, smiling eagerly.\nAfter all, this was the God of Wealth approving his funds; being a little polite was hardly an issue.\nThe vice president, however, felt extremely flattered.\nHe might appear distinguished, but he was just a member of the management system. He might have a high salary and social status, and even a comfortable fortune at home if he employed a few tricks. But in the Beastmaster Society, status and power were far more useful than money. If it had been an ordinary recent graduate, the vice president wouldn’t have batted an eye, not even deeming them worthy of a second glance. But who was this person before him? Who on earth had ever seen an eighteen-year-old honorary major? A recipient of first-class and third-class merits? Not to mention, being treated with such consideration by the chairman of Tianyun Group indicated his own status was undoubtedly exceptional. In the hierarchy of the Beastmaster Society, from the perspective of influential figures like Dong Muyun, a branch vice president like himself was merely an administrative staffer. There were plenty of such personnel vying for positions. To Dong Muyun and this Major Su, he was perhaps just a slightly more high-ranking attendant, nothing more. Yet, who would have thought this young major would be so courteous to *him*?\nFor a moment, whether from the earlier drinks or sheer excitement, the vice president’s cheeks flushed red, his face alight with uncontrollable exhilaration and joy.\n\"It is my honor to be of service to you, Major Su. I also thank Chairman Dong for giving me this opportunity.\"\nHis face beaming, he respectfully escorted Dong Muyun and Su Ping out of Jianghai Bank.\nAfter getting into the car, Dong Muyun finally remarked with a sigh, \"I must say, I’ve never seen Vice President Fu so eager and excited before.\"\nSu Ping nodded. \"Being a vice president really is a waste of his talents.\"\nDong Muyun shot him a sideways glance. \"His surname is indeed Fu. However, if you’ve taken a liking to him and wish to cultivate a connection, it’s just a matter of calling President Qin. Although the Beast Master Association doesn’t meddle much in administrative management, as the highest local authority, a small thing like this is merely a word from the old man and a phone call.\"\nSu Ping waved his hand. \"Forget it, forget it. I don’t have that kind of pull.\"\n\"What exactly did you do at the Legion these past two days?\" Dong Muyun finally couldn’t resist asking.\n\"I participated in a competition, used the Pet Beast I’d cultivated, and just casually took first place, that’s all,\" Su Ping said nonchalantly. He had no interest in elaborating on the matter with Dong Muyun, so he just gave a brief overview.\nDong Muyun wasn’t foolish. She gave him a complicated look.\nWinning first place in the Legion’s competition equates to a first-class merit? There must be more to it.\nBut since Su Ping wasn’t elaborating, she couldn’t press further.\nBesides, many matters within the Legion were indeed best left unsaid.",

      "content": "Chapter 203: Chapter 139: Loans! The Cultivation and Perfection of Forest Wolf and Elf Wolf!_3\nToo many taboos.\n\"Head to the next bank?\"\n\"Yeah! Let’s see if I can continue.\"\nWhen it came to such actions of exploiting loopholes, Su Ping was exhilarated. Although it was a loan that he would have to repay in the future after making money, these funds could undoubtedly greatly accelerate the construction of his Heart of Woods at present.\nThinking of this, Su Ping felt incredibly invigorated.\nThus, Dong Muyun continued fulfilling her role as his chauffeur, driving to Jianghai Bank, the Oriental Bank, the Beast Tamer Bank, and the Breeder Bank! Su Ping visited all four. Afterwards, he had secured nearly four hundred million in interest-free, unsecured loans!\nThe sixty-one million from Jianghai Bank was actually the least. This was understandable, considering it was a local bank and not one spread across the entire Dragon Nation. The Oriental Bank lent a bit more, but it wasn’t particularly high either—a loan of seventy-two million.\nThe Beast Tamer Bank and the Breeder Bank, these two behemoths, were the real heavy hitters. The Beast Tamer Bank approved a whole one hundred million.\nAn honorary military rank was even more valuable than the regular ranks within the Legion. Even if Zhang Lie and Lin Lei came, with nothing but talk, they wouldn’t dream of getting such a large interest-free loan; of course, the Legion wouldn’t allow it either, unless there was genuinely a special difficulty. Su Ping, however, had no such worries.\nAs for the Breeder Bank, that was even more unexpected for Su Ping. Besides the honorary military rank and military medals, something else increased his loan limit: his status as an Intermediate Breeder. Then, a total of one hundred and fifty million was approved.\nBanks are really loaded,\nSu Ping thought.\nSitting in Dong Muyun’s car, Su Ping, who would have three hundred and eighty-three million in loans arriving in his account in the next day or two, couldn’t help but sigh with emotion.\nDong Muyun rolled her eyes at him. \"They’re not running a charity. Even though it’s an interest-free, unsecured loan, don’t forget you have to repay it! Let’s see when you can manage that.\"\nSpeaking of which, Su Ping really did feel a bit of a headache coming on.\nWith the Legion’s issues resolved and some time still before he had to attend the Breeder competition in the Magic Capital, he wasn’t in a hurry. So, in the period before the end of the year, his top priorities were indeed perfecting his own breeding focus, building the Heart of Woods, practicing meditation, and further researching money-making schemes.\nWithout an official announcement, he couldn’t release the evolutionary cultivation method for the Wanmu Wolf and couldn’t fleece the rich through genuine high-end cultivation. If he only relied on the Heart of Woods and the resort for income, accumulating such a huge sum of money would indeed be difficult.\nCurrently, among my own ventures, making money by fishing with Rainbow Coral Worms is definitely one aspect,\nSu Ping mused.\nBut what about cultivation?\nAt this thought, Su Ping remembered the cultivation task for the Forest Wolf and Elf Wolf that Dong Muyun had entrusted to him.\nIndeed, both of these are quite suitable.\nMoreover, previously, by observing the cultivation methods for these two common evolutionary bodies through the Myriad Spirits Catalog, Su Ping had made some additional discoveries.\nWith these thoughts, Su Ping closed his eyes on the ride back.\nDong Muyun, driving while sneakily watching him, felt her anger flare up.\nDamn it, does this little brat really think of me, Miss Dong, as his chauffeur and assistant?\nHowever, Dong Muyun had no choice. After leaving the Breeder Bank, she drove Su Ping back towards the Heart of Woods on the outskirts of Linzhou.\nAfter running around all evening, this brat didn’t even offer to buy me a meal? Now it’s so late, I haven’t done any of my own things, just been dragged around by this kid. Right, what was I supposed to do when I got back to Linzhou City Center?\nDong Muyun scratched her head. Then, deciding not to bother with it anymore, she drove straight towards the Heart of Woods base on the outskirts of Linzhou.\nSu Ping was truly unaware of this Queen Dong’s thoughts. His entire mind and attention were focused on the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas that had emerged in his mind.\nIt was still the very familiar Forest Wolf Catalog, but this time, there was a significant change! The biggest change was the Experience Points!\nTwo months had passed. Although there were a few days when Su Ping didn’t interact much with the Forest Wolf, causing the accumulation of Experience Points to slow down, over this ’long’ period, the Experience Points in the Forest Wolf Catalog had indeed made unimaginable progress.\nBesides experience, there were also two other relatively conspicuous special changes!\n[Catalog: Forest Wolf]\n[A special Wolf Tribe adept with the Wood Attribute, possessing incredibly strong Life Force. Adult Forest Wolves are typically Elite Level and are skilled in Skills such as: Sunlight Absorption, Vine Strangling, Self-Healing, and Accelerated Growth.]\n[Current Catalog Level: 3 (8,210/20,000)]\nKnown Evolutionary Atlas, special cultivation:\n[Universal Cultivation Method - Accelerated Casting: ...]\n[Forest Wolf-specific Magic Potion - Heart of Woods: ...]\n[Special Cultivation Evolutionary Body - Wanmu Wolf: ...]\n[Discovered Forest Wolf Cultivation Evolutionary Body: Forest Wolf! Consume 800 Experience Points to further perfect the Forest Wolf’s perfect Evolution Law, increasing the success rate of cultivation evolution and, to a certain extent, enhancing the potential of the successfully evolved Forest Wolf!]\n[Discovered Forest Wolf Cultivation Evolutionary Body: Elf Wolf! Consume 1,200 Experience Points to further perfect the Elf Wolf’s perfect Evolution Law, increasing the success rate of cultivation evolution and, to a certain extent, enhancing the potential of the successfully evolved Elf Wolf!]\nHabits and preferences:\n[...]\nJournal records:\n[...]\nThat was right. Aside from the Experience Points, when Su Ping saw the Cultivation Methods for the Forest Wolf and the Elf Wolf, the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas had once again provided such prompts. These involved further perfecting the Evolution Law for both, significantly increasing the chances of successful cultivation, while also enhancing the potential of the resulting Evolutionary Bodies.\nHowever, Su Ping hadn’t paid much attention to this before, as he was busy with the cultivation and training of the Wanmu Wolf.\nNow that the Legion’s matters were temporarily concluded, it was time for him to truly expand the cultivation business at his Heart of Woods!",

      "content": "Chapter 204: Chapter 140: The Laboratory! Reigniting the Research on Nicotiana lupulina!\nIn the darkness of night, at the heart of Linzhou City, on the thirty-second floor of a skyscraper by the window, a man supported his chin with his hand. He gazed at the night view of Linzhou City without a trace of appreciation in his eyes, displaying instead weariness and impatience.\nAfter checking his watch countless times, just as he was about to lose his patience and make a phone call, at last, the distinct CLACK, CLACK, CLACK of high heels approached from outside the private room.\nThe door to the room was pushed open, and Dong Muyun’s figure appeared.\nThe man finally spoke. \"Three hours ago was our agreed time, right? In other words, Dong Muyun, you are a full three hours late!\"\nDong Muyun was unfazed, not even bothering with a perfunctory apology. She simply shrugged. \"Something came up unexpectedly.\"\n\"What could possibly be more important than my affairs?\"\nDong Muyun sat down, crossed one leg casually over the other, and said, \"Much more important than your business, Dong Mutian. If you’ve got something to say, spit it out. I don’t have time to play guessing games with you here.\"\nThe man looked at his sister, who hadn’t changed over the many years, and the impatience and irritation on his face surprisingly vanished. He said, \"Father’s orders. I’ve come to temporarily take over two subsidiaries under Tianyun Group: Tianyun Real Estate and Mirror Sky Entertainment.\"\n\"What?\" Dong Muyun raised her eyebrows in disbelief, looking at Dong Mutian. She asked, \"Are these Father’s orders?\"\n\"You can call and ask!\"\nDong Muyun’s brows furrowed. Right in front of Dong Mutian, she made the call.\n\"Dad?\"\n\"Has your brother arrived?\"\nThe voice on the phone, along with its words, clearly confirmed Dong Mutian’s claims.\nYet Dong Muyun found it even harder to understand. She asked, \"Dad, what does this mean? Haven’t I been managing Tianyun all this time?\"\nThere was a moment of silence on the other end of the line. After about a dozen breaths, a muffled voice continued, \"Muyun, the family is preparing to focus all its efforts on developing Tianyun Group. Other areas will make way for now. Tianyun Group is so vast, and it’s just the right time for Mutian to help you share some of the burden. Besides, real estate and entertainment aren’t our main industries...\"\nDong Muyun’s fox-like eyes narrowed. She nodded decisively and said, \"Fine, I get it...\"\nShe didn’t wait for a response, hanging up abruptly to vent her dissatisfaction.\nThen, under Dong Mutian’s amused gaze, she settled back into her seat, resuming her pose with one leg casually crossed over the other.\n\"Asked him already?\" Dong Mutian said. \"Over the past few years, the group’s financial reports haven’t just failed to improve; they’ve shown losses. The real estate side has lost over a hundred million on the Crescent Lake construction and that Yuntian Resort. Father has long been dissatisfied...\"\nLooking at her smug, good-for-nothing brother, Dong Muyun scoffed disdainfully. She retorted, \"Problems with the Legion? Kicked out, were you?\"\nAt this, Dong Mutian’s face darkened.\nDong Muyun huffed and said, \"Do you know why you’ll never be the true heir in Father’s and the family’s hearts? Dong Mutian, even without Dong Muxuan, and with me here, the ambitions you and your dead mother harbor—to truly head the Dong Family and take over—will never happen in this lifetime! It’s because you’re such a worthless good-for-nothing.\"\nBOOM!\nThe table in front of them was sent flying by an explosive burst of spiritual power.\nDong Mutian abruptly stood up, staring intently at the woman before him.\nDong Muyun, however, didn’t seem to care in the slightest. Instead, she laughed and said, \"Alright, alright, as if I don’t know your capabilities. Enough of the show. It seems the pressure this time was really significant for a complete waste of the family like you to be driven out of the Legion.\"\nWith that, Dong Muyun slowly rose, waved her hand, and walked straight out of the private room.\nReaching the doorway, she seemed to remember something. She turned her head back to Dong Mutian and said, \"Come to the group’s headquarters tomorrow. I’ll have someone show you how to take over the real estate and entertainment companies...\"\nAfter leaving these words behind, Dong Muyun’s figure finally disappeared from the private room, leaving Dong Mutian, whose expression had turned a slight shade more pleasant.\nHe really hadn’t expected Dong Muyun to be so accommodating, handing over the management rights of the two companies to him just like that?\nBut who knew if there was some other trick up her sleeve.\nIndeed, that was the case. As soon as Dong Muyun stepped out of the room, her previously breezy demeanor vanished, her face turning extremely grim.\nThe company she took over at sixteen, building it up step by step to its current state—was she really going to hand it over to someone else?\nWhat had the family said back then?\nHer eldest brother, Dong Mutian, was to strive within the Legion, carving out influence within the official power structures of the Dragon Nation. Dong Muyun was responsible for the entire family’s commercial ventures. Although she had leveraged the family’s connections and power, consolidating those myriad small shops and subsidiaries into the behemoth that Tianyun Group had become was a feat that had cost her unimaginable effort and youth. As for Dong Muxuan, over a decade younger than his siblings, he was still studying at the Magic Capital Advanced Beast-Taming Academy.\nLooking at it now, the family’s situation was indeed not good.\nAt this thought, Dong Muyun’s expression slowly returned to coldness. That person, over the past few years, had brought the suppression of Families to an extreme. Before this, the Dong Family’s status and influence had been Dong Muyun’s greatest support and strength.",

This was especially true in recent years; in Jianghai, it would have been tolerable, but in the entire eastern region of Dragon Nation...\nA glint of light flashed in Dong Muyun’s eyes.\nShe suddenly thought of the somewhat joking collaboration she had with Su Ping.\nFor a moment, after she got into the car, Dong Muyun gazed at the passenger seat Su Ping had just occupied and fell into deep thought.\nThe Dong Family had never truly believed in her!\nDong Muyun had always known this; otherwise, her position as the acting chairman with shares wouldn’t have been limited to just five percent of Tianyun Group.\nThe majority was in the hands of her grandfather and father.\nMoreover, Dong Muyun knew better than anyone that business strategies and territorial control—whether within Dragon Nation or even across Blue Star—might not hold as much significance or utility as one might think.\nIt wasn’t that it was useless, but her position, especially in the Dong Family, could be replaced at any time.\nMoney, the company’s sales channels—these were all to serve strength!\nWhat about her two brothers?\nEven a failure like Dong Mutian was pressured by the Dong Family to join the Legion.\nWith the help of the Dong Family, if Dong Mutian could perform well, what could he gain? High-level Legion contacts, significant personal power growth.\nHe would also have the chance to break into the management layer of Dragon Nation in the future, which was the traditional path for major families.\nNot to mention Dong Muxuan, who was directly sent to the Magic Capital Beast Taming Academy and became the disciple of the sole Sky Hunter King in Magic Capital.\nHe was establishing himself firmly within the academy and its corresponding factions.\nOnly her!\nEven within Tianyun Group, her hands were tied; she had to report the mobilization and use of even slightly higher-level resources.\nWhy?\nNow that Dong Mutian had messed up in the Legion, he wanted to continue leeching off the territory she had fought for all these years? How could she possibly accept this?\nFinally, Dong Muyun let out a long sigh.\nSometimes, a catalyst is needed to make up one’s mind and take that step forward.\n「...」\nSu Ping didn’t know that this night was an extremely important one for Dong Muyun.\nHe, on the other hand, had slept soundly.\nThe issue with money had been temporarily resolved, and he had returned to his own home.\nThere’s no place like home.\nBut Su Ping woke up quickly. This was because, early in the morning, Liu Fuhai had eagerly called him.\n\"Hurry up and sign for it; I’ve brought you stuff!\"\nSu Ping, still in his sleep robe and without even washing up, walked out the door, glancing skeptically toward the entrance.\nWith that one look, the little sleepiness lingering in Su Ping vanished without a trace.\nThere were large shipping containers.\nEach container was open, and looking inside, one could see gleaming metal machinery.\nVarious kinds of mechanical devices, even in places where sunlight couldn’t reach, still sparkled in Su Ping’s mind.\n’High-Polymer Automated Mechanical Core Compression Extraction Machine’\n’Biological Central Computer’\n’Liquid Nitrogen Storage Device’\n’Basic Molecular Purification Instrument’\n’Precision Gene Gun’\n’...’\nAll sorts of equipment he had previously only seen in pictures on the Breeder Association’s website were now vividly present before his eyes.\nOld Liu is impressive! All this in one night? It was a good thing I remained steadfast and wasn’t swayed by offers from breeders in other provinces after the competition.\n\"Kid, where are we putting all this stuff?\" Vice President Liu’s voice came from behind him.\nHe was very pleased with Su Ping’s excited, wide-eyed expression.\nIt reassured him that the items from the Breeder Association were not just going to sit and collect dust.\nThough, he didn’t understand what this brat wanted these things for, or what on earth he was going to do with them!\n\"Follow me, follow me!\"\nAt this moment, Su Ping felt somewhat relieved.\nFortunately, when he previously cultivated the Wanmu Wolf of the Legion, the transformation of the Heart of Woods had reached a bottleneck due to a lack of money.\nHowever, beyond the forest of the Heart of Woods, the area Su Ping had planned to use as a base for his experimental lab had already been constructed.\nNow it can finally be put to use!\nLiu Fuhai once again stored the experimental equipment inside his Beast Taming Space.\nAfterward, he followed Su Ping through the Heart of Woods and arrived at this newly constructed lab.\n\"Good lad, you were already prepared, weren’t you?\"\nLooking at the lab, Liu Fuhai nodded with satisfaction.\nThen, following the plan Su Ping had prepared, they moved all the delicate experimental machinery into the lab.\nAfter familiarizing Su Ping with the use of these instruments and returning to the guest room with him, Liu Fuhai couldn’t help but ask, \"What are your current research directions? Is there anything I can help with?\"\nIf an ordinary Breeder heard that, they’d probably be ecstatic. But there’s really nothing he can help me with,\nSu Ping thought.However, he indeed had quite a few research projects going on lately.\nThe completion of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas entries for the Forest Wolf and the elite wolf didn’t require much active research from him.\nI’m not the squeamish type to refuse to use my Golden Finger.\nSecondly, there was the research on Wolf Tobacco.\nHowever, I don’t even know if this Wolf Tobacco research will yield any results. I’d feel pretty bad wasting Vice President Liu’s time on it.\nAs for the most important thing, that’s undoubtedly the Wanmu Wolf’s so-called Super-Rank Skill. But according to the Sun Formula, my main focus next is still on cultivating and improving Old Sha’s Heart of Woods skills.\nBesides these, there’s also the research into the Paperman’s evolution and Qian Yi’s evolutionary cultivation. However, these aren’t things Vice President Liu can help with. After all, he’s a Wolf Pet Breeder, not a Breeder of the Necromancy Series.\nSo, facing Old Liu’s expectant gaze, Su Ping felt a bit awkward and scratched his head.\nOld Liu immediately understood and gave Su Ping a wry look. \"I’ll just take it that you’re sparing me the worry. But don’t forget the important stuff; I’m waiting for you to become famous across the world!\"\nFamous across the world?!\nThose words made Su Ping’s heart quiver.\nHe naturally understood what Old Liu meant and nodded with a smile. \"Rest assured!\"\nVice President Liu was, of course, reassured. Right now, in the entire Breeder Association, there was probably no one who gave him more peace of mind than Su Ping.\nHowever, after a pause, Old Liu finally spoke up, \"Su Ping, what are your plans for the Wanmu Wolf’s Cultivation Method?\"\nPlans for it?\nSu Ping understood Vice President Liu’s meaning at once.\nHe pondered for a moment.\nActually, I haven’t placed much importance on the Wanmu Wolf’s cultivation and evolutionary method. It’s not that the Wanmu Wolf’s evolutionary form is strong on its own; it’s strong because I fortuitously discovered the Sun Formula and combined it with the Wanmu Wolf. Others cultivating the Wanmu Wolf definitely wouldn’t reach the strength and standard I have. And there’s another reason: strictly speaking, the Wanmu Wolf’s evolution doesn’t solely belong to me. Sun Chaoju also has a share in it. As the discoverer who handed over all findings and the cultivation process to me, Sun Chaoju has every right to know about the Wanmu Wolf’s Cultivation Method. With my current status, I could certainly exclude Sun Chaoju completely. But again, it’s not worth it. And it would be unseemly. I do care about my reputation. An evolutionary method might seem precious to others, but with the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, it doesn’t really count for much to me.\nSo, Su Ping thought for a while and said, \"About that, after Breeder Sun arrives, we can discuss it a bit more before making a decision. I don’t really lack anything right now, and as for exchanging credits for resources, I don’t have any particular goals at the moment.\"\nLiu Fuhai nodded, his face showing pleased relief. \"Alright, I’ll mention it to Xiao Sun and have him come here to discuss it with you.\"\nAfter respectfully seeing off Vice President Liu, Su Ping couldn’t hold back any longer. He jumped up and sprinted back to his now crammed-full lab!\nThis is a lab that truly belongs to me! It was one of my dreams from over two months ago! I didn’t expect to achieve it so easily! Setting other matters aside, those stocks of Wolf Tobacco I’ve accumulated can finally be put to good use!",

This way I can focus on meditation and cultivating Pet Beasts, striving to surpass you as soon as possible!\"\nQin Xiaoxue consoled herself and then continued to rationalize in her mind.\nIn order to surpass Grandma sooner and become a powerful Beast Tamer, it’s only right to find a formidable Breeder to help, right?\nAfter figuring it out, Qin Xiaoxue, with her high ponytail swaying, finally left the office.\nThe woman smiled as she watched her little bok choy leave, and then she took out her phone and dialed a number.\n\"Qin Chuan.\"\n\"Hello, Mom, what’s up?\"\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"Well... I’m receiving a top-tier High Order Breeder from Eagle Country. He’s also from our Dragon Nation, and actually from Jianghai—kind of like a fellow townsman of Father’s, hehe. He plans to visit Linzhou once he’s done with his business in Magic Capital.\"\nThe woman’s brows furrowed, but after a pause, she said, \"From now on, you don’t have to worry about Xiao Xue’s matters anymore. You hear me?\"\n\"Mom, I...\"\n\"Did you hear me?\"\n\"Yes...\"\nThe woman then continued, \"Also, don’t always be preoccupied with those businesses and assets. Dragon Nation is not Eagle Country across the ocean; those things aren’t as important here. Additionally, you can have contact with people from other nations, but don’t get too intimately involved.\"\nThe woman took a moment before she added, \"This is a reminder from me as your mother.\"\nHowever, after a pause, a voice replied from the other end of the phone, \"I understand, Lord Sang Sheng.\"\n「...」\n\"What? You want to partner with me to register a company?\"\nA few days later, Su Ping, in a white lab coat and reeking of a mix of Wolf Tobacco and wolf dung, sat once again in front of Dong Muyun.\nSu Ping looked at the woman with suspicion—what exactly did she want?\nDong Muyun nodded. \"I’ve had all the stock of water element barriers you needed transported to you. They were originally intended for Crescent Island, but they’re no longer needed there, so I’m giving them to you at a bargain price. Meanwhile, I wanted to hear your opinion.\"\nUpon hearing the mention of water element barriers, Su Ping’s eyes lit up.\nHowever, he still looked at the woman warily. \"How much?\"\n\"If you agree, it’s free.\"\nSu Ping instinctively shrank back. \"Then I disagree.\"\nExperience had taught him that in this world, the most expensive things are those that are free.\nDong Muyun’s brow slightly furrowed, and then she said resignedly, \"Su Ping, Heart of Woods is actually quite large and has a lot of potential, but it’s just too informal. With your abilities...\"\nSu Ping raised his hand, stopping Dong Muyun from continuing. \"Heart of Woods isn’t mine alone. Spit it out, why are you looking to partner with me to start a company?\"\nDong Muyun’s visit was quite strange. She clearly had some hidden agenda or there was more to it.\nDong Muyun looked deeply at the young man. He didn’t seem as young as his appearance suggested. How on earth did his brain develop?\nDong Muyun didn’t conceal anything and recounted everything about Dong Mutian.\nThis time, Su Ping was intrigued. \"Wow, so the struggle among the children of wealthy families is real?\"\nDong Muyun rolled her eyes at him.\nSu Ping nodded. \"So, you’re looking to step out of the Dong Family to go solo and then cooperate with me? What industry do you plan to get into?\"\n\"Of course, it’s Pet Beast breeding, which you’re best at!\"\nSu Ping looked bemused at Dong Muyun, who took it for granted.\nShe shrugged. \"Though it seems like you’re not interested in cooperating?\"\nLet alone the fact that Heart of Woods wasn’t his alone; even if it were, Su Ping wouldn’t want to slave away to corporatize it in this field.\nHowever, if this could lead to forming a company in some other industry, Su Ping was indeed quite interested.\nIt was the general trend of the times, after all. Developing a side business was quite necessary.\nConveniently, Su Ping had recently made some research discoveries that seemed like they could potentially develop into a side business.\nThus, Su Ping looked at Dong Muyun. \"Does Tianyun Group have any involvement in Magic Potion industries?\"\nDong Muyun was slightly taken aback but nodded. \"Tianyun encompasses everything related to Pet Beast breeding, so of course, that includes Magic Potions. What about it?\"\n\"I could indeed consider collaborating with you, but I won’t manage anything. I can provide you with the formula patents; production, sales—you’ll have to handle all of it yourself. How about it?\"\nDong Muyun’s gaze narrowed slightly, looking at Su Ping in disbelief. \"You’ve made another new research discovery? A Magic Potion?\"\nCurrently, Dong Muyun dared not underestimate this young man in the slightest. This kid was too frightening; the result with the Wanmu Wolf was the best example. Not to mention, he was now an honorary major of some Legion and a first-class merit award recipient. If her elder brother had achieved even half of what Su Ping had in the Legion these past few years—or rather, in the few days Su Ping had been involved—he wouldn’t have been unceremoniously kicked out with his tail between his legs.\nWho could fathom what secrets and treasures lay buried in that incredible brain, so starkly different from ordinary people’s?\nSo, Dong Muyun was immediately interested.\nSu Ping nodded. \"It’s not completely formulated yet, but I estimate it will be ready in a day or two.\"\n\"What kind of Magic Potion is it? What’s its name?\" Dong Muyun’s eyes gleamed with excitement.\nSu Ping just smiled slightly.",

      "content": "Chapter 211: Chapter 142: He’s Not From the Same World as You!_3\nOne was the bored Vice President Liu, and another was Ding Yan, the Senior Breeder of the Flame Wolf and developer of the Ashen Wolf Lord, whom Su Ping had encountered in the Legion a few days prior.\nThe last one, Su Ping only found familiar. He was likely one of the Intermediate Breeders from when Vice President Liu had given a lecture. However, Su Ping had no significant interaction with him, knew little about him, and didn’t even remember his name clearly.\n\"The Flame Wolf’s temperament is volatile, so to approach and command it, one needs a profound understanding of its habits.\"\n\"Here in Jianghai Province, Teacher Liu once discussed the simplest method of bonding with a Flame Wolf...\"\nIn the partitioned room, a Flame Wolf Breeder from Jianghai Province was chattering incessantly to the Breeders from Huaiyang Province who had come for the exchange.\nHowever, the Junior Breeders from Huaiyang below clearly weren’t paying the slightest attention.\nBecause the teacher leading their team this time was a Senior Breeder of the Flame Wolf, speaking of these matters in front of him was like performing a sword dance in front of Guan Yu.\nEven Vice President Liu hadn’t developed his own new Evolutionary Body for the Flame Wolf. So, in their hearts, when it came to expertise on the Flame Wolf—aside from other Pet Beasts—it was better to listen more to their own teacher.\nNeither Tian Xinghuo, the Breeder sitting at the head of the table, nor Vice President Liu cared much anymore.\nThis exchange, supposedly for sharing ideas, was in reality an opportunity for the Breeders from Huaiyang Province to show off.\nBut it had to be said, some promising young talent had indeed appeared this time.\nThe young man with sword-like brows and star-bright eyes, who had previously spoken of the Forest Wolf’s low cultivation value, was particularly noteworthy. He was a disciple of an equally high-ranking Senior Breeder from Huaiyang Province.\nReportedly, he had successfully cultivated the ’Temperature Elevation’ Skill for a Molten Canine.\nHad the success rate not been so low, perhaps this 19-year-old lad could already have become an Intermediate Breeder over in Huaiyang Province.\nThere were one or two others in the team with similar achievements, but their contributions weren’t as valuable or significant as the Molten Canine’s ’Temperature Elevation’ Skill.\nPreviously, Vice President Liu had been quite envious of Huaiyang Province for producing so much promising young talent. But now, Old Liu was indifferent. He regarded these youngsters with a calm, detached gaze, as if observing a passing breeze.\nThe gap between one genius and another is even greater than that between a genius and an ordinary person. In his heart, ten thousand of these so-called cultivation geniuses didn’t amount to a fart when compared to Su Ping.\nDing Yan seemed to feel the same way. Since returning from the Legion, he had lost the desire to show off, and his attitude toward the Jianghai Province Breeder Association had somewhat improved.\nIt was only these youngsters he’d brought along who clearly hadn’t realized what had transpired. They still carried an air of superiority, not particularly caring about the Breeders from Jianghai Province.\nA bunch of little brats who have yet to be battered by society and have never seen a real genius. Look at Su Ping. He possesses such talent and ability, yet not a trace of arrogance. His entire focus is on the cultivation of Pet Beasts.\nAfter such reflections, when they looked back at these youngsters, everyone adopted a more laissez-faire attitude.\nThe current situation was no different. However, as Old Liu was teasing the Flame Wolf at his side, he glanced up and was momentarily taken aback. His eyes lit up when he saw two figures outside the high-temperature glass.\nHe quickly stood up, briskly opened the door, and let Su Ping enter.\n\"Su Ping, what brings you here?\"\nBefore Old Liu could speak, Ding Yan, who had also noticed Su Ping, spoke up.\nAll eyes turned to the two newcomers.\nThey recognized Sun Chaoju, the Intermediate Breeder of Forest Wolves, who was with the newcomer. He had spoken to them about the pros and cons of the Forest Wolf before, but they had been utterly uninterested.\nThe person next to Sun Chaoju, however, was a young man around their age.\nDoes our Teacher Ding know him? And to be so enthusiastic? Didn’t their teacher say that these Breeders from Jianghai Province were all incompetents, only good at infighting, petty individuals with no ambition?\nSu Ping smiled slightly. \"Senior Ding is here too. I have something to discuss with Old Liu.\"\n\"What is it?\" Old Liu asked with a smile, glancing at Ding Yan from the corner of his eye.\nLittle bastard, still dare to look down on us Breeders from Jianghai Province?\n\"I’m working on an experimental project, and I don’t have many wolf-type Pet Beasts at my place. So, I came to our association to borrow some Pet Beasts for the experiment. I’d also like you to take a look to prevent any accidents.\"\nAn experiment!? Not only did Liu Fuhai’s eyes light up, but Ding Yan’s did as well. Wolf-type Pet Beasts—obviously, this was an experiment involving wolf-type Pet Beasts.\nVice President Liu laughed heartily. \"Just this? Come on, I’ll take you to get the Pet Beasts. Let’s go to my lab!\"\nOld Liu was inwardly excited. This cheeky youngster finally remembered him, a Senior Breeder of Wolf Pets at the Breeder Association! At last, he could be of use.\nAfter a quick word of instruction to Tian Xinghuo, Old Liu, practically buzzing with impatience, was ready to lead Su Ping away, completely ignoring everyone else behind him.\nMeanwhile, Ding Yan, fidgeting beside him, ultimately couldn’t hold back. Under the astonished gazes of all the Junior Breeders from Huaiyang Province, he spoke up,\n\"Uh... Su Ping, do you need any help from me?\"\nSu Ping was taken aback. He turned his head to look at Breeder Ding and, after a moment’s thought, said,",

      "content": "Chapter 212: Chapter 142: He’s Not From the Same World as You!_4\n\"Sure, it’s not a big deal anyway. Brother Ding, you can come too if you want!\"\nIndeed, it wasn’t a big deal. The experiment with the Heart of the Wolf required all other Wolf Pets to give it a try, naturally including the Flame Wolf, along with various Magic Potions and resource combinations for consumption.\nThe more people helping out, the better they could understand any situation that might arise.\nMoreover, Su Ping had another purpose. The effect of the Heart of the Wolf could work on any canine-type Pet Beast.\nWhen the time came to start a company with Dong Muyun, the demand from individual households was one aspect.\nMore importantly, the demand from Breeder Associations everywhere, and Cultivation bases for canine-type Pet Beasts all over—their consumption would be the bulk of it.\nThe more people who knew, the greater the demand would be when the time came—it would be like advertising.\nTherefore, amidst the two men’s excited gazes, Ding Yan didn’t even bother with the other Junior Breeders, who were looking at him helplessly, and followed Su Ping, leaving the Flame Wolf base behind.\nAs for Liu Fuhai, he deliberately lingered at the back. After everyone left, he cast a meaningful glance at Tian Xinghuo, who couldn’t hide his grievance and longing.\nTian Xinghuo wanted to go too!\nHe was also in the ’Jianghai’s Wolf’ group chat and naturally knew exactly what Su Ping had accomplished.\nAfter the Breeder Competition at the end of the year, this guy would be the youngest specialized Senior Breeder in Jianghai Province!\nAnd now, this man seemingly had another new discovery—who the hell didn’t want to be the first to witness it?\nBut as Tian Xinghuo watched Teacher Liu leave, he seemed to have understood something. Once only he and the remaining Breeders from Huaiyang Province were left in the base compartment, he cleared his throat.\n\"Quiet down and continue to familiarize yourselves with the Flame Wolf...\"\nClearly, the scene just before had left everyone baffled.\nAt this, the young man with sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes, who was a leader among them, couldn’t help but ask, \"Um, Teacher Tian, who was that student just now...?\"\nHearing this usually proud youth—who didn’t take other Breeders seriously and always acted superior—address him as ’Teacher,’ Tian Xinghuo smiled slightly, \"Oh, that? Su Ping is an Intermediate Level Breeder from our Jianghai Province Breeders Association. He just graduated last summer, I believe. Ah, young people these days are really more and more impressive...\"\n\"Tsk, there’s no choice but to accept one is getting old...\" Tian Xinghuo said in a reflective, almost indifferent tone.\nJust graduated this year?\nIntermediate Level Breeder?\nThe young man and the other Huaiyang Province Breeders, who fancied themselves as having extraordinary talents, exchanged glances.\n\"Um... Breeder Su, what Pet Beast and Cultivation Skills does he specialize in?\" the young man with sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes asked, a bit unconvinced.\n\"Forest Wolf. As for Cultivation Skills, it’s the Wood Heart Skill. I’ve even heard that Breeder Su’s success rate with cultivating the Wood Heart Skill in Forest Wolves is extremely high; he has almost never failed...\"\nInstantly, the young man clenched his fists, his eyes filled with disbelief.\nAlthough he had dismissed the Forest Wolf as nothing special last time, he knew that there were no weaklings among any of the Elite Peak Pet Beasts.\nHe, and they, had to admit that Su Ping—seemingly younger than most of them—indeed seemed to be more outstanding than all of them.\nHowever, that wasn’t the end of it. Pausing, Tian Xinghuo then continued, \"However, you shouldn’t feel too inferior, because Su Ping is simply not from your world, nor from mine. A few days ago, I heard that Breeder Su independently developed an Advanced Level Evolutionary Body of the Forest Wolf. He will probably go to represent Jianghai Province at the Breeder Competition at the end of the year.\n\"By then, he will be promoted to Senior Breeder. So, don’t compare yourselves to Breeder Su; it’s pointless. Some people are just not from the same world as ordinary folks. Alright, continue with your Cultivation of the Flame Wolf.\"\nThis simple sentence left everyone frozen in place.\nTian Xinghuo, however, didn’t care. Although Teacher Liu had told them not to spread the word widely, Ding Yan was a witness. After going back, he would certainly share the news with Huaiyang Province. For now, revealing this served his purpose, so there was nothing wrong with it.\nBut everyone else was already silent.\nDon’t feel too inferior... not from the same world... comparing with him is pointless...\nUsually, others used these words to describe them, but now, these words were used to compare them to another peer.\nThey found themselves at a loss for words.\nBecause if what he said was true, perhaps that person really wasn’t from the same world as them?\nHowever, before long, Tian Xinghuo once again spoke in a bland tone, \"Of course, being with outstanding Beast Tamers and Breeders can make you more outstanding. Huaiyang Province is good, but I’m afraid it lacks geniuses like Su Ping, right?\n\"If you have time, Su Ping might occasionally come to give a lecture and share his Cultivation insights. Of course, that privilege is reserved only for Breeders affiliated with the Jianghai Province Breeders Association.\n\"Over here in Jianghai, we’re also recruiting some talented Breeders. If you’re considering transferring to the Jianghai Association, there are benefits waiting for you...\"\nTian Xinghuo looked at these young Breeders, who were deep in thought, finally revealing his intention.\nPoaching? What’s the big deal? Everyone does it!",

      "content": "Chapter 213: Chapter 143: The Best Supplement! The Effect of Heart of the Wolf!\nThe departing Ding Yan was clearly unaware that the new Breeders in Huaiyang Province were undergoing a ’life and death’ trial.\nHe had enthusiastically followed Su Ping into the laboratory.\nThere, he heard about the results of Su Ping’s latest experiment.\n\"This time, it’s to test the effects of a new Magic Potion I’ve developed over the past two days. It’s called Heart of the Wolf, and it’s primarily designed to help wolf-type Pet Beasts digest Magic Potions and absorb resources more effectively. It’s a special kind of adjunct potion. However, its exact effects still need to be tested, so all of our Association’s wolf pets might be used for the trial. Also, do you have any other Magic Potions or resources that show effects shortly after absorption? I can pay for the experiment, and if there’s any loss...\"\nSu Ping hadn’t finished speaking when Ding Yan eagerly interrupted, \"What’s a little expense? If the Jianghai Breeder Association won’t cover it, our Huaiyang Breeder Association will...\"\nOld Liu shot the man a disdainful look. That bastard truly never missed an opportunity to poach talent.\nOld Liu waved his hand dismissively. \"The Jianghai Breeder Association really isn’t short on this kind of expenditure. Xiao Sun, go notify all the major canine bases to send two experimental subjects each to Laboratory 002, along with the corresponding Magic Potions and resources.\"\nSun Chaoju nodded, took out his mobile phone, and walked out. He returned shortly after. \"Teacher,\" he reported, \"they will be delivered in three minutes. However, the Shadow Wolf base has no spare Pet Beasts at the moment. Mu Hang borrowed them for his breeding base and hasn’t returned them yet.\"\nMu Hang was the Shadow Wolf specialty Breeder who had been with Sun Chaoju when Su Ping first attended Liu Fuhai’s class.\nMissing one wasn’t a huge deal.\nHowever, Ding Yan clicked his tongue, and Liu Fuhai’s expression soured. \"What’s going on here?\" he asked. \"Where is Mu Hang? What if this adjunct Magic Potion happens to conflict with the Shadow Wolves?\"\nSun Chaoju scratched his head helplessly and replied, \"Teacher, Mu Hang has been a bit busy lately and made a quick trip to Magic Capital. I’ll call him in a bit, though, and have the people from his breeding base return the Shadow Wolves.\"\nSu Ping also hurriedly waved his hand. \"It’s no big deal, one less won’t hurt.\"\nOld Liu’s expression softened slightly. With nothing else to do, he followed up on the conversation, \"What did he go to Magic Capital for?\"\nSun Chaoju glanced at Ding Yan beside him, but this action only irritated Liu Fuhai more. \"Spit it out!\" he snapped. \"That little rascal is thick as thieves with you. If you don’t tell me, who else can I ask?\"\nOnly then did Sun Chaoju speak softly, \"Teacher, his father has returned. He’s in Magic Capital!\"\nAt these words, Liu Fuhai’s expression subtly changed. The previous indifference wavered slightly, but he simply nodded and said no more.\nSu Ping, watching this, became interested.\nCould this Breeder Mu Hang have an even more profound background?\nHowever, he didn’t press further, noticing from Old Liu’s expression that he didn’t want to discuss the matter extensively.\nInstead, Ding Yan, who was standing nearby, suddenly smiled faintly and remarked, \"Is that the renowned Senior Undead Breeder Mu Yu from over thirty years ago? I heard that due to some incidents, he was sentenced to three years in prison. After his release, he changed his nationality to the Eagle Country. I’m surprised he’s back in the Dragon Nation...\"\nAs soon as these words were spoken, a ripple of emotion flickered in Liu Fuhai’s eyes, as if this name held great significance for him.\nHowever, the name had an even greater impact on Su Ping; he was momentarily stunned upon hearing it.\nIt was far too familiar to him.\nIt belonged to none other than the author of the Paperman Breeding Journal that Sun Chaoju had given him—the Senior Undead Breeder who started with full confidence, then eventually lost his composure in a fit of anger, leaving behind evaluations like \"disgrace to the Necromancy System\" and \"a trash, defective Pet Beast that shouldn’t even be considered part of the Necromancy System.\"\nSo this Breeder was still alive? Judging by that journal, Su Ping had been quite certain he had passed away long ago!\nHe hadn’t expected that Mu Yu was not only still alive but also Mu Hang’s father.\nOn reflection, it made sense. Su Ping hadn’t made the connection before, but the surname Mu wasn’t very common. Since they both came from the Jianghai Province Breeders Association, it was indeed highly probable for Breeders with the same surname to be related.\nHowever, compared to the ever-smiling Mu Hang, Su Ping didn’t hold that Senior Undead Breeder in high regard.\nIn fact, he felt a strong aversion.\nTo experiment with Paperman evolution, Mu Yu had even gone as far as conducting soul-devouring experiments.\nSuch experiments not only violated morals but also the laws of the Dragon Nation.\nHe’s in Magic Capital? And he joined the Eagle Country?\nA thought crossed Su Ping’s mind, but he still did nothing.\nClearly, no one wanted to continue the topic after Ding Yan brought it up, so Ding Yan said no more. Just as the atmosphere became slightly awkward, the Breeder Association staff acted quickly.\nTwo Snow Wolves and two Sand Wolves were the first to be delivered.\nAlong with these Pet Beasts came two bottles of Magic Potion and two special resources.\nThe resources were Ice System hexagonal snowflake crystals.\nThe two bottles of Magic Potion were relatively common strength-burst Magic Potions.",

The Effect of Heart of the Wolf!_2\nAfter consumption, it would increase a Pet Beast’s energy burst power for a certain period.\nThe hexagonal snowflake crystal was an Elite Level Ice System resource. When consumed by a Snow Wolf, it would partially transform the snowflakes in its ’Wind Snow Homecoming’ skill into hexagonal ones, thereby enhancing the skill’s power.\nEveryone snapped back to reality. Su Ping then retrieved the box containing the Heart of the Wolf potion from his Beast Taming Space.\nHe took out two prepared vials of the Heart of the Wolf Magic Potion.\nHe then went directly to the testing ground.\nThe preliminary test was very simple.\nVice President Liu brought the Snow Wolf and the Sand Wolf to the laboratory’s energy impact test post.\nUnder his command, a howling sandstorm from the Sand Wolf struck the test post.\nA line of text soon appeared on the screen behind the test post.\n[Wind, Earth Element skill attack, assessing skill as: Sand Assault (Sand Wolf), Pet Beast’s own Level: Elite Sixth Rank, estimated Skill Level as: Proficient Level, skill attack power intensity: 94]\n[Wind, Earth Element skill attack, assessing skill as: Sand Assault (Sand Wolf), Pet Beast’s own Level: Elite Seventh Rank, estimated Skill Level as: Proficient Level, skill attack power intensity: 101]\nWhy don’t I have this thing?\nSu Ping blinked.\nThis device is quite convenient!\nThe attacks from the two Sand Wolves were almost identical in power. Next, without Su Ping needing to say more, Vice President Liu, who had already devised a testing method, gave Su Ping a meaningful glance.\nSu Ping passed a vial of the Heart of the Wolf potion to the Elite Sixth Rank Sand Wolf and had it consume it.\nAWOOO~\nAn extremely excited howl came from the mouth of the Elite Sixth Rank Sand Wolf.\nVisibly, in less than a minute, the Sand Wolf’s powerful digestive ability allowed it to completely assimilate the Heart of the Wolf potion.\nOld Liu had already administered the two prepared vials of Energy Burst Potion to both Sand Wolves.\nBOOM!\nUnder the enhancement of the Energy Burst Potion, the auras of the two Elite Sand Wolves became terrifying.\nEspecially the Elite Sixth Rank Forest Wolf, which had consumed the Heart of the Wolf Magic Potion; its eyes even began to turn red.\nIt began to pace back and forth, excited and even agitated.\nFortunately, Old Liu’s spiritual power kept it restrained, so nothing untoward occurred.\nMeanwhile, at his command, the two Sand Wolves launched their attacks at the test post again!\n[Wind, Earth Element skill attack, assessing skill as: Sand Assault (Sand Wolf), Pet Beast’s own Level: Elite Sixth Rank, estimated Skill Level as: Proficient Level, skill attack power intensity: 141]\n[Wind, Earth Element skill attack, assessing skill as: Sand Assault (Sand Wolf), Pet Beast’s own Level: Elite Seventh Rank, estimated Skill Level as: Proficient Level, skill attack power intensity: 133]\nThe data feedback displayed on the screen once more left everyone present slightly stunned.\nAfter consuming the Energy Burst Potion, it was clear that the skill power of the two Sand Wolves had increased explosively.\nNormally, this Low-level Energy Burst Potion would increase power by approximately thirty percent.\nWithout a doubt, the power unleashed by the Elite Seventh Rank Sand Wolf was correct.\nHowever, the power of the Sand Assault from the Elite Sixth Rank Sand Wolf seemed off!\nConsidering its previous power was only 94, even accounting for data fluctuations, this increase was a bit too much.\nA single Energy Burst Potion had actually increased its power by a full forty percent! Compared to a normal Energy Burst Potion, this was an additional ten percent increase in power, meaning the Heart of the Wolf enhanced the potion’s effect by over thirty percent!?\nThe increase might not seem that large, especially considering the Heart of the Wolf could be even more expensive than an Energy Burst Potion.\nHowever, it was important to remember this was merely a straightforward, observable test.\nNormally, no one would be foolish enough to use the absorption-enhancing effect of the Heart of the Wolf Magic Potion on a mere Energy Burst Potion.\nThe latter was just a Low-level potion with a temporary effect.\nBut what if it were applied to Magic Potions for Cultivation Skills, increasing Realms, accelerating growth, or even those that help a Pet Beast achieve Evolution?\nWith the Heart of the Wolf as an auxiliary potion, wouldn’t it be equivalent to adding an extra half-dose effect to any Magic Potion consumed?\nWhat did this imply? The answer was self-evident.\nVice President Liu blinked, suppressing the turbulent emotions in his heart. He hurriedly commanded the excited Sand Wolf to attack again. Multiple tests were needed to truly ascertain the effect.\nAnd sure enough, the effect became clear:\n[141, 142, 144...]\n\"How is its power still increasing?\" Sun Chaoju complained from the side. Su Ping and Vice President Liu, however, understood.\nThis was a natural increase occurring as time passed, with the potion still in its absorption phase.\nOnce the potion’s effects fully manifested and then began to wane, the power level would naturally decrease again.\nNevertheless, the effectiveness of the Heart of the Wolf was undeniably confirmed on the Sand Wolf—and it was a significant confirmation at that!\nThis time, no instructions were needed. The trial of the Magic Potion continued, and next, it was undoubtedly the Snow Wolf’s turn.\nThe steps were the same, the process was the same, and ultimately, the results were the same.\nIn fact, the results were even more astounding than those from the Sand Wolf moments before.\nConsuming the hexagonal snowflake was fundamentally intended to enhance the power of the Snow Wolf’s ’Wind Snow Homecoming’ skill.",

      "content": "Chapter 215: Chapter 143: The Best Supplement! The Effect of Heart of the Wolf!_3\nBut in reality, a true qualitative change couldn’t be produced. This ’qualitative change’ referred to a Mutation of Skills, like enhancements, observable under the Eye of Truth. Instead, it merely increased the power of the snowflakes in Wind Snow Homecoming, turning them into so-called hexagonal snowflakes. This increase could also be observed on the Energy power testing stakes.\nHowever, testing was ultimately almost unnecessary. This was because the Snow Wolves that had consumed Heart of the Wolf, when compared to those that hadn’t, not only advanced one Level themselves after using the hexagonal snowflakes, but the Skill Level of their Wind Snow Homecoming also increased by one Level. From its previous Proficiency, it had impressively advanced to the Proficient level.\nPerhaps this particular Snow Wolf possessed better innate Talent than the other. Regardless, the effects of the Heart of the Wolf were undeniably demonstrated from another angle. That was enough.\nNext, Hunting Wolves, Flame Wolves, and even Forest Wolves were brought in.\nHowever, with each attempted experiment on a Wolf Pet, the gleam in the eyes of the few people present grew brighter.\nIt works! It all works!\nThese three relatively common types of wolves, after using the Heart of the Wolf, all showed a significant increase in their absorption of resources and Magic Potions. Although this effect lasted for only a brief ten minutes, that was sufficient. After all, the preciousness of such effects and Abilities was not determined by their duration!\nThe three onlookers’ gazes towards Su Ping were peculiar, yet intensely fervent.\nWhy did this kid manage to create such a huge stir in such a short time?\nAs Breeders of Forest Wolves and Wolf Pets, they truly understood the significance of the Heart of the Wolf.\nIt meant that with this item, the Cultivation of many Wolf Pets would become relatively simple! There would be no need to consider absorption efficiency or tolerance when using various resources and Magic Potions. Furthermore, resources and Magic Potions could unleash effects far exceeding their inherent potential. This was simply an indispensable supplement for any Wolf Pet Breeder! It even held considerable significance for enhancing the strength of wolf-type Pet Beasts!\nNevertheless, the three suppressed their excitement, because next to be tested were Thunder Wolves, Moon Wolves, and even Evolutionary Bodies like Fear Wolves and Desert Wind Wolves. Not only that, but other canine Pet Beasts like Gigantic Howlers and Magma Hounds were also included in the trials.\nAlthough there were some fluctuations in the effects, according to the tests conducted by the three, the impact on Fire Element and Thunder Element types was generally moderate. However, other canine Pet Beast types, such as Wood Element, Earth Element, Water Element, Ice System, and Wind System, showed considerable improvements.\nFurthermore, Su Ping observed that although a period of physical and mental exhaustion followed after the initial excitement from consumption wore off, there were no instances of a reduced Realm. Clearly, the Heart of the Wolf, which he had spent many days developing, had perfectly resolved all such potential drawbacks. It had become a supplementary Magic Potion truly suitable for widespread use by the populace!\nThe testing continued from morning until dusk, and most canine types were proven to experience exceptionally remarkable improvement effects. Then, before Su Ping could even speak, Ding Yan, one of the impatient trio, eagerly asked, \"Su Ping, when can the ’Heart of the Wolf’ be mass-produced? What will its price be? The Huaiyang Province Breeder Association can preorder five thousand vials every month...\"\n\"Su Ping, my Wolf Den’s volume is smaller, but I’ll also need about one hundred vials each month...\"\n\"Xiao Ping, we have quite a few Wolf Pets in Jianghai, and the demand for the Heart of the Wolf is also very urgent...\"\nAlthough I had anticipated that business would be good once the effects of the Heart of the Wolf were demonstrated, I didn’t expect it to be *this* good! How has this sideline research project seemingly turned into a goose that lays golden eggs?",

Company Established!\n\"Dong Muyun, where have the Hydro Barriers for the Crescent Lake project gone?\"\nAt dusk, in the offices of Tianyun Group, Dong Mutian questioned furiously.\nDong Muyun simply glanced at him indifferently.\n\"The sale of Hydro Barriers is handled by Tianyun Materials, a company within Tianyun Group, and it’s unrelated to the real estate subsidiary. Naturally, if the Crescent Lake project wants to use them, the real estate company needs to make an offer and purchase them from Tianyun Materials!\"\n\"But...\"\nDong Mutian was seething. Before he took over, were things ever this complicated? They were all part of the same group. What did it matter if some material fees were owed?\nThe real estate company’s profits were relatively slow, unlike the rapid and lucrative income from selling Pet Beasts, resources, and materials, but it was a long-term business. In such cases, it was only reasonable for the other subsidiaries to offer some support.\nHowever, after he took charge, things had clearly become more complicated.\nSubsidiaries of the same group, having to pay first before getting the goods?\nEven working with external companies wasn’t this stringent, was it?\nYet, it was clear Dong Mutian had no alternative. He quickly sat down and said softly, \"Xiao Yun, why bother? This is all for the family...\"\nBefore he could finish his sentence, Dong Muyun’s phone suddenly rang.\nDong Muyun had no inclination to bicker with him. She glanced at her phone, and her eyes lit up.\nShe didn’t hurry to answer but looked at Dong Mutian.\n\"I have some matters to attend to. If you have nothing else, I won’t keep you.\"\nWith that, she picked up her phone and walked into the inner office.\n\"Hello? Su Ping!\"\nWatching Dong Muyun’s retreating figure, a dark look flashed in Dong Mutian’s eyes, yet he felt helpless.\nHe could only leave in frustration, but just before he did, his brow furrowed slightly.\nSu Ping? Who is that?\nDong Muyun paid no mind to her elder brother’s thoughts. Listening to the voice on the other end of the phone, Queen Dong, who had worn a frosty expression for days, broke into a smile as radiant as a blooming flower.\n\"Good, good, I’ll be right there. Just wait for me.\"\n「At the entrance of the Breeder Association building.」\nSu Ping stood with Sun Chaoju.\n\"Are you sure you don’t want your brother to take you?\" Sun Chaoju asked.\n\"I’m sure. You should get back to your business. I’ve arranged for someone to pick me up!\" Su Ping replied with a smile, declining Sun Chaoju’s enthusiastic offer.\nHowever, Sun Chaoju wasn’t foolish enough to leave immediately; he could afford to wait a little longer.\n\"I’ll keep you company for a bit. I really can’t figure out how your mind works. This Heart of the Wolf, if it could be mass-produced, would probably be even more lucrative than the Wanmu Wolf’s cultivation and evolution!\"\nSun Chaoju opened his mouth, actually wanting to suggest further cooperation with Su Ping.\nUnfortunately, he knew his own limitations. To quickly popularize the Heart of the Wolf Magic Potion, distribution channels weren’t the main issue; the most critical factor was production capacity.\nAmong Pet Beasts, beast-type Pet Beasts had the largest and broadest appeal. While wolf-and-dog-type Pet Beasts might not be the most used among beast-types, they would undoubtedly rank among the top three—not just in third place.\nOne could only imagine how vast the market for the Heart of the Wolf was.\nSu Ping wasn’t paying much attention to these matters. While waiting, he finally voiced the question that had been lingering in his mind all day.\n\"Brother Sun, Mu Hang’s father—is he the owner of that Undead Breeder’s diary you gave me last time?\"\nSun Chaoju nodded. \"Yes, that’s Senior Undead Breeder Mu Yu! I didn’t expect that after so many years, he would return from across the ocean.\"\n\"So he’s still alive. I thought...\" Su Ping mused.\nSun Chaoju glanced at Su Ping and then said in a lower voice, \"The affairs of Breeder Mu Yu were somewhat taboo in the early years. He was said to be a friend of Teacher Liu, but... as you might have seen in that diary, Mu Yu used cultivation methods that were not permitted by law and was eventually discovered, arrested, and imprisoned. After his release, he contacted some spies from across the ocean and chose to leave our Dragon Nation, joining a place where Pet Beast cultivation is more ’free.’ It’s a wonder what he’s come back for this time.\"\nSu Ping nodded. \"That Mu Hang...\"\n\"Mu Hang himself doesn’t really like Undead-type Pet Beast cultivation; he’s starkly different from his father. That, I can assure you,\" Sun Chaoju stated firmly.\nIt was clear he trusted his friend considerably.\n\"By the way, didn’t you say last time that you wanted to research that Paperman? How’s that coming along?\"\nClearly, Sun Chaoju didn’t want to dwell on the previous topic.\nSu Ping scratched his head. \"There’s been a bit of progress!\"\nSun Chaoju pursed his lips, then looked at Su Ping quizzically. \"Su Ping, tell me the truth. Have you already evolved the Paperman?\"\nSu Ping was startled. Before he could speak, Sun Chaoju continued, \"Last time, when you mentioned the Wanmu Wolf, you also said there was ’a bit of progress.’ Is your definition of ’a bit of progress’ different from my understanding of it?\"\nSu Ping smiled helplessly. \"This time, it really is just a bit of progress.\"\nIt was indeed just a bit of progress: he had merely researched another Racial Skill of the Paperman, one that almost no one had discovered. And, following this direction, the probability of achieving its evolution was extremely high.",

Company Established!_2\nBut after all, it hasn’t evolved, has it?\nSun Chaoju didn’t think too much and nodded in agreement.\nIt makes sense. Su Ping has been busy with the Legion’s affairs recently. The Paperman must really be just a whim of this brat... right?\nStanding at the entrance of the Breeder Association’s compound, finally, after more than ten minutes, a red sports car slowly approached from a distance.\nSu Ping’s gaze was fixed on the vehicle.\nThe mechanical sleekness was indeed impressive, and combined with the red color, it exuded an indescribable sense of wildness.\nHowever, to his surprise, the car stopped not far away, executed an elegant turn at the intersection, and pulled up in front of Su Ping. Dong Muyun, wearing sunglasses, lowered them slightly. Her charming eyes lifted as she looked toward Su Ping, who was squatting by the roadside.\n\"Get in!\"\n\"Alright!\"\nSu Ping ignored Sun Chaoju’s strange expression beside him and excitedly got into the car.\nDamn it! No wonder he didn’t want me to give him a ride. So this was the sweet deal he had lined up? Good heavens, a mechanical intelligent supercar? Could this kid Su Ping actually be a kept man?\nSun Chaoju shook his head, but his brow furrowed slightly.\nThat woman in sunglasses—why did her eyes look so familiar when she revealed them?\n「...」\n\"Got a new car?\"\nSu Ping looked at the red mechanical sports car. \"Is it made by Mechanical Core?\"\n\"Hmph.\"\nDong Muyun didn’t answer, just hummed lightly.\n\"Do you guys at Tianyun make these things too? I should get one someday!\" Su Ping said with admiration.\nThat old fellow Su Anyong’s Super Shadow still lingered in Su Ping’s memory.\nBut Dong Muyun didn’t dwell on this and quickly asked, \"We’ll talk about that later. How’s the Heart of the Wolf coming along?\"\nSu Ping directly pulled out a small document bag from his chest.\nDong Muyun softly instructed, \"Red King, enter intelligent driving mode. Destination: Heart of Wood Cultivation Base in Linzhou City!\"\nOnly then did she hurriedly take the document bag.\nInside the bag were the certification documents issued by the Breeder Association today.\nThe content of the certificate was very straightforward.\n[After testing and verification by the Jianghai Province Breeders Association, the ’Heart of the Wolf’ Magic Potion auxiliary formula has shown a significant enhancement in resource absorption for wolf-type Pet Beasts, with effects ranging from 20% to 40%! No special adverse reactions have surfaced. Thus, it is certified for market production!]\nIn addition to this official document endorsed by the Breeder Association, there was another similar file.\n[Patent application for the ’Heart of the Wolf’ Magic Potion formula. This formula is held by ’Su Ping.’ Any use requires authorization from ’Mr. Su Ping.’ Violators will be prosecuted under Dragon Nation law...]\nTwo certificates: one, an official document backed by the Breeder Association; the other, the patent for the Heart of the Wolf. All settled.\nFrom now on, the Heart of the Wolf could be openly launched on the market. Advertisements could be run, and all users would be free to try it.\nHowever, upon seeing these items, Dong Muyun was completely stunned. She frowned and said, \"Su Ping, I know you have a good relationship with the Breeder Association, but certificates like this aren’t issued so lightly. The effects of Magic Potions can’t be exaggerated; otherwise...\"\nClearly, a 20% to 40% absorption enhancement was preposterous.\nDong Muyun’s first thought was that Vice President Liu, who had a good relationship with Su Ping within the Breeder Association, had intervened and exaggerated the medicinal effects.\nHowever, before she could finish, she saw Su Ping’s calm gaze.\nDong Muyun swallowed her words and looked at Su Ping with a puzzled expression. \"Is this for real?\"\n\"Of course! The potency varies according to the respective Pet Beast’s Attribute. The effect is slightly lower for Pet Beasts with Thunder and Fire Attributes. Additionally, while the effect for Commander Level Pet Beasts and above is relatively lower, the enhancement still remains at a minimum of around 20%... However, I haven’t tried it on Monarch and Emperor Level Pet Beasts yet; I estimate the effect might decrease further. If possible, you can give it a try when you have the means.\"\nDong Muyun blinked and then sharply asked the next question, \"What’s the cost of this Heart of the Wolf?\"\nSu Ping did some quick calculations in his mind.\nWolf Tobacco is practically free, and even purchasing it in large quantities wouldn’t be very expensive. However, the other resources required to be blended with the Heart of the Wolf—to balance its potent nature and prevent any decrease in the Wolf Pets’ Realms—do incur some costs. For instance, Grass Sap and Hollow Bamboo.\nSu Ping thought for a moment and said, \"The cost of one bottle is probably around thirty thousand.\"\nIn the Heart of Woods’ Magic Potions, the most expensive ingredient is the Honey Extract Bee’s stinger. The rest of the resources themselves aren’t that pricey. All things considered, a cost of about thirty thousand is relatively reasonable.\n\"Thirty thousand...\" Dong Muyun’s eyes began to sparkle.\nThirty thousand...\nDong Muyun was already calculating. For such an effective auxiliary Magic Potion, people would willingly pay three hundred thousand, perhaps even one million three hundred thousand! However, there’s a difference between individual retail purchases and wholesale production; pricing strategy is crucial. The pricing must guarantee substantial profits while also ensuring it’s affordable for the average Beast Tamer!

      "content": "Chapter 218: Chapter 144: Su Ping is Kept? Company Established!_3\nSu Ping was dumbfounded. He looked at Dong Muyun, who was flushed with excitement, a mix of indignation and exasperation filling him.\n\"What are you doing?!\"\nDong Muyun looked at Su Ping, who resembled a bashful bride, and let out a hearty laugh. \"Why so shy, huh? Miss Qin isn’t here right now...\"\n\"Pah! What does she have to do with this?\"\nSu Ping wiped the lipstick marks and saliva from his face with a look of disgust.\nDong Muyun didn’t seem to mind. She looked at Su Ping with sparkling eyes. \"When shall we establish the company? Tell me, how much of the shares do you want?\"\nSeeing the excited Dong Muyun, Su Ping had reason to suspect this woman had been waiting here for him.\n\"You tell me,\" Su Ping said.\n\"Fifty percent, how about that? You provide the formula, and I’ll handle the initial investment, production, distribution channels, product stocking, raw materials, labor, premises, and all other issues!\"\nIt had to be said, Dong Muyun wasn’t really being greedy. Fifty percent was just for Su Ping’s name and the Heart of the Wolf formula. However, with only the formula, he wouldn’t need to worry about any other aspects.\nFrom a certain perspective, this was indeed a reliable offer. With such an arrangement, Su Ping could continue being a hands-off boss.\nBut...\nSu Ping pondered for a moment before saying, \"I want sixty percent!\"\nSeeing Dong Muyun slightly furrow her brow, as if about to speak, Su Ping added, \"You don’t need to say anything; I know what your concerns are. However, with your forty percent stake, you will still have full administrative control over the company, effectively wielding the managerial authority of all shares, including my sixty percent. The only difference is that you won’t receive dividends from my portion. Also, if I conduct further research and develop something marketable, the company will also handle its production.\n\"I won’t ask for additional equity then! Besides, with my influence, securing large orders from the Beast Master Association and the Breeder Association won’t require too much effort on your part!\"\nHearing this, Dong Muyun pondered for a moment, then said with a sigh of resignation, \"With the effectiveness of Heart of the Wolf, there’s really no concern about sales channels...\"\n\"Exactly,\" Su Ping cut in. \"So, there’s no need to emphasize your contributions in that area. Besides, even if sales channels aren’t a concern, can you secure orders from the Legion?\"\nAt this, Dong Muyun’s eyes lit up again. She stared intently at Su Ping. \"You have a way to sell Heart of the Wolf to the Legion?\"\nThe Legion! They’re the real big spenders! Dong Muyun knew this better than anyone. Even if it meant slightly less profit per unit, the Legion lacked nothing: not material resources, not Pet Beasts, and certainly not special privileges. Establishing a partnership with the Legion would mean their fledgling company could firmly establish its footing in Jianghai, and even across the entire Dragon Nation! But this was incredibly difficult. She knew this all too well from past experiences. The Legion rarely collaborated with external organizations. Pet Beast breeding, resource allocation—the Legion had its own mature, self-contained system for all of it. It was incredibly difficult for outsiders to get involved. If Su Ping actually had such connections, then things would be different.\nIn truth, Su Ping wasn’t one hundred percent certain either. However, from recent events, he had gleaned some understanding of the situation. The Legion’s cultivation system was isolated from the outside world and entirely self-contained. This internal isolation had unfortunately led to severe corruption. Consequently, Dragon Nation had initiated reforms within the Legion, including outsourcing a portion of its cultivation needs. The recent Legion tournament was a direct result of these reforms.\nNow, given the effectiveness of his Heart of the Wolf, there was no reason for the Legion to refuse, was there? After all, his relationship with Chief Lin of the War Wolf Alpha Division was still quite decent.\n\"I can’t guarantee it one hundred percent, but I’m reasonably confident. Is that acceptable?\" Su Ping asked.\nForty percent of the shares... And she would still retain full administrative autonomy.\nDong Muyun nodded.\nSu Ping’s promises: cooperation with the various Breeder and Beast Master Associations, a partnership with the Legion... And on top of that, his commitment regarding future inventions. Thinking it over, Dong Muyun suddenly realized that perhaps the most valuable condition of all was Su Ping’s commitment not to demand additional equity for any new research or inventions he developed that the company subsequently commercialized. That might just be the most crucial part. After all, how old was Su Ping really? To have achieved such a high standard of cultivation and made such astonishing discoveries at his young age... Who could possibly predict what he’d achieve in the future?\n\"Accepted! Completely accepted!\" Dong Muyun immediately slung an arm around Su Ping’s shoulder and whispered in his ear, \"So, my dearest partner, how would you like me to thank you?\"\nSu Ping paid no attention to the woman whispering seductively beside his ear. He ran a hand over the car’s blood-red metallic interior and said, \"Didn’t I mention it earlier? Just get me one of these big toys. It’ll save you the trouble of always having to pick me up.\"\nDong Muyun’s expression stiffened.\nIs my charm really less appealing than this cold, lifeless hunk of metal?\nInstantly, all her earlier excitement vanished. She glared at Su Ping. \"What kind would you like?\"\n\"Black. Black looks cool! But not solid black, of course...\"\nSu Ping didn’t mind Dong Muyun rolling her eyes at him. He recalled Su Anyong’s teachings:\nWhen negotiating an exchange of benefits with a woman, the greatest pitfall is allowing other feelings to interfere. Once a relationship takes a romantic turn, complications invariably arise. Smart women will leverage such a development to demand greater concessions. Therefore, at times like these, one must not be swayed. Even if one were to be swayed, they should choose a foolish, lovesick type. Of course, the same principle applies in reverse.",

You don’t need to ask me about something like this. You should be able to find people with significant market expertise who can determine its maximum possible price.\"\nSu Ping waved his hand dismissively.\n\"You really are ready to be a hands-off manager, huh?\"\nA helpless expression crossed Dong Muyun’s face, but inwardly, she felt a touch of joy. \"What’s our company’s name going to be?\" she asked.\n\"You decide!\"\n\"Hmm... let’s call it Pingyun Company!\"\nSu Ping looked at Dong Muyun skeptically.\nCould it be that this woman didn’t get a perfect score in Chinese on her college entrance exam? Or is this just how company names are decided?\nDong Muyun said confidently, \"What’s wrong with the name? Pingyun suggests ’rising high into the clouds with ease,’ and it’s also a combination of the founders’ names—how great is that?\"\nActually, now that I think about it, that does make sense,\nSu Ping mused. So, he simply nodded, not wanting to bother with it further.\nAfter dropping Su Ping off at his front door, Dong Muyun didn’t even come in for a visit, leaving immediately, full of drive and determination.\nThis woman said that within a few days, she would sort out the company registration, premises, and supply issues, and then get the factory running at full speed.\nClearly, for Dong Muyun, this was her own true venture, holding a completely different significance than her involvement with the Dong Family’s business.\nSu Ping could understand Dong Muyun and was quite satisfied with her. This woman had talent, ability, and connections. He, on the other hand, possessed the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas. In the future, there would likely be many discoveries resulting from it. The Heart of the Wolf was merely an unexpected bonus from perfecting the Heart of Woods Magic Potion and discovering the special properties of Wolf Tobacco, to say nothing of future possibilities.\nHe definitely didn’t have the time or inclination to manage it himself, nor was he cut out for it.\nProfessional matters should be left to professionals.\nThinking of this, Su Ping subconsciously wiped his face again.\nDamn it, that woman’s mouth is just too forward. I’ll need to be on guard in the future.\nWith that thought, Su Ping returned to the Heart of Woods.\nHowever, it was clear that neither the departing Dong Muyun nor Su Ping, who reluctantly entered the Heart of Woods facility, noticed that on the road not far away, a tiny mechanical electronic eye, disguised as a large-winged dragonfly, was observing the scene that had just unfolded. It clearly projected the image of Su Ping getting out of Dong Muyun’s car and Dong Muyun’s departing figure onto a screen.\n「At this moment, in the Linzhou City Center.」\nInside Dong Mutian’s office at Tianyun Group, Dong Mutian was squinting as he watched the scene unfold on a screen before him. He had sensed something was off about Dong Muyun earlier.\nSu Ping? That’s obviously a man’s name. What kind of man could make my sister look like that?\nA smile crept across Dong Mutian’s lips.\nSo that was it,\nhe mused.\nLately, there seemed to be some discrepancies at Tianyun Group. And Yuntian Resort... after investing so much, she just gave it up?\nAlthough Dong Muyun considered him a good-for-nothing, even a good-for-nothing like Dong Mutian could review the accounts after taking over Tianyun Properties. Back then, Dong Mutian had always assumed his sister had some kind of plan or strategy in mind. After all, when it came to business talent, Dong Mutian actually quite admired his half-sister.\nBut now, it seems things aren’t as I thought, huh? So that’s what it is! Wonders never cease! Dong Muyun, oh Dong Muyun, so even you have days when you’re thinking about men? And you’ve even started keeping a toyboy?!\nWith this thought, Dong Mutian felt as if his opportunity had suddenly arrived.\nHis eyes sparkled with excitement and ambition.\nHe then took out his phone and dialed a number.\n\"Hello, Dad...\"",

      "content": "Chapter 220: Chapter 145: Ribbon-Cutting Invitation, Su Ping’s Connections?\n\"What? Your sister is very close to a young guy?\"\nThe man’s voice on the other end of the phone showed shock for the first time.\nBut it quickly returned to calm. \"That’s great! If Xiao Yun has that intention and can find a place to belong, that’s good for her too! I sent you to Tianyun to learn management experience from your sister, not to gossip about everything under the sun.\"\n\"Heh, Dad, it seems it’s not about her finding a place to belong. That young guy seems to be kept by my sister! And she treats him really well!\" Dong Mutian hinted meaningfully.\nThe voice from the other end fell silent again, somewhat helplessly. He had seen the sibling rivalry but was powerless to intervene, especially since his elder son had not lived up to expectations. The Dong Family had exerted a lot of effort to keep him in the Legion, but he hadn’t made a name for himself and, worse, had been ousted for a minor infraction. Now, he could understand his daughter’s feelings.\nHowever, the business of the Dong Family was important, so he proceeded to ask, \"What happened?\"\n\"Previously, Dong Muyun, under the name of Tianyun Real Estate Company, leased a large plot of land around that young guy and built a bunch of resort-style combat bases. Then, more than a month ago, she gave it all to the young fellow, free of charge, seemingly not earning a penny from him. Of course, whether she got anything else in exchange, who knows...\nAlso, the other day, she directed a batch of Water Element barriers intended for my real estate project at Crescent Lake from Tianyun Material Company to that same guy. She used the lowest price and even wrote an IOU, essentially getting them for nothing.\"\n\"Dad, isn’t my sister harming the interests of our Dong Family and Tianyun Group by spoiling her little lover?\"\n\"...\"\nThere was silence on the other end of the phone once more, which lasted a long while before he responded, \"It’s normal for your sister to be resentful because of your arrival. Whatever the case, true or false, you shouldn’t pursue these matters any further, and the family won’t either.\nHowever, in the following period, I’ll have Dong San accompany you. If Yun’er keeps acting like this, I’ll have Dong San remind her at the appropriate time.\"\nDong Mutian’s expression brightened. \"Yes!\"\nThe phone call ended, and excitement flashed in Dong Mutian’s eyes. Perfect, with Dong San accompanying him, he could personally observe what his dear sister and that freeloader were up to, which would surely convince their father.\n「...」\nSu Ping felt he was the world’s biggest sucker.\nPerhaps other Breeders and Beast Tamers didn’t realize what two thousand Forest Wolf Catalog Experience represented. It meant that Su Ping needed to spend several hours with each of fifty to sixty Forest Wolves, for a continuous half-month, to accumulate that much. Although he had quite a stockpile of Forest Wolf Catalog Experience, two thousand was still a lot.\nWas it all to be wasted?!\nIndeed, having returned to the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base, Su Ping didn’t idle around.\nHowever, his two main research approaches had hit a bottleneck.\nOld Sha’s Heart of Woods still had quite a way to go to break through from Proficient to Perfection.\nAs for the Papermen, although they had made progress in their Realm upgrades and Skills enhancement, they hadn’t reached the pinnacle of transformation, let alone Evolution.\nIt was hard to make any breakthroughs in these areas in the short term.\nSo, Su Ping turned his attention to the Cultivation of the Forest Wolf (Senlang type) and Elf Wolf!\nAlthough the evolutionary potential of these two might not match that of the Wanmu Wolf, it was still something to do. Cultivating new evolved species would allow me to accumulate more experience in Pet Beast Cultivation,\nhe thought.\nThus, he spent the two thousand Forest Wolf Catalog Experience as if they were water, refining the evolutionary steps for the Forest Wolf (Senlang type) and Elf Wolf.\nAnd then, what did he see?\nThe refinement for the Forest Wolf (Senlang type) had cost eight hundred Forest Wolf Catalog Experience, yet looking at its refined Evolution method, Su Ping couldn’t even spot any difference in the steps at first glance!\n[Forest Wolf: An advanced evolutionary species of the Forest Wolf, with decent Ability and a further extension of the Forest Wolf’s strength. However, it didn’t stand out in any particular aspect, as it was an Evolution through natural growth.]\n[First (Preparation) Stage: Forest Wolf must reach Elite Fifth Rank and be older than 1 year!]\n[Second Stage: Consume an Elite Level Wood Element Energy enhancement resource and, after each Level up, consume a resource of the same type.]\n[Third Stage: After the Forest Wolf reaches Elite Tenth Tier, consume a Commander Level Wood Element resource to begin Evolution.]\nThat was it.\nThat was the Evolution process for the Forest Wolf (Senlang type).\nIt was ridiculously simple.\nCompared to the complicated and intricate Wanmu Wolf, this Forest Wolf’s Evolution was straightforward, to say the least.\nHowever, Su Ping’s eight hundred Forest Wolf Catalog Experience only served to add one detail to this Forest Wolf’s Evolution, within its second stage: ’Each Level breakthrough interval must be less than a month; other resources are also applicable for accelerating Level advancement.’\nAnd that was it.\nWho wouldn’t know that a shorter Evolution time is better?!\nBut when compared, the Wanmu Wolf indeed offered better value than this Forest Wolf.\nIt was just that evolving a Forest Wolf (the base Linlang type) with better Talent [e.g., into a Wanmu Wolf] incurred a slightly higher cost compared to evolving it into this Forest Wolf (the Senlang type).\nThe Elf Wolf was slightly better.\n[Elf Wolf: A special Forest Wolf Evolver, with decent evolutionary potential and further mastery over the Life Attribute. It can be preliminarily used on other living beings, a rare Life-healing class Evolution; simultaneously, it has achieved a certain degree of initial Elementalization.]",

      "content": "Chapter 221: Chapter 145: Ribbon-Cutting Invitation, Su Ping’s Connections?_2\n[First (Preparation) Phase: The Forest Wolf’s Level has reached Elite Seventh Rank or above, and its Self-Healing Skill has attained Mastery Level!]\n[Second Phase: The Pet Beast enters a critically injured, near-death state and maintains this state for three days. (Note: This phase is special. It is imperative to ensure the Pet Beast’s safety by constantly monitoring its condition with a Life Detector.)]\n[Third Phase: Ingest the Commander Level resource, ’Fruit of Life,’ combined with its innate Self-Healing Skill to complete recovery, then begin Evolution!]\nThese also constituted a three-phase Evolution requirement.\nThe Evolution requirements for the Elf Wolf were much shorter than those for the Forest Wolf, but the risk and difficulty were not only undiminished but, in fact, considerably higher than those of the Forest Wolf.\nFirst of all, as previously mentioned, the most difficult Skill for the Forest Wolf to enhance is Self-Healing. Enhancing the level of the Self-Healing Skill is much more difficult than Skills like Vine Strangling or Accelerated Growth.\nSecondly, without a doubt, the most challenging phase is the second one. Maintaining a near-death state, from a Cultivation perspective, means blurring the Pet Beast’s concept of its own life, moving beyond the limitations of sustenance through mere flesh and blood.\nAfter Evolving, the Elf Wolf can cause its body to undergo a peculiar semi-Elementalization. Although it still possesses a body of flesh and blood, it is vastly different from ordinary beast-type Pet Beasts. If anything, it’s somewhat similar to the Wanmu Wolf’s Mutation, Wood Body. However, the Wood Body is a wooden incarnation, while the Elf Wolf’s semi-Elementalization allows for partial Elementalization while still maintaining a body of flesh and blood. This enhances their survivability, and although their attack power hasn’t increased significantly, it’s absolutely worlds apart from before Evolution.\nMost important were the photos Su Ping had found online. The Elf Wolf’s level of attractiveness was quite impressive. With an ethereal charm, it was far more appealing than the Forest Wolf, which was merely a Forest Wolf that was larger in size.\nCompared to the 800 Experience Points for Evolving a Forest Wolf, the 1,200 Experience Points for the Elf Wolf might make Su Ping a bit reluctant, but it didn’t feel like such a bad deal after all. This was because the 1,200 Experience Points covered the arduous second phase of the revised Cultivation process!\n[Second Phase: After the Pet Beast enters a critically injured and dying state, use the Necromancy System Elite Resources ’Soul Dust’ and ’Elite Slime Core,’ then allow three days for digestion.]\nYes, the second phase had been modified! It was no longer about maintaining a near-death state for three days but rather a substitution with two Elite Resources.\nThe value of this improvement was open to interpretation. Maintaining a near-death state for three days required constant vigilance and energy expenditure, without a moment’s relaxation. However, with this improvement, the three days of suffering were eliminated. One simply needed to reach this threshold, spend some Money to ingest Soul Dust and the Elite Slime Core, and then wait for natural recovery.\nMost importantly, with the perfected second phase from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, the chance of Evolution was one hundred percent! This was unlike other circumstances where the Evolution chance might be insufficient for the Forest Wolf to Evolve.\nExchanging resources for a guaranteed success rate while simultaneously lowering the Cultivation difficulty was, without a doubt, a win from Su Ping’s perspective.\nIt was a pity; the two thousand Experience Points spent on the Forest Wolf Catalog felt a bit wasted, didn’t they?\nSu Ping shook his head; he wasn’t the type to dwell on gains and losses, and he quickly composed himself.\nIt seemed like only two corresponding formulas had been perfected. But in fact, upon deeper reflection, its significance was considerable. He had no comment on the Forest Wolf; from Su Ping’s point of view, there was no need to generalize from it. However, the improvement for the Elf Wolf was interesting.\nThe Elf Wolf’s evolutionary body form is based on semi-Elementalization; let’s put the Life Attribute aside for now. Focusing on the Cultivation and Evolution process between Elementalization and the evolutionary body.\nAs previously mentioned, the second phase of Evolution is to reduce the Forest Wolf’s dependence on its corporeal flesh. However, a normal Elf Wolf relies on the perception and experience between life and death, while also enhancing the level of its Self-Healing Skill, to, to a certain extent, break free from the nourishment of its flesh-and-blood body. But with the perfected Evolution of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, this step is replaced with resources.\nSo...\nSu Ping tapped his pen lightly on his Cultivation notes.\nCouldn’t I add this special process into the Evolution of some Pet Beasts, allowing other Pet Beasts to form a semi-Elementalized body during their Evolution or during other Evolutions of the Forest Wolf? Or even achieve a complete transition from a flesh-and-blood life form to an Elemental life form?\nOf course, this was just a speculation, and a rather nonsensical one at that.\nNonetheless, Su Ping recorded this thought in his notes.\nEvery experience derivation from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas gave Su Ping some inspiration and new perspectives. But no matter what, to approach it from this angle, Su Ping needed a certain understanding of the Elf Wolf.\nThus, Su Ping recalled the advice previously given by the Legion. If you want to command a group of beasts in battle, it would be best to adopt the military organization, using squad, platoon, company, battalion, and regiment as divisions.\nCompany and regiment, for now, seemed a bit remote. But squads and platoons could be planned to some extent.\nAs the ’Battlefield Medic’ in battle, the Elf Wolf’s existence was also indispensable.\nIf a ’squad’ has ten members, and if the ’squad leader’ is the controlling Wanmu Wolf, then how many ’medics’—Elf Wolves—would be needed?",

      "content": "Chapter 222: Chapter 145: Ribbon-Cutting Invitation, Su Ping’s Connections?_3\nSu Ping pondered for a moment.\nOne or two should be enough, right?\nSu Ping had never thought of cultivating all the Forest Wolves into Wanmu Wolves; the resource consumption was too high and too specific, and there was no need anyway.\nDuring the Legion’s martial competition, he had seen the functionality and effectiveness of the Wanmu Wolf.\nTherefore, he needed other Forest Wolf Evolvers to form a team skilled in attacking, defense, agility, and healing—a complete unit that would be an all-around combat group with no weaknesses.\nIndeed, this was the kind of beast swarm combat Su Ping wanted to command, not like a chaotic Beast Tide crashing around blindly. Such a beast swarm wouldn’t allow a Beast Tamer to play their role effectively.\nOf course, these were just Su Ping’s preliminary thoughts. Whether they would change later on was uncertain.\nIn the following days, Dong Muyun was obviously very busy. Apart from arranging for a contract for the company’s registration to be delivered, which Su Ping signed and fingerprinted, he hadn’t had any other contact with her.\nSu Ping was also busy. He was researching the evolution of the Elf Wolf, preparing the necessary resources, and focusing on cultivating a portion of Forest Wolves suitable for this path. Beyond that, he was overseeing the excavation and connection of the Heart of Water, the construction of bridges over the lake, and the engineering inspection related to the Lingxi River.\nAnd then, one day, Dong Muyun’s call finally came through. \"Su Ping,\" she said, \"the venue, factory, equipment, materials, and recruitment are all ready, and our company is set up too. It’s a suburban factory park not far from your home, rented for temporary use. Are you coming to the ribbon-cutting ceremony tomorrow?\"\nThere was a tone of exhaustion in Dong Muyun’s voice.\nObviously, she had been worn out by the recent workload.\nA company ribbon-cutting?\nSu Ping had not participated in any of the previous activities, but attending this event as a co-founder and shareholder was different.\n\"Sure! What time tomorrow?\"\n\"Nine in the morning. I’ve invited some media for interviews. If you can, call on some of your connections. The more people we invite, the better the publicity. Also, have you sorted out the channels with the Legion?\"\n\"Well... I’ve been a bit busy these past few days...\"\n\"All right, as long as you know. I’m going to get some rest. Seriously, I haven’t had any real rest these past few days.\"\nAfter the call ended, Su Ping shook his head.\nHe hadn’t expected Dong Muyun to act so quickly. Had she really settled everything in such a short time?\nBut that was normal, too; Dong Muyun had spent many years in Linzhou, and her Energy was not to be underestimated.\nHe continued browsing his contacts, quickly locking onto one person.\nIt was none other than Chief Lin of the Forest Wild Army’s War Wolf A Division!\n\"Hello, Chief Lin.\"\n\"Hey, Su Ping, missing me already? Don’t call me Chief Lin; you’re practically family now. If you respect old Lin, just call me Uncle Lin. I’m not much older than your dad. Anything you need?\" Lin Lei’s voice came from the other end of the line.\n\"Haha, Uncle Lin, I know you’re busy, so I’ll cut to the chase. I’ve made some new research discoveries and am preparing to establish a factory for mass production. I was wondering if the Legion might be interested in giving it a try?\"\n\"New discoveries?! What kind?!\" Lin Lei’s voice became markedly more excited.\nIndeed, at that moment, Lin Lei was glad of his past decision to give Su Ping his phone number and warmly embrace him. He had made the right move.\nSu Ping told Chief Lin about the Heart of the Wolf.\nThe latter was briefly silent.\n\"Su Ping, for Wolf Pet groups to have a Breeder like you is a blessing for Beast Tamers like us!\"\nAnd indeed, such praise made Su Ping feel a bit embarrassed, but he still said firmly, \"To restore the glory of Wolf Pets, I am duty-bound!\"\n\"Good! But I can’t decide on this alone. Let me ask General Zhao about it.\"\nThe call ended, but within less than ten minutes, the phone rang again.\n\"General Zhao has agreed, but we can’t do it in large batches. We need to start with a few to test the effects. I hope you understand.\"\n\"Certainly, that’s only appropriate. When will you have time to come down to Linzhou? We can discuss it then!\"\n\"I’m free these days. Hahaha, thanks to you, kid, I’ve had a few glorious days and even got some vacation time.\"\nLin Lei’s voice was extremely excited. Clearly, the events of the martial competition these past few days had left him feeling fantastic.\nSu Ping smiled knowingly. \"Since that’s the case, Uncle Lin, come over tomorrow morning. My new factory is having its ribbon-cutting ceremony, and we can discuss things in person then!\"\n\"Deal! I’ll be at your place in the morning, and don’t forget to feed me, haha...\"\nAfter hanging up, Su Ping continued dialing on his phone. Dong Muyun had said that for tomorrow’s ribbon-cutting, inviting more people would generally be a good thing.\nOf course, he didn’t bother the two chairmen for such a minor event. However, for Breeders like Sun Chaoju and Yang He, with whom he had some camaraderie, asking them to show up and add to the excitement wasn’t a problem.\nAfter all, these people were his ’clients’, weren’t they?",

      "content": "Chapter 223: Chapter 146: Dong Mutian Who Came Knocking!\nThis was a relatively secluded area, with no streets or open shops nearby. However, compared to the wilderness and Lingxi River near Heart of Woods—areas with hardly any signs of civilization—this place was undoubtedly much better. Though secluded, it boasted an extensive land area. The tall walls and the towering buildings within indicated its past.\nBut today, this once-bankrupt large factory park was surrounded by a dense crowd. Vehicles filled the park’s parking lot almost to capacity. Some residents from the nearby Linzhou suburbs couldn’t help but gaze in this direction.\nThe Lingyuan Pharma Factory had gone bankrupt five years ago. However, due to contractual issues, the factory buildings and land remained unsold until a few days ago, when word spread that they had finally been purchased. Over the past few days, large containers had been transported here one after another, and no one knew what significant developments were underway.\nNow, it seemed the time had come to unveil the mystery?\nIn just a few days, the factory buildings and courtyard had been completely renovated. Moreover, on the ten-story building at the center of the courtyard, several large, gilded characters, covered with red cloth, were prominently displayed. Clearly, this was the plaque of the acquiring company. And since morning, the stream of people entering the premises hadn’t ceased.\nAt this moment, inside a van, two figures looked out at the front gate, chatting intermittently.\nOne of them, about Su Ping’s age, was leaning against the car window, curiously looking out,\n\"Dad, what’s the deal with this pharmaceutical factory? In just a short while, I’ve seen at least a dozen of your colleagues!\"\nLi Senlin fiddled with his camera and issued some instructions to the photographer beside him before glancing at Li Shu, who had spoken, and gave him a sideways look, \"Just look at you, what future do you have following me? Even if you become an editor-in-chief, you’ll still end up with a monthly salary of tens of thousands at most. You won’t have to worry about food and clothing, but what about your future? Su Ping was willing to teach you back then, but you! Such a golden opportunity, and you didn’t seize it, running off halfway instead!\"\nLi Shu shrank back, somewhat dejected, \"I’m not a Forest Wolf Beast Tamer, and that’s not my specialty... All I did there day in and day out was reception work and shoveling crap; it was mind-numbingly boring...\"\nLi Senlin glared at his son, feeling a sense of helplessness, but ultimately, he could only sigh, \"Forget it. Just behave yourself for a while, kid. This is no small matter. If anything goes wrong, risking your old man’s entire fortune and life won’t save the situation!\"\n\"Is it that serious? No wonder even you, who’s been cooped up in an office for years, had to come out for this. Is the factory owner that influential? Aren’t you journalists called uncrowned kings?\" Li Shu asked curiously.\nLi Senlin glanced at his son.\nUncrowned kings? The real issue is that the boss behind this pharmaceutical company is an actual ’king’!\nHe then looked at the equally curious photographer and assistant before lowering his voice, \"It’s rumored that the new company’s boss is Queen Dong of Tianyun Group...\"\n\"Ah?\"\n\"Tianyun Group?\"\nIn Linzhou and Jianghai, hardly anyone was unaware of Tianyun Group’s fame. This held true even throughout the entire eastern region of Dragon Nation. Tianyun Group encompassed nearly every industry related to Pet Beasts and was Tightly interwoven with the lives of all Beast Tamers.\nLi Shu’s spirits instantly lifted, \"Queen Dong? Will I get to see her in person today?\"\nThe photographer nearby hurriedly leaned in, \"Editor Li, I heard that things haven’t been quiet at Tianyun Group lately!\"\nBefore Li Senlin could reply, Li Shu, who had always been curious, asked, \"Brother Zhang, what do you mean by ’not quiet’?\"\nThe photographer chuckled, \"Tianyun Group might be changing hands. It’s said that Tianyun Real Estate and Mirror Sky Entertainment, two of the group’s most influential subsidiaries, have been taken over by Dong Mutian, Queen Dong’s brother! Now that Queen Dong has established this new company, she’s clearly setting up for a confrontation! Indeed, the struggles for family fortunes among the powerful are even more exciting than TV dramas.\"\nLi Shu nodded, \"That said, doesn’t Tianyun Group already have its own Magic Potion factory subsidiary? Why is Queen Dong starting another one?\"\n\"Who knows? How could we possibly understand the thoughts of such important people? But even so, Queen Dong’s influence is immense. Never mind the media; I just saw several government officials, heads of major banks, and figures from other companies...\"\n\"Are there people from the two major associations?\"\n\"Probably. But generally, the key figures from the associations don’t get involved in such matters.\"\nIt was Li Senlin, however, who frowned and said, \"Enough of this idle chatter. What do the affairs of those bigwigs have to do with us? Are you tired of living?\"\nThe photographer, Zhang, flinched.\nJust then, someone knocked on the van window, \"You’re from the ’Linzhou Pet Beast Express,’ right? It’s almost time. Media friends, please head to the front and get ready!\"\nLi Senlin hurriedly put on a smile, \"Alright, thanks for the heads-up.\"\nThe person who reminded them said no more, nodded, and left. Li Senlin then urged, \"Quick, quick, let’s go!\"\nThe assistant, the photographer, and Li Shu, burdened with their equipment, hurried towards the main building in the factory courtyard.",

      "content": "Chapter 224: Chapter 146: Dong Mutian Who Came Knocking!_2\nThe seats and stage were already set up. Some figures had already taken their seats below the stage. Aside from Li Senlin, other local media members were also adjusting their cameras and other equipment, pointing their lenses towards the stage above.\nLi Senlin merely glanced and saw that, just as his assistant and the photographer had said, quite a number of prominent figures were already seated. These included heads of major banks and representatives from some well-known companies in Jianghai.\nHowever, Li Senlin clicked his tongue.\nThese people are indeed big shots, but that’s only from our perspective,\nhe mused.\nActually, in the parking lot just now, sitting in the front passenger seat, I saw things more clearly than the others. I definitely saw some people go into that large building up there, and they haven’t come out. Plus, the front seats are still empty. It’s obvious the truly important figures haven’t arrived yet.\nThinking of this, Li Senlin subconsciously raised his head and looked up at the company building behind the ribbon-cutting ceremony.\nThrough the morning sunlight, Li Senlin saw a figure standing before a large floor-to-ceiling window on the sixth floor, overlooking everyone waiting below.\nFor some reason, under the morning sun, Li Senlin felt an inexplicable sense of familiarity with the somewhat blurred figure.\nAs if I’ve seen them somewhere before?\nHowever, before Li Senlin could take a closer look, the figure turned back, denying him the chance to see more.\nLi Senlin’s eyebrows furrowed.\nHe then shook his head.\nNo, that’s not right. I must be tired from the lack of rest lately, just seeing things, perhaps?\nAlthough he knew some people in Linzhou, that hardly mattered. Let alone the individuals he actually knew, even the people currently seated outside were, from his perspective, inhabitants of a different world.\nAnd those who appeared in that building above, unless they were service staff of some kind, it was unlikely he would know them.\nWith that in mind, Li Senlin stopped overthinking. He picked up the prompt card again and glanced at the questions. These were to be used in conjunction with the other party’s publicity; his newspaper had already been briefed. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have sent him, the seasoned editor-in-chief, in person.\n「...」\nSu Ping yawned, feeling somewhat listless.\nClearly, he hadn’t slept well the night before. Or rather, he hadn’t slept at all.\nAfter a night of meditation, his Spiritual Realm had improved slightly.\nHe was a little closer to becoming an Elite Fourth Tier.\nWithout corresponding resources or a Secret Realm for Su Ping to initiate Space Absorption, the speed of this improvement was indeed slow.\nBut Su Ping didn’t mind; he took it as consolidating his foundation.\nThe rate at which his Level had increased was, in fact, ludicrous compared to other Beast Tamers his age.\nFrom just awakening to advancing to Elite Third Tier in merely three to four months.\nHis classmates who could reach a regular Sixth or Seventh Tier were considered to have fairly impressive Talent.\nOf course, Su Ping wasn’t actually tired; his current state was purely due to sheer boredom.\nTo him, haggling was already a tedious affair.\nAnd now, Su Ping realized something even more mind-numbing: watching others haggle.\nHe glanced at the two people beside him.\nSu Ping simply couldn’t fathom it. Dong Muyun was one thing; after all, he was a businessman, battle-hardened in negotiation. But for this damn Chief Lin, the Legion Commander with his thick brows and large eyes, to also be so surprisingly adept at bargaining, huh?\nChief Lin had arrived at six in the morning. Then, he accompanied Su Ping early to this new company factory park, in which Su Ping himself held a sixty percent stake. Subsequently, after greeting the arriving guests, instructing the reception staff, and following Lin Lei’s preliminary test of the Heart of the Wolf’s effects, Dong Muyun and Chief Lin began their negotiations.\nAt that moment, Su Ping even felt a bit nostalgic.\nWhy haven’t Sun Chaoju and those people from the Breeder Association arrived yet? Listening to these two haggle is truly less interesting than discussing Pet Beast cultivation with the folks from the Breeder Association. I might even be able to snag some benefits.\nIt was just unfortunate. In the past, when he wasn’t thinking of these people, they would appear faster than anyone. Yet today, it was past eight, and these folks still hadn’t shown up.\n\"Chief Lin, you know that the effects of this Magic Potion cannot be compared with those on the market! Sure, I know the auxiliary medicine ’Pet Spirit Potion’ is priced at 40,000 a bottle and can work for most Pet Beasts.\nBut, for the same effects, the Pet Spirit Potion at most enhances the absorption of the Magic Potion by about seven percent, and its effect diminishes with multiple doses!\nHow can you calculate its value using simple multiplication? The average effect of the Heart of the Wolf is four times that of the Pet Spirit Potion. So, if the price were also merely four times higher, would using four bottles of Pet Spirit Potion achieve the same result as one Heart of the Wolf?\nChief Lin, you’re no child. When a Magic Potion’s effect is doubled, it’s not unreasonable for its value to increase fivefold, let alone tenfold, wouldn’t you agree?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 225: Chapter 146: Dong Mutian Who Came Knocking!_3\nDong Muyun stated clearly, \"Of course, Heart of the Wolf can’t possibly sell for one or two million a bottle. That would contradict Pingyun’s principles. So the price I’m giving you is really very conscientious!\"\nLin Lei took a sip of water to moisten his somewhat dry throat, then said, \"Miss Dong, the problem is that the effects of Heart of the Wolf haven’t been fully confirmed. There’s a certain risk involved when I take this batch back. A price of 200,000 per bottle is really too difficult for me to justify. You know, this time, conservatively speaking, there’s definitely an order for at least two thousand units. And this is just for testing. Later on, the orders from the Legions will definitely not be few! Besides, although our Legion can’t pay directly in cash, we can trade with corresponding resources. You must realize that the price of some resources is far higher than their market value!\"\nDong Muyun sighed, glanced at Su Ping nearby, then said helplessly, \"The issue is the price of 180,000...\"\nSu Ping finally couldn’t watch any longer.\nDamn it, 180,000 still isn’t good enough?\nThat’s already a 500% profit margin.\nDon’t they say that for capitalists, with a 100% profit in sight, they’re ready to risk the gallows? And at 300%, they’re ready to trample over everything?\nStill not satisfied with 500%.\nIndeed, I’m not cut out to be a capitalist.\nSo, Su Ping said, \"Miss Dong, that’s about right. Chief Lin is from the Legion, after all, and he has taken good care of me. By selling this Magic Potion to the Legion, aren’t we also enhancing the power of Dragon Nation and further protecting our homeland?\"Lin Lei chuckled and gave a thumbs up. \"Xiao Ping, you truly have a higher awareness! Miss Dong, what do you say? If it’s acceptable, let’s sign the contract right now. And another thing, if your product’s effectiveness becomes well-known, will you still need to worry about demand? Not to mention other things, I can contact my old classmates and comrades from all over the country for you, how about that?\"\nAt these words, Dong Muyun’s eyes brightened.\nStill, she pretended to be reluctant as she said, \"If that’s the case, then alright...\"\nThe outcome of the negotiation was relatively smooth, bringing a smile to Dong Muyun’s lips.\nIf possible, even providing Heart of the Wolf to the Legions at a cheaper price wouldn’t have been an issue.\nHowever, it was still the same issue: Heart of the Wolf’s effects were too good, so good that it was hard to believe its cost was so minimal.\nAfter the contract was settled, both of them finally relaxed their tense nerves.\nLin Lei took another large gulp of water and said with some emotion, \"I had heard of Miss Dong’s reputation before, but seeing is truly believing. Compared to your brother...\"\nAt this point, Lin Lei’s voice trailed off, an awkward smile on his face.\nIt wasn’t very polite to evaluate her brother in front of her.\nDong Muyun didn’t seem to mind much, but she didn’t continue the topic either. After all, Dong Mutian’s actions reflected poorly on the Dong Family.\nAs of now, she was still a member of the Dong Family.\nSu Ping watched with interest.\nHe had only heard that Dong Muyun’s brother was in a Legion, but he didn’t know which one specifically.\nNow it seems Old Lin knows that Dong Family’s eldest son?\nLin Lei let out a long sigh, then stood up. \"Miss Dong, Su Ping, I’m going to report to General Zhao. Please excuse me!\"\n\"Please!\"\nAfter Lin Lei went to the next room to make a phone call, Dong Muyun finally breathed a sigh of relief and gave Su Ping a thumbs up. \"Nice cooperation!\"\nSu Ping blinked. \"Cooperation with what?\"\nDong Muyun took another sip of water. \"One hundred eighty thousand was an acceptable price already. I was just waiting for you to speak up so Chief Lin would owe you a favor. Then there wouldn’t be any future disputes or trouble with pricing. But you took so long to say anything, I thought you weren’t satisfied!\"\nIs that so?\nSu Ping began to doubt his life choices.\nSo, I was just pointlessly waiting around all this time, and it was my own damn fault?\nHave I just unwittingly become an accomplice to a capitalist?\nDamn it, there are too many schemes! A naive and gentle youth like me is too easily tricked.\nShaking his head helplessly, before Su Ping could speak, a phone rang. It wasn’t Su Ping’s; it was Dong Muyun’s.\nHowever, when Dong Muyun took out her phone and glanced at it, the smile on her face instantly transformed into a frown and a look of impatience.\nClearly, at this moment, under these circumstances, only one person could make her react this way.\n\"Hello, Dong Mutian?\"\nIt’s that eldest son of the Dong Family again?\nSu Ping raised an eyebrow but said nothing.\nHowever, he could visibly see Dong Muyun’s expression turn even uglier.\n\"Dong Mutian, you dare to track me?\"\nBut soon, Dong Muyun’s expression shifted again, twisting into an extremely odd and indescribable smirk.\n\"What, now you want to come in, you have to inform me in advance? Why don’t you use your Pet Beast to barge in forcefully?\"\n\"Hehehe, alright, alright. Give the phone to the security guard.\"\n\"Yes, I’m allowing him in. Tell him to come directly to the reception room on the sixth floor!\"\nAfter she hung up, Su Ping looked at Dong Muyun’s cold smile. He always had a feeling that whenever this woman smiled like that, it meant trouble.\nThe only difference is, this time it probably has nothing to do with me... right?\n「At the same time, at the entrance gate of the company campus, Dong Mutian also walked in with a sneer.」\nBeside Dong Mutian was a middle-aged man with a wooden expression.\n\"Dong San, later you’d better tell Father everything you see! This despicable woman not only dares to use the Group’s assets to keep a gigolo, but now she’s also using the Group’s resources under her own name to start this damn company! What is she trying to do?\"\nWith that said, the two men ignored the astonished gazes of some people in front of the ribbon-cutting stage and marched straight into the building!",

      "content": "Chapter 226: Chapter 147 ’Pretty Boy’s’ Identity! Woman’s Lies!\n\"Fuck! Fuck! Did you guys just see that?\"\nAt this moment, beneath the stage, a figure excitedly spoke to a colleague beside him.\nLi Senlin skeptically glanced at the youngster, then at the prominent, well-informed figures of Linzhou City, noting their shocked and astonished expressions.\n\"What’s the matter?\" Li Shu asked curiously.\nAll the equipment had been adjusted; they were just waiting for someone to come out.\n\"Goodness, I’m not sure this ribbon-cutting ceremony can proceed smoothly today!\"\n\"Dong Mutian is here? Is he planning to pick a fight with Queen Dong?\"\n\"Who the hell knows! Damn, I really want to go up there and see what on earth is going on!\"\n\"Dong Mutian is here?!\"\nAs soon as this person spoke, everyone exchanged bewildered glances.\nRecently, those who were even slightly in the know had heard about the internal power struggle within Tianyun Group.\nSome believed this current incident was Dong Muyun’s act of defiance against the Dong Family.\nIt was rumored that she, along with a mysterious shareholder, had established a company entirely separate from the Dong Family’s affairs.\nInitially, some thought the siblings, Dong Muyun and Dong Mutian, would use Tianyun Group as their battleground for a protracted struggle. Some high-level executives at Tianyun were even contemplating which side to support.\nBut unexpectedly, Queen Dong’s first countermove was to break away entirely?\nAnd now, Dong Mutian had come knocking directly at their door!\nAnyone could guess that an unimaginable commotion was about to erupt within that building.\nUnfortunately for these onlookers, it was difficult for them to witness it firsthand, but enjoying the drama from the sidelines undoubtedly satisfied many.\nDong Mutian clearly paid no heed to the buzzing discussions behind him; he was well aware of his sister’s extensive network in Linzhou, built over many years.\nBut today was perfect. He intended to humiliate Dong Muyun in front of everyone.\nHe would make her understand that the Dong Family, and he, the legitimate eldest son, were the ones who truly deserved the utmost importance.\nDING.\nThe elevator reached the sixth floor, and Dong Mutian quickly found the large reception room.\nWithout a second thought, he pushed the door open and entered.\nSure enough, Dong Muyun and that kid he had seen on the screen were both in the reception room.\n\"My dear sister, I haven’t seen you in days. I’ve missed you terribly,\" Dong Mutian said, looking at the two seated on the sofa. He wanted to see panic on Dong Muyun’s face and fear on that brat’s, but unfortunately, he saw neither.\nDong Muyun wore a calm, faint smile, seemingly unconcerned by his arrival.\nAs for the so-called ’kept boy,’ he remained entirely nonchalant, appearing as if he were merely an uninvolved bystander.\n\"I haven’t missed you one bit. What are you doing here?\" Dong Muyun retorted.\nIn front of Su Ping and Dong San, Dong Muyun refrained from harsh words. After all, she had worked hard to change Su Ping’s impression of her and saw no reason to ruin it over someone like Dong Mutian.\n\"Naturally, I’m here to see what kind of stunt you’ve pulled! Dong Muyun, you’ve got some nerve, don’t you? Using the Group’s connections and resources to start your own company?\"\nDong Muyun guessed this guy was here to find fault. When she glanced at Dong San beside her, whose expression was impassive, she understood even more clearly that Dong San was representing their father!\nDong Muyun’s eyes narrowed slightly.\nHowever, she wasn’t sure if this was the right opportunity.\nSo, she didn’t speak, and neither did Su Ping.\nIn fact, Su Ping wondered if he should leave now and cede the stage to the siblings.\nUnfortunately, Dong Mutian’s next words made Su Ping, who had thought he could remain an outsider, take a hard look at this young master of the Dong Family.\n\"What’s this now? You even brought your little lover along? Don’t tell me this little company of yours was opened just for your sweetheart, Dong Muyun? I never realized it before. I’ve played with so many women, seen plenty, but I’ve never encountered one like you, so eager to throw herself at someone! What is it? Are you afraid your little lover will find you too old and dump you? You’re giving away resources, property, and now even companies? You’re not going to suddenly give away Tianyun Group, or even the entire Dong Family, one day, are you?\"\nAt these words, Dong Muyun’s face turned pale, purely from anger.\nHowever, what worried her more was whether Su Ping might misunderstand something.\nFortunately, Su Ping merely frowned slightly, observing Dong Mutian with keen interest.\nPreviously, Dong Muyun had told Su Ping more than once about this useless brother of hers.\nSu Ping had originally thought she was exaggerating. Now, it seemed, that was absolutely the case. Among influential Families, although there’s a system, not everyone is outstanding, are they? Talent and aptitude as a Beast Tamer aside, in terms of practical ability, Dong Mutian was clearly far inferior to Dong Muyun.\nOf course, he wasn’t angry. He knew Dong Mutian’s words were utter bullshit. No one gets angry over lies that are obviously bullshit; only the guilty would get furious.\nOn the contrary, from another perspective, this guy was practically admitting Su Ping had what it takes to be a kept man—for instance, his handsome looks... Hmm, thinking of it this way, Su Ping actually felt a little inexplicably smug?\n\"Dong Mutian, leave now. We can talk when I have time. I don’t want you to ruin the Dong Family’s image in front of others!\"",

I told you to find a reliable man to marry, but you refused, insisting on finding someone you truly loved to join the Dong Family. In the end, isn’t it just because you’re worried that if you marry out, you won’t get a share of the family assets?\nThe iron tree has bloomed, has it? Suddenly interested in men, are you? You’ve found yourself a pretty boy and even invited so many people to watch the opening ceremony of your ridiculous company. Aren’t you just tarnishing the Dong Family’s reputation?\"\nDong Muyun watched Dong Mutian, spit flying as he ranted, and sighed deeply.\nShe turned to Dong San.\n\"Dong San, please take my brother away. I will explain it to Father later... This has nothing to do with Su Ping.\"\nDong San responded gloomily, \"Eldest Miss, I’m sorry, but the Master’s orders are for me to accompany the Young Master...\"\nDong Muyun frowned.\n\"Enough, Dong Muyun! Hand over your shares of Tianyun Group, and none of this will matter! Women belong at home, taking care of their husbands and children. Why go out and seek attention?!\"\nDong Mutian smacked his lips, as if he had everything under control.\nHowever, a glint of light flashed in the depths of Dong Muyun’s eyes before she said, \"Dong Mutian, what right do you have to take my shares? Or is this the wish of our Father or Grandfather? Have you finally revealed your true intentions?\"\nDong Mutian opened his mouth to speak, but before he could get a word out, Dong Muyun’s eyes had reddened. \"Are Grandfather and Father really so heartless? What? Is a daughter of the Dong Family no longer considered part of the Dong Family? Now that I’ve done everything for the Dong Family, you want to cast me aside? Fine! From now on, I’ll sever my ties with the Dong Family and won’t be a part of it! Are you satisfied now?\"\nTo be honest, Dong Muyun’s outburst caught Dong Mutian off guard.\nIn his eyes, his sister had always been resilient and unyielding; he had never seen her look so aggrieved.\nEven he began to question himself, wondering if he had gone too far.\nThinking about it, it seemed so. He had played with so many women, spent a considerable amount of the family’s money, and wasted a lot of resources. In comparison, his sister’s issue didn’t seem like such a big deal from the family’s perspective, did it?\nEven Dong San chimed in, \"Eldest Miss, the Old Master and the Master didn’t mean it that way...\"\n\"Tsk, as entertaining as this drama is, I have to say, your Dong Family is indeed a bit disgraceful. Is this the so-called behavior of these prestigious families?\"\nJust then, a voice came from outside.\nLin Lei pushed the door open, his lips curled in disdain and mockery.\nDong San abruptly turned to look at him. \"Who are you? Give me one reason, or I’ll accuse you of insulting the Dong Family...\"\nLin Lei glanced at the loyal family retainer, then at the dumbfounded Dong Mutian, and said with a slight smile, \"Camp Commander Dong, aren’t you going to introduce to this devoted old servant of yours exactly who I am?\"\nDong Mutian’s lips twitched, and he managed to force an incredibly awkward smile. \"Lin... Chief Lin, what are you doing here?\"\nChief Lin?\nDong San was also taken aback, struggling to grasp the situation.\n\"Well, Camp Commander Dong—or rather, you no longer have the right to wear that rank and certainly don’t hold the position anymore. Dong Mutian, considering you were once seconded under my command for a while, I’ll overlook your ignorance this time!\nNext time, if you insult an honorary officer of our Legion, even if the Dong Family backs you, the Legion will definitely not let you off!\"\n\"Ah?\"\nDong Mutian blinked, seemingly a little slow to catch on. Why did he feel like he couldn’t understand what was being said? Whom had he insulted?\nRegrettably, Lin Lei didn’t intend to give him a chance to argue and continued, \"Never mind that you’re no longer part of the Legion. Even if you were still a Camp Commander, you should respect fellow officers of the same rank. Moreover, the Legion’s honorary officers are considered one rank higher than active-duty officers!\"\nLin Lei spoke these words with utmost sincerity.\nAfter all, comparing Dong Mutian to Su Ping... Forget it, there was no point in comparing. It would be an insult to Su Ping.\nAs a soldier under General Zhao, Lin Lei had absolutely no respect for someone like Dong Mutian. However, he did appreciate Dong Muyun’s recent stance.\nThese so-called prestigious families, in their struggle for wealth and power, where was the kinship? His own little princess had been spoiled rotten by him and his son. In contrast, Dong Muyun had always been diligent and loyal to the Dong Family, and now they were creating a situation where she’d be discarded after her usefulness ended?\n\"Chief, whom did I insult?\" Dong Mutian asked, looking aggrieved.\n\"The ’pretty boy’ you mentioned is a Legion hero, personally awarded the rank of Honorary Major by General Zhao himself! Are you saying that someone recognized by General Zhao can be casually insulted by you?\"\nLin Lei’s words were hard for Dong Mutian to swallow. After holding back for a while, he still couldn’t help but let out an \"Ah?\" in astonishment.\nMeanwhile, Dong San lowered his gaze even more, looking utterly humbled.\n\"This time, Miss Dong and Major Su have jointly developed a new Magic Potion for market release, and this venture also involves collaboration with the Legion! Do you understand now?\"\n\"Ah?\"\nDong Mutian seemed capable of uttering only this one word. He looked at his sister, whose eyes were red and brimming with tears, then at the calm and composed Su Ping. He also glanced at Lin Lei’s mocking smile before turning his head to say, \"Sister...\"\n\"Don’t say anything...\"\nDong Muyun choked back a sob, then looked at Dong San, who had taken a position behind her.",

      "content": "Chapter 228: Chapter 147 ’Pretty Boy’s’ Identity! Woman’s Lies!_3\n\"Dong San, hurry up and get him out of here. I don’t want to see you guys right now. Also, don’t let Father call me; I don’t want to take his calls. If he really wants Tianyun’s shares, I’ll give them to him. But my things... they’re not so easy to take.\"\n\"This... Yes, Miss.\"\nDong San left with a stunned Dong Mutian in tow.\nLin Lei also smiled, \"Miss Dong, you don’t have to be so sad. It’s not worth it for family members like that. Alright, I’ll head down first.\"\nDong Muyun forced a smile, \"Mm, I’ll see you out.\"\nSu Ping, evidently perceptive, said, \"No need, I’ll take Uncle Lin down.\"\nFinally, the reception room was empty save for Dong Muyun. The visage of this Queen Dong underwent a sudden transformation. She stood up, her expression filled with satisfaction as she approached the floor-to-ceiling window, looking down upon the people awaiting below.\nNo longer was there any trace of the sadness or hurt from before. A smile appeared at the corner of her mouth.\nWhat a pity. Dong Muyun only regretted that she didn’t have a glass of red wine at this moment. Otherwise, she really would have liked to taste it.\nShe seemed to shed an enormous burden instantly. Observing Dong Mutian dejectedly following Dong San out of the building, she softly murmured, \"The light boat has passed through ten thousand layers of mountains.\"\n\"What ten thousand layers of mountains?\" Su Ping’s voice came from behind her.\nDong Muyun turned around, \"Didn’t you go to see Chief Lin out?\"\n\"Chief Lin asked me to come and comfort you.\" Su Ping shrugged. \"What are you standing here for? You’re not thinking of summoning Yunning to kill Dong Mutian, are you? That’s unnecessary, and besides, he’s still your elder brother...\"\nLooking at Su Ping before her, Dong Muyun actually revealed a smile, \"Do you think I’m troubled?\"\nSu Ping raised an eyebrow, \"Not troubled? Stop pretending. There’s no one else here. If you need to vent, you can use my shoulder.\"\nSu Ping had been an orphan in his previous life and had Su Anyong in this one, so he treasured familial affection deeply. To him, family ties were one of the greatest bonds. Thus, he might find the squabbles of wealthy families amusing. However, seeing Dong Muyun verbally abused and relentlessly pressured by her own elder brother genuinely saddened him.\n\"Pah! Brat, who are you calling ’bro’?\" Although Dong Muyun feigned annoyance, the smile never left her lips. \"I’m fine, Su Ping. Don’t be so naive in the future. Haven’t you ever heard? The more beautiful a woman is, the more deceptive she is! A beautiful woman’s lies and tears are the most effective weapons.\"\nSu Ping had certainly heard this, but he cast a doubtful look at her. \"So I guess that means you wouldn’t deceive anyone, huh?\"\nDong Muyun was taken aback, then slapped him on the head, \"I can see that your observation skills and your Cultivation talent are inversely proportional. Also, you’ve lost your sports car.\"\n\"No, wait... I was just joking. You’re the most beautiful, alright? And what did you deceive anyone about? Don’t tell me you just toyed with emotions?\"\n\"I’ve deceived you!\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"Think about it slowly...\" Dong Muyun trailed off.\nSu Ping was speechless.\nDamn, cryptic people are infuriating!\n「...」\nDong Mutian’s expression turned extremely ugly. He never expected such an outcome from a situation he thought was in the bag.\nThat kid wasn’t Dong Muyun’s kept man? And not only that, he had such a powerful background? How old was that kid? An honorary Major in the Legion? Even personally recognized by General Zhao?\nAnd this time, Lin Lei had personally come to show his support—the very man who had co-founded the company with Dong Muyun. With such influential connections, Dong Mutian somewhat understood why Dong Muyun had been so solicitous before. This had led him to believe the kid was her kept man.\nThinking of this, Dong Mutian finally said, \"Dong San, find out what’s going on with this Su Ping.\"\nDong San really wanted to retort.\nAre you only thinking of investigating now? What’s the damn point anymore? What were you doing before?\nBut faced with this young master, what could he say?\nHe could only prepare to agree.\nHowever, just as they were stepping out the main entrance, a voice suddenly called out.\n\"Su Ping?! You’re Xiao Ping’s friend, huh?\"\nDong Mutian’s brows furrowed. He almost flinched just hearing the name. He looked up to see who had spoken. An old man was leading them, followed by more than a dozen people. This time, Dong Mutian genuinely didn’t dare to act arrogantly any longer.\nBefore he could reply, the old man before him said with a beaming smile, \"I was just about to call Xiao Ping. Now it seems I won’t need to trouble him to come out and greet us. My friend, where is Su Ping?\"\nWhen the old man came closer, Dong Mutian suddenly felt he looked familiar, but he couldn’t recall where exactly he had seen him. He just found him familiar. Still, he said, \"In the building behind, on the sixth floor. But you can’t go up without an ID card...\"\n\"Heh, thanks for the reminder. Much appreciated.\" The old man chuckled, thanked Dong Mutian, and then headed inside.\n\"Teacher, we have to get an explanation from this kid when we go up!\" someone with the old man spoke up.\n\"Indeed, hahaha! He told us all, but didn’t say a word to you, Teacher! He clearly doesn’t respect you as the Vice Chairman, haha!\"\n\"You little rascals, stop trying to stir up trouble! Can the bond I share with Su Ping be undermined by youngsters like you?\"\nThe laughter gradually faded away.\nDong Mutian, however, didn’t move. He turned his head doubtfully to look at the group. The leading old man seemed to sense his gaze, turned his head, smiled, and nodded at him.\nDong Mutian blinked. He stopped walking and directly took out his phone, searching for something online.\nVice Chairman? In Dragon Nation, this title was undoubtedly significant everywhere.\nSoon, he found a face on his phone identical to that of the old man. Then, Dong Mutian stared at the name and position on the screen as if he had seen a ghost.",

      "content": "Chapter 229: Chapter 148 We Won’t Be Younger Than Today!\nOld Liu’s arrival didn’t catch Su Ping by surprise. Even though Su Ping hadn’t notified him, Old Liu had the sort of temperament to actively show up and offer support, so his presence wasn’t at all surprising. However, it was clear that Old Liu hadn’t anticipated Su Ping’s partner being Dong Muyun.\n\"Old Liu, why didn’t you let me know you were coming? I would have gone down to meet you!\" Su Ping said with a smile.\nOld Liu waved his hand, glancing at Dong Muyun with keen interest, \"I didn’t expect that the production of Heart of the Wolf would involve Miss Dong. I’m not sure if this cooperation involves the Dong Family and the Tianyun Group, or if it’s...\"\nLiu Fuhai didn’t even respond to Su Ping’s greeting and went straight to asking Dong Muyun that question.\nThe latter clearly understood what Old Liu meant and hastily replied, \"Old Liu, this is a personal collaboration between me and Su Ping; it has nothing to do with the Dong Family or Tianyun!\"\nLin Lei, who accompanied Liu Fuhai, chuckled from the side, \"On that point, I can vouch for Miss Dong...\"\nOld Liu looked at Lin Lei with surprise, then nodded without saying anything further.\nDong Muyun also understood and quickly said, \"Old Liu, the ribbon-cutting is about to start. I should check on how the preparations are going downstairs. Please excuse me for a moment.\"\nAfter she left, Liu Fuhai turned to look at Su Ping, \"Xiao Ping, as your mentor, I, Old Liu, must brazenly offer you a piece of advice. Dong Muyun herself is one thing, but you should maintain a certain distance from the Dong Family. If it’s just Dong Muyun, it might not mean much, but if it involves the internal affairs of the Dong Family, try not to get too close!\"\nSu Ping was taken aback for a moment before nodding his head.\n\"The current higher-ups are cracking down hard on these ancient Beast Tamer Families! You have an infinitely bright future; there’s no need to get involved in the murky waters of these factional struggles!\" Liu Fuhai said meaningfully with a smile.\nThen, without waiting for Su Ping to respond, he changed the subject, \"Xiao Sun mentioned you were asking about Mu Yu. Is it because the Paperman’s progress isn’t going smoothly?\"\nUpon hearing this, Su Ping was slightly startled.\nDamn it, Sun Chaoju is such a leaky sieve; he lets everything slip out!\nSu Ping nodded, then shook his head, \"It’s alright. I was just a bit curious before. As for the Paperman, I’ve already made some progress!\"\n\"Oh?\"\nCompared to Sun Chaoju, Vice President Liu had a deeper appreciation of Su Ping’s Talent.\nHe narrowed his eyes slightly, \"Su Ping, Qin Erlong mentioned that your second Pet Beast is a Paperman, right?\"\n\"Yes, it’s a mutated Paperman.\"\n\"That’s bold! Back then, Mu Yu made some mistakes concerning the Paperman, which allowed some people to take advantage of the situation. Of course, he also lacked firm resolve and idolized that Undead Breeding Master from Eagle Country to an extreme degree,\" Old Liu remarked with some emotion.\nHowever, after a pause, he continued, \"Mutated Pet Beasts are difficult to confine to established evolution patterns. For all Necromancy Beast Tamers, the Paperman is the shame of the Necromancy Series/System. However, if your Paperman is a mutation, it might still have a chance to achieve Evolution!\"\nUndoubtedly, Old Liu had considerable authority in this area.\nSu Ping was suddenly more interested, \"How so?\"\nCurrently, both his Pet Beasts were, as fate would have it, mutated: the Forest Wolf with dual Wood and Poison Attributes, and the Metal-Undead Paperman.\nIt could be said that, compared to ordinary Pet Beasts of the same type, his Mutated Pet Beasts actually restricted his path as a Beast Tamer.\nNaturally, Su Ping was energized upon hearing President Liu speak about the cultivation and Evolution of Mutated Pet Beasts.\n\"Mutated Pet Beasts are extremely rare in themselves, formed only under specific circumstances. Their mutant characteristics, Traits, and Attributes all differ from others.\nAn extra Attribute naturally means an additional channel that can be explored! In what way did your Paperman mutate?\"\n\"Um, the Metal Element, and it has exceptional control over sword-type Skills!\" Su Ping quickly replied.\nLiu Fuhai nodded, \"Do you remember what I said in class? Theoretically, a Pet Beast’s Evolutionary Body has infinite possibilities. This is a Rule of the Beast Tamer world!\nThe essence of Evolution is when a Pet Beast’s corresponding ability breaks through to a peak, reaching a new realm beyond its previous limitations. So, if you want to try progressing in this direction, you can definitely start with the Metal Element, or what you might call this Sword Type.\nMetal Element Skills, cultivating resources for it, and sword-type Skills—these are all potential directions. Of course, you’ll need to experiment personally and observe carefully. As soon as you notice any changes or promising signs, you must analyze them promptly to decide whether to continue or stop...\"\nLiu Fuhai explained tirelessly.\nAlthough he wasn’t a Breeder specializing in the Undead, he was a Senior Breeder with many years of experience.\nIn many aspects of Pet Beast cultivation, it’s often the case that understanding one principle unlocks many others.\nAlthough Su Ping hadn’t chosen another Wolf Pet as his second Contracted Beast, which Old Liu found somewhat regrettable, he would still continue to help Su Ping in this aspect without reservation.\nIn just this short while, Su Ping’s understanding of Mutated Pet Beasts had undergone an earth-shattering change.\nThe value of Mutated Pet Beasts often even surpasses the assessment of their Racial Potential.\nAs Old Liu put it, it comes down to \"high risk and high reward!\"\nIndeed, any Mutated Pet Beast represents the prospect of high reward.",

It was just a ribbon-cutting, and it was mainly out of respect for Su Ping.\nHowever, once these four names were announced, the room fell silent.\nMost of the people present did not know who Lin Lei was. However, coming from the Beast Tamer Legion, he clearly wasn’t an ordinary character.\nThey might not have known Lin Lei, but how could they possibly not know President Liu of the Breeder Association?\nHe had actually come?\nEvidently, the two major associations maintained a low profile. After just a brief glimpse earlier, it was difficult for many to recognize that this squinty-eyed old man was indeed Vice President Liu, the one who now truly controlled the Breeder Association.\nThis was the astonishment of some people.\nAs for the other group, it consisted of the few who knew Su Ping’s identity. For instance, the bank managers who had arrived and were on good terms with Dong Muyun.\nClearly, they had known for some time that Dong Muyun had an unusual relationship with the young man who had once approached them for a loan. But they hadn’t anticipated that the so-called Pingyun Company, established now, was actually in partnership with Su Ping.\nHowever, the most notable reaction came from a father and son duo standing to one side.\n\"Xiaoshu, did I hear that wrong?\" Li Senlin asked, looking as if he was doubting his very existence.\n\"You heard right! I told you I wouldn’t get it wrong. I might mistake others, but how could I possibly mistake Bro Ping?!\"\nLi Shu stared incredulously at the front row. Sure enough, four figures stood up simultaneously and walked towards the main podium.\nScissors wrapped in red cloth were placed in the hands of the four individuals.\nAnd among them was Su Ping, wearing what Li Shu instantly recognized as his ’Su Ping-style fake smile.’\nLi Shu’s eyes lit up with excitement.\nThis special feeling, akin to ’bumping into an old acquaintance in a foreign land,’ felt truly wonderful to him.\nHowever, unlike his son, Li Senlin understood more clearly what this all represented and what had transpired.\nFrom the very beginning, Li Senlin had seen that this young Breeder was no mere fish in a pond. But Li Senlin had never imagined that this ’fish’ was already on the verge of Dragon Transformation, and in such a short time too!\nLi Senlin’s expression was somewhat complex.\nLi Shu, however, had already snapped out of his daze. Without a second thought, he pulled a cell phone from his pocket. He aimed it upwards and took a photo of Su Ping and the others, who were following the host’s directions on the stage. Then, he immediately sent it to their old student group chat, which had been quiet for a long time.\nSu Ping had left the group chat long ago. After graduation, the classmates had all gone their separate ways and chatted infrequently.\nUndoubtedly, Li Shu’s photo popping up was quite sudden.\nSo, he even added a comment:\n\"Bro Ping looks so cool!\"\n\"Is that Su Ping? Is he at a ribbon-cutting? Is his family’s breeding base opening a branch?\"\nThis wasn’t just anyone speaking; it was Yin Yin, the so-called school beauty whom Li Shu had always been interested in.\nIf it were any other time, Li Shu would have definitely chimed in. But now, looking at his phone, his brow furrowed slightly.\nOpening a branch? Why would they think that? Don’t they know who those people on stage are? If it were just a branch opening, why would there be such a huge commotion?\nFor a moment, Li Shu was unsure what to say.\nHis message had undoubtedly attracted the attention of some classmates. They had all witnessed Su Ping’s capabilities before.\nNow, most of them were singing his praises. Even Zhou Shuchen sent a message:\n\"Classmate Su Ping is truly remarkable. He might even become the pride of our Sixth Middle School, Class Two, in the future! We should all learn from Classmate Su Ping! /Thumbs Up/Thumbs Up/Thumbs Up.\"\nThis attitude was a stark contrast to his demeanor a few months prior.\nClearly, a few months had been enough for this class president to recognize what reality was truly like. In the world of Beast Tamers, the rules were completely different from those in school. He had experienced the harsh blows of reality.\nBut perhaps because of this, Li Shu was once again unsure what to say. Should he just start bragging to these former classmates in the group chat on Su Ping’s behalf? Tell them that the amiable, smiling old man standing right next to Su Ping was Vice President Liu of the Jianghai Breeder Association? That the woman beside him was the renowned Queen Dong of Jianghai? Tell them that their former classmate was now capable enough to start a company in partnership with Dong Muyun! But even if he told them, would they understand who Dong Muyun was, or what being the Vice President of the Breeder Association truly represented? Perhaps the end result would be the same regardless. To most of them, the Su Ping of the past and the Su Ping of today were essentially the same: just incredibly impressive.\nAnd so, after the initial, restless urge to share this earth-shattering secret had subsided, Li Shu found himself unsure of what to say in the group chat. He thought he could somewhat understand Su Ping’s feelings now. Sometimes, certain things were just... rather pointless.\nAt that moment, Li Shu suddenly understood many things. He somewhat understood why Su Ping had left this so-called \"classmates’ group chat\" so long ago. He also understood why, after his return from the Heart of Woods, his contact with Su Ping had dwindled. It was different from before, when they could occasionally exchange a few casual words. Now, it had been over a month since they had last chatted.",

Setting other things aside, your presence here today isn’t on my account...\"\n\"...\"\nLi Shu looked at Su Ping, who stood on the stage, and then at the polite laughter that quickly followed from the audience as Su Ping interacted with the person next to him. Li Shu’s expression turned somewhat dazed.\nThis continued until Li Senlin, who was beside him, spoke to the nearby photographer:\n\"Be ready, it’s time for the media reporters to ask their questions.\"\nLi Senlin, holding a cue card, said to someone nearby.\nThe questions from these media were actually quite similar.\nWhat does Pingyun Company produce?\nHow effective is the product?\nWhat is the company’s production capacity and how do they envision their future prospects?\nThe media, after all, does this sort of work and earns this kind of money.\nIf you invested money to start a farm breeding pig-like beasts, they could still ask you questions like, \"What kind of Evolutionary Bodies are you cultivating to make the meat tastier and juicier?\"\nEssentially, it’s just a channel for publicity.\nHowever, just then, Li Shu suddenly said:\n\"Dad, can I go up and do the interview with you?\"\nLi Senlin looked skeptically at his eldest son.\nThe boy had just sent a message and had stood there in a daze ever since, lost in thought.\nHowever, Li Senlin also knew what his son was thinking.\nHe pursed his lips slightly and then, with a grit of his teeth, said:\n\"Fine, but you should know, what sort of occasion is this? If you want to reminisce with that person up there, pick a good time to do it!\"\nLi Shu, of course, knew that his dad was putting his career on the line to help fulfill his son’s wish. If anything went wrong—for instance, if he went up and asked about Dong Muyun and the recent Dong Mutian incident—getting kicked out would be a light consequence, and even his father’s position as editor-in-chief wouldn’t save him.\n\"The ribbon-cutting ceremony is completed, members of the press are now welcome to come up for interviews.\"\nImmediately, the local Jianghai media who had been waiting on the side advanced to the front, proceeding in order.\n\"Miss Dong, what made you choose to invest personally and cooperate with Breeder Su to establish Pingyun Company?\"\nDong Muyun smiled slightly and took the microphone,\n\"Of course, it’s because of our absolute confidence in our company’s product. It is a trans-era product named ’Heart of the Wolf’...\"\nAs Dong Muyun introduced the product, a series of gasps emanated from the audience.\nThis time, it wasn’t an act; it was genuine.\nIf the effect of the Heart of the Wolf was really as strong as claimed, then indeed its future was boundlessly bright.\nAnd hearing that the Legions, various Breeder bases, and even the Association had already placed orders, everyone looked at each other in astonishment.\nThen, it was time for the next question:\n\"Miss Dong, if the Heart of the Wolf is so magical, then what is its price?\"\n\"She chuckled. ’This is indeed a question on everyone’s mind. Before launching, we conducted thorough market research...’\"\nOne question followed another, as the reporters who had prepared in advance took turns on stage. Finally, it was Li Senlin’s turn.\n\"Miss Dong, Pingyun Company has only launched this one product so far. What will the positioning of Pingyun Company be in the future...\"\n\"This...\"\nSu Ping had actually not been paying attention to the interview at all, still idly chatting with Liu Fuhai on the side.\nHowever, hearing this voice, he turned his head in surprise and immediately saw Li Senlin, who, although asking Dong Muyun a question, couldn’t help but shoot glances at him.\nHe had only met Li Senlin once.\nTherefore, it took him a while to finally remember who this person was.\nMeeting his surprised gaze, Li Senlin smiled at everyone and stepped down from the stage.\nWhat surprised Su Ping next was that Li Shu really did come up.\nEven Dong Muyun was slightly stunned, as if she hadn’t expected such a young journalist, and the host beside her reacted similarly.\nLi Shu, however, paid no attention to these surprised looks, his fingers turning somewhat white from gripping the microphone,\n\"I would like to ask Breeder Su...\"\nAlas, before he could finish, the host promptly interrupted,\n\"I’m sorry, Mr. Journalist, Breeder Su does not accept interviews. If you have any questions, you can ask me or Manager Dong.\"\nBut Su Ping smiled and, looking at Li Shu, waved his hand,\n\"It’s okay, let him speak.\"\nDong Muyun gave him a surprised look. Li Shu smiled, took a deep breath, and asked a question that was actually quite commonplace, yet it brought a sigh of relief to many in the audience,\n\"Breeder Su, you are so young but have achieved so much. Do you have any experience or words you would like to share with your peers or former classmates?\"\nSu Ping, however, was slightly taken aback. He had even prepared for this guy to come up with some unreliable antics or questions.\nHe hadn’t expected this. Just when he thought the young man was going to be unpredictable, he suddenly became perfectly sensible?\nPerhaps this, too, was a kind of unpredictability?\nThe microphone was passed to him. Su Ping became a bit more serious this time. After thinking for a moment, he said,\n\"I don’t think I’m qualified to answer this question because, in my view, I am just lucky, not in a position high enough to lecture so-called peers.\n\"However, if we’re talking about experience, I do have some trivial insights, which is nothing other than to work hard.\n\"If you want to become a certain kind of person, just strive in that direction. Of course, I’m not trying to offer some empty motivational speech, nor am I saying you absolutely have to become outstanding in fields like Beast Tamers or Breeders. Rather, it’s about looking within and asking yourself what kind of person you want to be, or simply what it is you truly want to do.\n\"If you want to do something, go do it, because no day in the future will be more suitable than today. We will not be any younger than we are today.\"\nThe midday autumn sunlight, filtering through the patchy yellowing leaves, shone on his cheeks.\nSu Ping’s smile was faint.\nLi Shu appeared thoughtful.\nThe audience below applauded, some sincerely, some just for show.\nOnly Liu Fuhai clicked his tongue in admiration: \"Like wanting to buy the aroma of sweet osmanthus...\"\nHowever, Old Liu’s exclamation was cut short; he scratched his head, unable to recall the rest of the verse, and could only helplessly shake his head again.\nYet, from the corner of his eye, he saw Dong Muyun nearby. She was cupping her chin, her previous composure entirely gone, her beautiful eyes shining brightly as she stared intently at Su Ping.\nLiu Fuhai’s brow, which had been furrowed, smoothed out.\nAt this moment, he suddenly felt that the worries Qin Erlong had previously shared with him were not entirely unfounded.",

      "content": "Chapter 233: Chapter 149: Breakthrough Promotion! The Little Paper Man’s New Skills!\nBy the time Su Ping returned to the Heart of Woods, it was already dusk. Su Ping had made up his mind. He would never get involved in this kind of mess again, come hell or high water.\nFame might sound appealing, but from what Su Ping saw, it really wasn’t for him.\nSo, Su Ping directly asked Dong Muyun for help, requesting that his involvement be omitted from this round of interviews and publicity. All present media were given a gag order, and Su Ping was edited out of the footage as well.\nAlthough, if he participated in the upcoming Breeder competition and did well, he would undoubtedly become famous, but a day of peace was a day gained.\nHowever, thinking of the media just now, Su Ping remembered Li Shu. Why was that guy there?\nAs for Li Shu, Su Ping was quite considerate. If the other party was willing, Su Ping could help him get started on the path of a Breeder. After all, he was one of the few people in this world Su Ping could genuinely call a friend.\nBut, as Su Ping had told him, you need to know what kind of person you want to become.\nWhether you want to stand out or just enjoy life lying down, it’s a personal choice. The former has no right to criticize the latter, and the latter shouldn’t disparage the former.\nThe real fear is being lost, not knowing what you want to do.\nShaking his head, Su Ping wasn’t one to dwell on these matters.\nSince arriving in this world, his goal had never changed: to become the most extraordinary Beast Tamer and Breeder. Now he had added another: to study more Pet Beasts and perfect the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas.\nAs a result, Su Ping had acquired something new in his hand. It was a transparent stone. At first glance, it looked somewhat like a diamond, but it lacked the diamond’s brilliant cut facets and instead had a gentler, more subdued luster.\nThis object was given to him by Lin Lei. It was named the ’Spirit Communication Stone.’\nIt was an incredibly rare and valuable Commander Level psychic resource.\nAmong all types of resources, Time Series resources are undoubtedly the rarest. But in fact, psychic resources are absolutely the most precious! No other resource, with roughly the same effect and Rank, can be more valuable than psychic resources. Price-wise, they are the highest.\nSpiritual Pet Beasts are also considered the hardest to nurture, with no exceptions! The reason is simple: psychic resources can be used not only on rare Spiritual Pet Beasts but also on Beast Tamers themselves. That alone left nothing else that could compare.\nIndeed, at this very moment, the Spirit Communication Stone in Su Ping’s hand, despite being a Commander Level psychic resource, required an expenditure of 1,050 Battle Merit Points to purchase through the Legion! Keep in mind, even a Monarch Level Sun Crystal in the Legion store only costs 1,100 points!\nWhat does that tell you?! The price of a Commander Level psychic resource is comparable to other Monarch Level resources!\nOf course, Sun Crystals are relatively simple and easy to produce, ranking on the lower end of value among Monarch Level resources. That was one factor. But it clearly showed the value of the Spirit Communication Stone.\nHowever, Su Ping had nothing to regret.\nAfter all, it was for his own betterment.\nTo become a powerful Breeder, controlling a vast amount of resources, it’s natural to want to grow more smoothly and rapidly.\nNow that he had managed to secure so many resource channels, strengthening himself and his Pet Beasts was key.\nWith the production of the Heart of the Wolf and the nurturing of the Wanmu Wolf, Su Ping shouldn’t have to worry about money for the time being.\nSo, on this visit, Su Ping had Lin Lei bring him a Spirit Communication Stone. He had been stuck at the Elite Third Rank threshold for a short time, but having enjoyed the rate of breakthroughs before, Su Ping was naturally not content.\nAfter all, for him, breaking through this Realm was tremendously significant!\nIn the morning, he had discussed the Evolution of the Paperman with Vice President Liu. The matter regarding Qian Yi had been weighing heavily on his mind. Qian Yi’s Level had been stuck just above the Common Tenth Level for quite some time now. Though the Paperman’s race limit was surpassed due to its special provenance, exceeding that of an ordinary Paperman, without advancing that last tier to truly reach the pinnacle, Su Ping felt uncertain about studying its Evolution.\nSu Ping wasn’t in a hurry because he knew that, under normal circumstances, someone would come to seek him out.\nSure enough, it wasn’t long before he received a message from Li Shu. It was different from the seriousness of their noon communication:\n[Li Shu: Bro Ping, I was wrong. Please give me another chance to cling to your coattails! /Cry/Cry/Cry]\nSu Ping chuckled.\nIn fact, if there were means, if mere effort could turn one into a prominent figure, Su Ping believed there wouldn’t be many so-called layabouts in this world.\nAnd Su Ping, he merely provided Li Shu with the most precious channels and opportunities.\nAfter all, be it one sheep or two, he had to shepherd them at his base.\nThere were not many people Su Ping could trust, and upon observation, Guan Lili and Li Shu really seemed like the most suitable candidates to come over and help.\n[Su Ping: Make up your mind before you speak. If you run away again, you can just get lost.]\n[Li Shu: Bro Ping, don’t worry. If I run away again, you won’t need to do anything; my dad will definitely break my legs himself.]\n[Su Ping: Alright, then come report in tomorrow.]\n[Li Shu: Boo-hoo, Bro Ping, love you~]\n[Su Ping: Scram.]\nAfter shutting off his phone, Su Ping checked the condition of the Heart of Woods. The Forest Wolf was doing well, and Guan Lili was training it proficientially. Over at the Paperman’s side, Qian Yi seemed to never tire and was still practicing Swordsmanship.\nHaving finished his inspection, Su Ping was satisfied and returned to his room.\nThe Spirit Communication Stone linked with Su Ping’s spiritual power. At this moment, it was as though ripples spread through space itself, as Su Ping’s Spiritual Consciousness entered a vast and clear ocean of the void. This sensation lasted for about ten minutes. Finally, within this blank space, as if triggering a surge of great waves, a spiritual power completely different from Su Ping’s own merged into it.\nAnd in reality, a fine crack appeared on the Spirit Communication Stone in Su Ping’s hand. The next second, it burst with a POP.\nA valuable Commander Level psychic resource had just turned into nothing more than a consumable item. Yet the significance and help it provided were reflected in the gradual enhancement of Su Ping’s Beast Taming Space and his own Realm, which was happening at this very moment. The main manifestations of a Beast Tamer were the Beast Taming Space and their Pet Beasts. As his spiritual understanding deepened, the effects were not merely limited to the Beast Taming Space.\nElite Fourth Rank!\nFrom start to finish, not even half an hour had passed, and Su Ping felt that this threshold, which had long held him back, was easily shattered with the help of the Spirit Communication Stone! More than that, Su Ping could feel that the uplift provided by the stone—which was solely used for enhancing spiritual power—was far from over! His spiritual Realm had also reached a remarkably full level within the Elite Fourth Rank.\nAlthough continuing to break through consecutively wasn’t possible, the extent of the improvement was still astonishingly substantial.\nBut what about his Pet Beasts?\nThinking of that, Su Ping glanced at Xiao Qing. Indeed, Xiao Qing, which had already accumulated a solid foundation, had also improved a Level following the breakthrough feedback from Su Ping!\nElite Third Rank!\nBut what Su Ping cared about most was still the little Paperman, Qian Yi. Xiao Qing’s Minor Realm advancement wasn’t fundamentally significant. However, if the little Paperman, Qian Yi, improved, it would be a leap from Common to Elite Tier. The significance of such a leap in Level could be discerned from Xiao Qing’s previous improvement.\nAnd so it was for Qian Yi.\nAs a Mutated Pet Beast, would there be signs and opportunities for Evolution during this process?\nFull of anticipation, Su Ping didn’t even use a Spiritual Connection to sense it but directly ran towards the Undead Kingdom (basement) where Qian Yi was located.\nAt this very moment, within that basement where the little Paperman Qian Yi was continuously practicing its Swordsmanship, its figure suddenly halted.\n\"WHOA!?\"\nA cry from the little guy echoed. All the Papermen in the basement stopped moving—or rather, those transformed into Sword Devices had never moved in the first place. However, stuck in such monotonous conditions where its only enjoyment was continuously going through those old movie discs—so worn they had a patina—the little Paperman slowly sat down on the ground.\nThe Soul Contract was the most mysterious type of contractual ability. It allowed a Beast Tamer and a Pet Beast to sense each other even across a great distance. It still enabled them to affect each other if something happened to one of them.\nAnd now, that was exactly what was happening.\nSu Ping’s breakthrough was very sudden. But, almost the instant Su Ping completed his breakthrough, the little Paperman had already sensed it, and its own aura was also ascending! The little guy had been stuck at the Common Tenth Level for far too long. This abrupt improvement caused the little Paperman to shake its head, too excited to contain itself.\nA dim light enveloped the little Paperman. The next moment, a burst of Undead energy spread out fiercely. The gathered Papermen, sensing an aura utterly different from theirs, involuntarily reverted from their Sword Device form back to their ordinary Paperman appearance.\nQian Yi paid no attention to them. The little guy stretched out its hand, its form even growing a full size larger. The scattered Papermen couldn’t resist and were directly transformed into Paper Swords in its hands.\nHolding the Paper Sword, Qian Yi suddenly radiated a different kind of light. It thrust the sword with force. That different kind of light flickered along with it. At the same time, this thrust and the light it produced were the first things Su Ping saw upon entering the basement.\nHe knew. That was the glow of a new Skill!\nQian Yi had not only advanced to Elite Tier but also, just like Xiao Qing had comprehended the Poison Flower, had grasped a brand-new Skill!",

      "content": "Chapter 234: Chapter 150: The Mutant Sword Body! The Path of Evolution for the Little Paper Man?\nIn just a short time, the body of the little paper figurine had grown a full size larger than before.\n\"WAAH!\"\nAs the Paper Sword pointed forward, amidst the cries of the little paper figurine, its blade pierced right through both the training dummy and the sturdy wall, leaving a deep mark.\nHowever, Qian Yi hadn’t used the Jinge Technique, and the sharpness of the Paper Sword alone shouldn’t have been enough for such a feat.\nSu Ping didn’t rush to use the Eye of Truth. Instead, he observed the little paper figurine’s movements, gaining an intuitive understanding of Qian Yi’s new skill.\nCompared to the Jinge Technique, this new skill seemed more enduring.\nThe Jinge Technique, when deployed, only imbued a single attack with extreme sharpness. Moreover, the Perfection Level Jinge Technique also made that one sword strike much faster than the release of other skills.\nIt could be considered a trump card, a finishing move type of skill.\nBut now, the skill Qian Yi was currently deploying remained continuous. Although its power was far less than the Perfection Level Jinge Technique, this endurance was more significant.\nMoreover, the newly comprehended skill was evidently only at the Beginner Level.\nSu Ping was already quite satisfied that a skill at this level could possess such power and effect.\nFinally, the light of spiritual power concentrated in Su Ping’s eyes and locked onto Qian Yi, the little paper figurine holding the Paper Sword.\nThe Eye of Truth provided feedback on Qian Yi’s enhancements after his advancement!\n[Mutated Paperman (Contracted)]\n[Attribute: Gold, Undead]\n[Current Level: Elite First Rank]\n[Racial Potential: Elite First Rank]\n[Skills: Paper Body Folding (Proficiency), Jinge Technique (Perfection), Sword Soul Mark (Special), Accelerated Casting (Proficiency), Mutated·Paper Body Control (Proficiency), Mutated·Sword Body (Beginner)]\nSword Body? And it’s a Mutated Skill?!\nSu Ping’s eyebrows lifted slightly.\nMutated Skills were skills that had appeared on other Pet Beasts before, but after mutation, their effects differed from the skill’s normal effects. That was the essence of a Mutated Skill! Take Xiao Qing’s ’Poison Vine Strangulation’, for instance. Strictly speaking, it could be considered a Poison Type mutation of Vine Strangling. However, some Poison Type plant Pet Beasts actually possessed such skills. Compared to those, Xiao Qing’s Poison Vine Strangulation had no real particular uniqueness and, therefore, wouldn’t be considered a Mutated Skill. A Mutated Skill, like the Heart of the Poison Wood, was truly a unique skill belonging to a Pet Beast!\nAnd now, another Mutated Skill had appeared on Qian Yi, the little paper figurine? Another Mutated Skill, just like the previous Paper Body Control. Sword Body?\nThis skill was not unfamiliar to Su Ping. The reason was simple: he had seen it on some Sword Pet Beasts inside the Secret Realm of the Fengdu Sword King. It was a very common skill, even more common for Artifact Pet Beasts that were Sword Devices than the ’Jinge Technique’. Sword Body allowed Artifact Pet Beasts that were Sword Devices to further control and enhance the power of the energy attached to their bodies and the sword itself. Overall, it was a Basic Skill for most Sword-type Pet Beasts. Sword Body and Jinge Technique were the two most abundant skills found on the Rotten Sword in that Secret Realm, and also the most common.\nHowever, from what he had just seen, Su Ping hadn’t really discerned any significant differences between the little paper figurine’s mutated Sword Body and other instances of Sword Body.\nInstantly, the Eye of Truth locked on once more, and the little paper figurine’s skills were clearly displayed before Su Ping’s eyes.\n[Mutated·Sword Body (Beginner): Can enable the body to control energy and attach it to the body and sword, enhancing the power and speed of the sword strikes.\nMutated Effect: Countless practices have led the Paperman to a deeper understanding of the sword. Now, with the integration of energy and the sword, it can comprehend ’Swordsmanship’ skills based on independent thought!]\n(Note: This special skill cannot be improved through practice. It can only be enhanced by comprehending ’Swordsmanship’ skills!)\nWhat?!\nSu Ping stared at the mutated effect of the little paper figurine’s skill.\nCompared to Xiao Qing’s Heart of the Poison Wood, whose mutated effect was merely absorbing Poison Type energy to nourish itself, and Old Sha’s Heart of Woods, whose mutated effect allowed it to transform freely between a wooden form and an animal body, the little paper figurine’s new Mutated Skill once again exceeded Su Ping’s understanding. He had initially thought that the little paper figurine’s mutated Sword Body would also enhance the power of the sword. He never expected the direction of the mutation to be so bizarre. Could it comprehend so-called ’Swordsmanship’ skills through the combination of its own energy and sword techniques?\nSu Ping blinked, remembering the basic swordsmanship movements the little paper figurine had practiced countless times at his behest. Basic moves like thrusting, flicking, and slashing. Could it be that the little paper figurine had comprehended such a special Mutated Skill because of the practice he had initially instructed? Was it due to a fluke, combined with the little paper figurine’s own unique nature, that such a special Mutated Skill was comprehended? Yes! He truly was a Genius Breeder. He had anticipated this situation all along!\nSu Ping paid no attention to the Paperman, still excitedly holding the Paper Sword, and instead sat down on the ground.\nAt that moment, the first thing that came to his mind was, indeed, those martial arts movies.",

      "content": "Chapter 235: Chapter 150: The Mutant Sword Body! The Path of Evolution for the Little Paper Man?_2\nIn the current Beast Master Civilization of this world, this aspect is not widely developed; the primary ability of a Swordsmanship Beast Tamer is considered to be embodied in the sword itself.\nHowever, certain artistic interpretations, as well as works of this kind from his previous life, could offer Su Ping significant inspiration: techniques like the One-Word Electric Sword, Lone Nine Swords, and Evil-Banishing Sword Technique...\nCountless chaotic sword techniques, too numerous to mention.\nDoes this mean Qian Yi, the Paperman’s mutated Sword Body could, through its own comprehension, learn such Swordsmanship and develop actual Skills?\nFor example: Lone Nine Swords Swordsmanship (Beginner)?\nAlthough it feels quite abstract, right now, it really seems to be the case.\nAll of a sudden, Su Ping became extremely excited.\nIf that’s the case, then the potential of this Mutated Skill might be even stronger than all other Mutated Skills he has seen!\nThe fusion of Energy with sword moves, unleashing greater power—that is Swordsmanship!\nTherefore, the extension beyond these sword moves essentially encompasses various styles and techniques of swordplay!\nThen, could ordinary Swordsmanship such as the Chaotic Gust Technique possibly exist? And could those so-called powerful techniques, like the ’Heavenly Sword’ or ’Devastating Divine Calamity’, also be actualized by Paperman?\nIf such ’Swordsmanship’ were to be formed, wouldn’t that constitute a new Super-Rank Skill?!\nAs this idea surfaced, Su Ping once again felt the tingling thrill in his cerebral cortex.\nHe abruptly turned to look at Paperman, who, even after advancing in Level, was still wielding the Paper Swords.\nAnd, could Paperman’s chance for Evolution also be hidden within?\nAs Old Liu said, the essence of Evolution is the ability granted by the rules of this world to all Living Beings other than humans.\nAnd what are the conditions for Evolution? It occurs when the current form cannot meet the demands for further improvement. After all Energy has accumulated to its limit, this brings about a transformation!\nThis requirement is not just reaching the peak of one’s Realm and the limits of one’s Race, but also the so-called ’further improvement’.\nPaperman had previously lacked a path to Evolution because it did not have this ’further improvement’ pathway to ascend.\nHowever, the mutation direction of Mutated Pet Beasts represents an alternative pathway for ascension.\nTo evolve by enhancing its sword aspect?\nPreviously, Su Ping had wanted to focus on Metal Element Cultivation, since Paperman possessed a Metal Element Mutation; this had seemed like a promising direction.\nBut now, his perspective was beginning to shift.\nAlthough the sword, in some sense, belongs to the Metal Element, it is also somewhat distinct.\nSu Ping stepped directly into the training ground.\nPaperman turned its head to look at the approaching Su Ping.\n\"WAH! WAH!\" Qian Yi exclaimed. \"Master! I’ve grown stronger!\"\nSu Ping nodded with a smile, \"But Qian Yi, this is just the beginning. This has laid a foundation for your improvement. The training that follows will be your real test!\"\n\"WAH!\"\nQian Yi clenched its fists.\nSu Ping nodded with satisfaction. He could always find such spirited zeal in Paperman.\nIt was a pity, though, that he still hadn’t found an effective training method for Xiao Qing.\nHowever, there was no doubt that Paperman’s situation was more crucial at the moment.\n\"From now on, you don’t need to continue practicing these fundamental sword moves. Your foundation is already unshakably solid. What is needed now is further advancement.\"\n\"WAH!\"\nSu Ping paused, then continued, \"All fundamental sword moves serve to build a complete Swordsmanship. Next, you need to combine those seemingly ordinary moves into a cohesive and genuine sword technique.\"\n\"WAH?!\"\nPaperman scratched its head; evidently, even after its Level advancement, it still did not fully understand what a complete Swordsmanship entailed.\nSu Ping began to explain in a way that Paperman would understand, \"Those remarkable Swordsmen you’ve seen use sword-derived Skills to defeat their enemies—that’s Swordsmanship!\"\n\"WAH!?\"\nA light gradually dawned in Paperman’s eyes. Then, holding the combined Paper Swords, it closed its eyes.\nBefore Su Ping could react to what this little thing was planning to do, the next moment, Paperman suddenly opened its eyes.\nIt pounced towards the dummy, raised the Paper Swords in its hands, and began to swiftly chop down on the dummy’s body.\nEach strike was forceful and swift, each faster than the last.\nHowever, there was no skill to speak of. The more Su Ping watched, the more lines of exasperation appeared on his forehead.\n\"Stop, stop, stop!\"\nSu Ping halted Paperman’s self-created ’Chaotic Gust Sword Technique’.\nClearly, even though Paperman’s Sword Intent Origin gave it a strong intuitive grasp of Swordsmanship.\nSuch disorderly chopping did not conform to the true essence of Swordsmanship.\nThen, what was the necessary factor in comprehending Swordsmanship?\nSu Ping ignored Paperman’s confused expression and fell into deep thought himself.\nObviously, Paperman’s judgment of Swordsmanship differed from the Low-level techniques mentioned in those martial arts novels.\nIt was about more than just the moves.\nIf it were merely about thrusting with the sword blade and reacting to an opponent’s moves, then calling it Swordsmanship would not only be a stretch, but it also likely wouldn’t possess any lethal power.",

      "content": "Chapter 236: Chapter 150: The Mutant Sword Body! The Path of Evolution for the Little Paper Man?_3\nLooking at that Mutated Sword Body, there’s no doubt it’s an accumulation of energy and sword techniques, which then transforms into Swordsmanship!\nThis means I need to start from the basics! What is the foundation of the Sword Body? It’s the ability to combine energy with the sword. In terms of martial arts novels, this Swordsmanship would be driven by True Qi. Its most important function is to unleash greater power to break through an opponent’s martial skills formed by True Qi, including protective Skills like a True Qi barrier. Or to strike the opponent faster and more decisively. Therefore, to perfect and create a truly new form of Swordsmanship, the first step is to learn to control True Qi! Swordsmanship is an energy-driven attack, where sword moves carry that energy.\nThinking of this, Su Ping patted his head.\n\"Qian Yi, activate the Skill: Sword Body!\"\nQian Yi stretched out his hand, and the assembled Paper Sword once again emitted a faint light. It was extremely faint, but still quite noticeable in the dim basement.\n\"Qian Yi, can you make the Sword Body’s energy burst stronger and more powerful?\"\n\"WOAH?\"\nQian Yi gave Su Ping a strange look. The faint light on the sword vanished, then a brilliant flash erupted as he slashed at the scarred mannequin.\nSu Ping was startled.\nBecause he knew that wasn’t the effect of the Sword Body, but the Jinge Technique! However, on second thought, it made sense. To make the energy burst stronger and more powerful, the Jinge Technique was indeed a Skill that could be referenced!\nImmediately, Su Ping’s eyes lit up.\n\"Qian Yi, can you try to use the principles of the Jinge Technique to activate the Sword Body? Don’t just apply it to the sword; it needs to be within your body. You have to learn to feel the power of the Sword Body and then control its activation!\"\nThe Little Paperman was confused; he didn’t understand what his master meant.\nSo, amidst the Little Paperman’s bewilderment, Su Ping involuntarily pursed his lips again. He thought of those discs and then said, \"The Qi sinks to the Dantian! Circulate the Greater Heavenly Orbit!\"\nAs soon as these words left his mouth, he immediately saw the Little Paperman’s eyes light up.\nThe Little Paperman sat cross-legged on the ground, the Sword Body’s sword energy slowly pulsing around him.\nAt this moment, Su Ping suddenly gained some insight.\nThe principle was actually very simple. For the Little Paperman Qian Yi, the Sword Body Skill was like a predefined instinct. Generally, it was enough for Qian Yi to activate this instinct for combat. The energy consumed per second when activating this Skill, and its power, were actually constant. But this constancy, in itself, actually restricted Qian Yi’s potential. The more energy infused, the better the effect—that was a given. Similarly, the more energy accumulated and compressed, the stronger the resulting force would naturally be—that was also a given. To create a Swordsmanship Skill unique to the Little Paperman by integrating energy and sword moves, freely controlling the energy supply of the Mutated Sword Body was the absolute foundation.\nClearly, once he understood the principle, such control was trivial for the Little Paperman.\nSoon, the light on the Paper Sword in his hands began to flicker. In the dim basement, it resembled a glow stick. It wasn’t just the sword; even his own body pulsed with light.\nSu Ping nodded with satisfaction and recorded all these changes in his notebook.\nThe entire night was spent on such experiments.\nAnd the Little Paperman Qian Yi, truly worthy of being a Sword Soul consciousness born from two Spiritual Level Resources, possessed an incredibly high and potent Talent in this aspect!\nThe Sword Body Skill, it was clear, also belonged to sword-type Skills.\nQian Yi’s speed of mastery was so fast it astounded Su Ping.\nAfter advancing to Elite Fourth Rank, Su Ping’s physical body was further enhanced. Despite not sleeping the entire night, he was still brimming with excitement.\n\"Qian Yi, speed burst!\"\nQian Yi’s figure suddenly shot forward, rocketing from one end of the basement to the other at full power, taking merely three seconds.\nAnd this speed was hardly inferior to the full exertion of an Elite Seventh or Eighth Rank Forest Wolf! Indeed, the Mutated Sword Body didn’t just allow Qian Yi to comprehend his so-called ’own Swordsmanship’! More importantly, it allowed for a more refined control over his own energy. This effect was far more practical than any individual Skill! Of course, the energy consumption was also visibly significant. But Su Ping wasn’t short on money now.\nAfter Qian Yi visibly weakened, Su Ping tossed him two more Recovery Potions specialized for Undead Pet Beasts.\nGULP. GULP.\nQian Yi was once again brimming with energy.\nEvidently, Qian Yi had spent the entire night continuously practicing energy input, compression, and output, striving to meet the standards and requirements set by Su Ping.\nAnd throughout that night, Su Ping was designing the first potential Swordsmanship move for Qian Yi!\nHe had a premonition that the Little Paperman’s Evolution would very likely depend on the Swordsmanship Skills comprehended from the Sword Body as their foundation.\nSo, that night, Su Ping meticulously recalled the countless martial arts novels he had read. He reviewed all the famous Swordsmanship techniques described in them.\nHe discovered that the most basic, most practical, and simplest in principle might actually be a Swordsmanship technique used by some nameless minor character: the One-Word Electric Sword. The technique was simple yet fierce, utilizing explosive speed and concentrating it all into a single strike. With power and swiftness like thunder, it launched the most devastating killing blow! Of course, he didn’t know if this One-Word Electric Sword was truly as he interpreted it. Regardless, it was from this name that he deduced the killing blow of this One-Word Electric Sword. Concentrate on a single point, achieve the pinnacle!\nSo, Su Ping called the Little Paperman to his side.\n\"Qian Yi, are you ready to learn your first Swordsmanship move?\"\n\"WOAH!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 237: Chapter 151 Swordsmanship? Unexpected Pet Beast Evolution!\n\"True Qi, sink! Gather in the legs and the blade, poised and ready to strike like rolling thunder!\"\n\"Unleash the sword!\"\nAs Su Ping’s words fell, the little Paperman struck an eerie pose and sent its sword flying, its speed even greater than before!\nCLANG!\nA clear, ringing sound of the sword, so crisp and pleasant to the ear!\nIf an outsider didn’t know better, they would definitely think Su Ping was watching some absurd martial arts film.\nBut obviously, as far-fetched as it sounded, Su Ping was indeed training a Pet Beast.\nThe problem was, the little Paperman didn’t quite understand technical terms related to Energy, but these overly dramatic martial arts terms were, surprisingly, somewhat comprehensible to it.\nAccompanied by the clear ring, the blade of the Paper Swords directly struck the ’sandbag’ in front of it.\nThe next moment, on a display not far away, a clear line of text appeared:\n[Metal Attribute Skill Attack. Skill Assessment: Sharp Weapon Attack. Pet Beast’s Own Level: Elite Second Rank. Estimated Skill Level: Proficient. Skill Attack Power Intensity: 67]\nIndeed, this was the attack power testing lab from the Breeder Association, which Su Ping had later obtained from Old Liu.\nJudging solely from attacks on a dummy, it was difficult to clearly ascertain a skill’s power. This attack power testing lab undoubtedly solved that problem.\nBut right now, Su Ping had no time to concern himself with these details.\nInstead, he frowned as he looked at the skill attack data displayed above.\nAn entire morning passed.\nAfter Qian Yi had grasped the power generation and Energy utilization techniques taught by Su Ping, forming the first rudimentary version of its swordsmanship, they had remained in this lab.\nHowever, the results were far from satisfying for Su Ping.\nAn attack power of 67.\nFor a Pet Beast of only Elite First Rank, this was already quite remarkable—even exceptional.\nAfter all, the lab’s assessment judged it as the power equivalent to a Proficient Level skill unleashed by an Elite Second Rank Pet Beast.\nBut for Su Ping, this was a failure!\nThe reason was simple: Qian Yi, when using the Jinge Technique against the wooden training dummy, could now achieve an attack power of up to 103!\nThis output, from an Elite First Rank Pet Beast, was comparable to, or even surpassed, the Elite Sixth or Seventh Rank Sand Wolf.\nThat was the power of the Jinge Technique when it reached the Perfect Level.\nAnd now, the power of this rudimentary swordsmanship only exceeded a normal Sword Body attack by about thirty percent.\nGiven the supposed energy compression and speed enhancement, this level of power seemed to be within reasonable expectations.\nBut without a doubt, such an improvement was not enough for the little Paperman to solidify it into its own Swordsmanship skill.\nCould it be, as I suspected, that this task is genuinely too demanding? Does it require an epiphany from Qian Yi, the little Paperman?\nYet, Su Ping was the little Paperman’s Beast Tamer.\nI’ve cultivated powerful Pet Beasts for others. Could it be that when it comes to my own, I’ll fall short?\nSu Ping could not accept such a possibility.\nSo, he fell into deep thought.\n\"WAH!?\"\nQian Yi, noticing Su Ping’s dissatisfaction, seemed a bit frustrated too and scratched its head.\nObserving the little fellow’s demeanor, Su Ping smiled and said, \"Alright, you’ve trained all night. Go and recover. Becoming a powerful Swordsman isn’t achieved overnight; you need to balance exertion and rest!\"\n\"WAH!\"\nThe little Paperman returned to the Undead basement.\nBut whether it continued training or truly rested, Su Ping didn’t know. He wasn’t in the mood to concern himself with that, still pondering the problem at hand.\nWhat was still missing?\nCould it be that Qian Yi simply hasn’t practiced enough? Would more practice be sufficient?\nRegrettably, he couldn’t dwell on it further. He had other tasks to attend to today, including the commitment he’d made yesterday.\n\"Bro Ping, I’m at the entrance of Heart of Woods!\"\nLi Shu’s message came through on his phone. Su Ping gathered his thoughts and stepped out the front door.\nHe saw Li Shu and his father, Li Senlin, whom he had only met the day before.\n\"Su Ping, this young man...\" Li Senlin began somewhat awkwardly. After yesterday’s events, his view of this young man, who was the same age as his own son, had shifted from underestimation to genuine admiration.\nSu Ping, however, simply smiled. \"Uncle Li, please don’t worry!\"\nLi Senlin scratched his head. Meanwhile, Li Shu, standing beside him, gestured for his father to leave. \"Alright, Dad, you should get going. Don’t you have work?\"\nLi Senlin nodded and, after bidding Su Ping farewell, took his leave.\nLeading the unusually subdued Li Shu, who was so quiet he almost seemed like a stranger, Su Ping initiated the conversation with a smile, \"So, have you made up your mind?\"\nLi Shu nodded. \"Bro Ping, I also want to become a Breeder.\"\nSu Ping smiled faintly. \"I’ll be upfront with you. For now, the only Pet Beast I can offer for your practice is the Forest Wolf. Of course, some aquatic Pet Beasts might arrive in a few days, but I don’t have much experience with those. Furthermore, in the future, I might indeed develop some Plant Type Pet Beasts for cultivation...\"\n\"I understand, Bro Ping. I’ll train the Forest Wolf. I’ve made up my mind: if I get the chance to contract a second Pet Beast in the future, I will choose the Forest Wolf!\" Li Shu declared resolutely.\nThe smile on Su Ping’s face didn’t fade as he patted Li Shu’s shoulder.",

      "content": "Chapter 238: Chapter 151 Swordsmanship? Unexpected Pet Beast Evolution!_2\n\"Don’t worry, just keep at it. Elite Level is nothing.\"\nAs Qin Erlong had said, the first three Realms of a Beast Tamer were relatively easy to ascend. However, once one reached Commander Level, each breakthrough became as difficult as reaching the sky.\n\"Okay, follow me.\"\nHaving spent several days at Heart of Woods, Li Shu was quite familiar with the place. With a little guidance from Su Ping, Li Shu had quickly grasped everything.\nBesides, there was the now-mature Guan Lili.\nWith Li Shu and Guan Lili managing the Forest Wolf pack situation, Su Ping really didn’t need to worry too much.\nTherefore, in the following days, he dedicated all his energy to the Cultivation of Qian Yi.\nHe had finally managed to evolve the little Paperman to Elite First Rank, breaking through its previous limits. Furthermore, it had even comprehended a new skill, upon which it could further develop.\nHaving glimpsed such an elusive path of Evolution, giving up halfway wasn’t in Su Ping’s character.\nIn the days that followed, he and the little Paperman Qian Yi spent almost all their time in the Skill Power Testing Laboratory.\nFor an entire week, Su Ping’s life appeared incredibly monotonous to outsiders: just recording the little Paperman’s skill power.\nHowever, the improvement was minimal, almost negligible.\nHe even gave up on the One-Word Electric Sword.\nInstead, he chose to experiment with other rudimentary forms of Swordsmanship, such as the little Paperman’s \"Three Sword Style\" form.\nWith the enhancement of its Sword Body, the \"Three Sword Style\" Paperman was indeed stronger than before, but it still failed to comprehend any Sword Technique Skills through the mutated Sword Body.\nAfter a week, Su Ping even began to doubt his life choices.\nEven the completion of the bridge and the initial emergence of Heart of Water’s lake didn’t capture much of Su Ping’s attention.\nAll his focus was on the great task of the little Paperman’s Cultivation.\nAt night, back in his room, Su Ping continued to pore over the heritage notes of the Fengdu Sword King when, suddenly, the phone rang.\n\"Hello?\"\nSu Ping didn’t even shift his gaze, nor did he check who was calling.\n\"Su Ping, what have you been up to these days? Your dad sends you messages, and you don’t even reply?\"\nSu Anyong’s voice came through the phone.\nSu Ping snapped back to his senses. \"I’ve been a bit busy lately. If you have something to say, just say it!\"\nSu Anyong felt somewhat helpless. In fact, he had called Lao Guan the previous day and knew Su Ping’s current state.\nThese past few days, \"working tirelessly\" was an understatement for his condition.\nGuan Lili, Li Shu, and Guan Qianshan were all profoundly impressed by him.\nOnly with such dedication could Su Ping even have a sliver of a chance to achieve such accomplishments.\nBut this state of neglecting food and rest was genuinely worrying.\nTherefore, Su Anyong, perhaps the only person who could persuade Su Ping, made the call.\n\"Cultivating Pet Beasts isn’t something done overnight. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself, kid.\"\n\"Did Uncle Guan tell you?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"It’s not really about pressure. I just can’t figure something out...\"\n\"Can’t figure out what? Tell me about it...\"\nTruth be told, Su Anyong was indeed the only person Su Ping could share this with.\nThe Paperman was of considerable significance. Without clear results, Su Ping truly couldn’t reveal it to the outside world.\nAlthough his father’s Cultivation ability was rather lacking—if he had put in even a little effort, things wouldn’t have been so dire when Su Ping took over—some matters were indeed better discussed.\nAfter all, Su Ping might indeed be missing a listener right now.\n\"I’ve contracted that mutated Paperman.\"\n\"Hmm!\"\nSu Anyong wasn’t surprised.\n\"Research on the Paperman was also put on the agenda some time ago.\"\n\"Hmm!\"\nSu Anyong nodded.\nSure enough,\nhe thought,\nmy foolish boy has been driven to this state by that Paperman, the shame of the Necromancy System.\n\"Over a month ago, research on the Paperman made a qualitative breakthrough! I discovered a skill lost to history and restored it.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nSu Anyong raised an eyebrow.\nBut Su Ping paid no heed to the slight change in his father’s tone.\n\"Also, the mutated Paperman I contracted subsequently comprehended two mutated Skills: Paper Body Control and Mutated Sword Body! I believe Qian Yi’s chance for Evolution lies within these two Skills, and that Sword Body...\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nSu Anyong was already numb from listening.\nHe had originally thought his son was troubled because of the Paperman’s inherent racial limitations and the apparent lack of hope.\nBut he hadn’t expected—he was simply too naive.\nIs this kid really my flesh and blood?\nSu Anyong’s eyes were filled with utter confusion.\nWhat forgotten Paperman skill from history? What two mutated Skills? What path of Evolution, what self-comprehended Skills? What in the world was all this?\n\"That’s how it is. No matter what I try, Qian Yi just can’t seem to manifest those abilities as Sword Technique Skills...\"\nSu Ping’s voice continued over the phone.\nSu Anyong snapped out of his daze. He thought for a moment and, using his meager knowledge of Cultivation, asked, \"Is the energy consumption unified?\"\nSu Ping nodded. \"Of course. I’ve run countless tests, attempting to unleash the skills’ maximum power based on optimal energy consumption...\"",

      "content": "Chapter 239: Chapter 151 Swordsmanship? Unexpected Pet Beast Evolution!_3\n\"Then... have the activation and corresponding changes of the attribute energy been dealt with?\" Su Anyong scratched his head and asked.\nSu Ping let out a sigh, \"Of course. Qian Yi itself is a Mutated Pet Beast of the Metal Element and Necromancy System, and the energy it stimulates naturally has the sharpness effect of the Metal Element...\"\nWhen Su Ping reached this point, he suddenly paused. Resting his chin on his hand, he was lost in thought, his brow slowly furrowing.\nAt this moment, it seemed like the shadow of something flashed through his mind. But it was still too blurry, preventing him from understanding it clearly at first.\nOn the other end of the phone, Su Anyong, obviously unaware of this, spoke somewhat absurdly, \"Based on what you said, the skill you’re mainly testing utilizes speed and explosive power to unleash the sword’s might. So, what you should need is the energy change of the Thunder Element!\"\n\"...\"\nSu Ping didn’t respond, but his eyes had widened.\nAt that moment, it was as if a flash of lightning had pierced through his mind.\nJust like that sword strike from Qian Yi, which seemed to carry the force of a thousand thunderbolts!\nHowever, it was clear that Su Anyong hadn’t realized any of this and continued to shake his head helplessly, \"But that’s indeed impossible. Your little Mutated Paperman already has both the Necromancy and Metal Elements. It couldn’t possibly consume resources from other elements to experience the energy change of another attribute...\"\nYet, just as his words faded, Su Ping’s voice, unable to contain his excitement, came over the phone, \"No, that’s not right! The Paperman can’t use it, but the sword can! Hahaha, I’ve got it! Dad, thanks, goodbye!\"\nCLICK.\nThe call was hung up.\nSu Anyong stared at the phone emitting a busy signal, even more baffled.\nGot it? What did he get? How come I don’t know what he got? And what on earth is that skill supposedly lost to history?\nHowever, Su Anyong quickly cleared his throat and turned off his phone.\nDo I really have such talent as a Breeder? A casual remark, and Su Ping has an epiphany!\nSu Anyong clicked his tongue, feeling rather pleased with himself.\nPerhaps it was just that I didn’t delve deeply into the path of breeding back then; otherwise, Su Ping, that kid, wouldn’t have even had a chance.\nObviously, Su Ping currently had no mind to concern himself with his dad’s self-congratulation.\nAnd it had to be said, Su Anyong’s words truly gave him the feeling of the clouds parting to reveal the blue sky!\nPreviously, Su Ping hadn’t thought in this direction.\nBecause Qian Yi did possess the attribute’s energy change.\nQian Yi’s energy itself was a coexistence of Gold and Necromancy attributes.\nTherefore, when Qian Yi acted, it inherently possessed the sharpness characteristic of the Metal Element.\nOtherwise, the power of the Paper Swords wouldn’t be so exaggerated.\nHowever, if it were merely so, it obviously wouldn’t meet the requirements for the Sword Technique Skills to take form.\nSu Ping also knew that for explosive speed and power, the Thunder Element was best.\nAnd Qian Yi indeed could no longer absorb Thunder Element resources for replenishment.\nBut just because Qian Yi couldn’t, didn’t mean the swords couldn’t!\nThose were no ordinary swords!\nThey were swords assembled from three Papermen each!\nNow, after two months of nurturing, the levels of these ordinary Papermen had already reached Ordinary Ninth Rank and Common Tenth Level.\nSu Ping had indeed forgotten about this.\nIf there’s no breakthrough with the little Paperman, why not look for one with the swords? After all, isn’t my advantage in this swarm of Pet Beasts? Why should I make the little Paperman give up its greatest advantage for this? The Paperman’s specialty is its ability to integrate from parts into a whole, and also to break down from a whole into parts!\nAt that moment, Su Ping didn’t even feel a hint of sleepiness and immediately sought out Lao Guan, \"Lao Guan, do we have any low-level Thunder Element resources at our base?\"\nLao Guan was taken aback. Watching Su Ping’s excited demeanor, he wondered,\nHow did Su Anyong manage this? Not only did he fail to get the kid to rest, but he even seemed to have given him a shot of adrenaline?\nHe shook his head, \"We don’t use Thunder Element resources here, and the resort doesn’t have any in stock either. But, if you need them, I can order some now.\"\n\"No, that will take too long. I can’t wait that long...\" Su Ping immediately waved his hand.\nThen he called Dong Muyun.\n\"Su Ping!\" Dong Muyun’s voice sounded somewhat delighted.\n\"Are you busy right now? If not, send me some Thunder Element resources quickly. I need them urgently!\"\n\"Thunder Element resources? Okay, what level do you need?\"\n\"The Elite Level will do. It would be best to get more of the Elite Level resource ’Thunder Summoning Paper’!\"\n\"Thunder Summoning Paper? Got it!\"\nDong Muyun was, as always, reliable.\nNot even half an hour had passed before she parked in front of Heart of Woods, seeing Su Ping waiting anxiously at the door, \"Here’s the Thunder Summoning Paper you wanted, and some other Thunder Element resources. What have you been busy with these days?\"\nObviously, the current Su Ping was not in the mood to engage Dong Muyun in idle chat, \"Something’s come up. I’ll tell you about it when I have time!\"\nBefore the last word of his sentence fully left his mouth, Su Ping’s figure had already dashed back into the Heart of Woods base.\nWatching Su Ping disappear, Dong Muyun stomped her foot in annoyance, though she was also curious.\nCould this guy have made another astonishing discovery?\nSu Ping had no time to bother with anyone else. Carrying the resources stored in his Space Ring, he rushed to the Undead basement.\n\"Paper Swords! Disassemble!\"\nAt Su Ping’s command, to Paperman Qian Yi’s astonishment, all the Paper Swords turned back into Papermen.\n\"Abba abba...\"\nLooking at these Papermen that had returned to an incomplete state, Su Ping took a deep breath.\nHe didn’t know what would happen to these Papermen after they used the Thunder Element resources. But at this moment, he couldn’t worry about that. As long as their energy gained the Thunder Element’s attribute change, allowing Qian Yi to perceive it and perfect the skill, the goal would be achieved.\nSo, Su Ping steeled his resolve.\nHe took out three Thunder Summoning Papers and some other low-level Thunder Element resources.\nThis dosage was based on his cultivation experience, designed to allow the Papermen to digest the volatile Thunder Element energy to the greatest extent.\nHe handed them to three Papermen who had reached the highest Ordinary Ninth Rank, and whose Paper Body Joint skill had been upgraded to Mastery Level.\nIn fact, once they reached this level, Su Ping had already planned to attempt the Papermen’s evolution.\nNow was the perfect opportunity.\nThe three Papermen seemed to understand Su Ping’s intent. After consuming a few Ordinary Level, low-level Thunder Element resources, their bodies began to crackle.\nIt was the sound of static electricity!\nThen, they swallowed the ’Thunder Summoning Paper’—an Elite Level Thunder Element resource with which they had the highest compatibility—in one gulp.\nAt that moment, Su Ping didn’t even wait for them to fully digest the Thunder Summoning Paper. After all, even if it was the gentlest Thunder Element resource and the most compatible with Papermen, it was still an Elite Level resource.\nIf any problems arose, he would be helpless.\nSo, seizing the moment, Su Ping decisively issued their most familiar command to the three Papermen, \"Paper Swords! Merge!\"\nPaperman Qian Yi watched the scene unfold before him, not understanding why.\nHowever, the three Papermen, whose bodies had begun to emit white electric flashes and crackling lightning, still subconsciously obeyed Su Ping’s commands.\nThe blade! The sword core! The hilt!\nThe three components, flickering with electrical light, completed their respective transformations.\nThen, with a sound like gears and clockwork springs meshing, the assembly was complete.\nA Paper Sword, flickering with electric arcs and lightning, appeared in Su Ping’s field of view.\nAnd at that very moment, even before Su Ping could react, a blinding light instantly illuminated the entire Undead basement!\nThis light was so dazzling, clearly reflecting Su Ping’s dumbfounded expression and gaze.\nSu Ping had seen such a light once before.\nIt was when Old Sha evolved from Forest Wolf into Wanmu Wolf.\nIn other words, due to this series of coincidences, these ordinary Papermen had begun to evolve!\nThe Paperman, disparaged by countless Breeders—including Senior Undead Breeders and even some masters—was evolving! It was known as the shame of the Necromancy System. Apart from the worthless Armor Paperman, it was considered a trash-tier Pet Beast with no room or potential for evolution whatsoever!",

      "content": "Chapter 240: Chapter 152: The Lightning Paperman! The Lonely Blade!\nBefore, Su Ping certainly had a premonition, but he never expected this step would come so quickly.\nAs for the Evolution of Paperman, Su Ping had done some research.\nUndoubtedly, the key point lies in the Paper Body Joint technique.\nSo, for such a long time, the nurturing of resources in the Necromancy Series had never ceased, and the Level advancement of Paperman, especially the meticulous sharing of connections via the Paper Body Joint skill, was scrupulously maintained. For this purpose, he had even specially increased the cultivation of some Papermen.\nThe three here now were the original three, whose Level had reached ordinary Level 10. Coupled with a Master Level Paper Body Joint, they had also already reached the limit for a Paperman creature.\nBut, Su Ping really didn’t expect that upon reaching this limit, the Evolution of Paperman would turn out to be so simple.\nWas it his own lucky blunder? Or did Paperman inherently have an affinity for the Thunder Element?\nOr perhaps, after reaching this Level, the Evolution of Paperman was naturally easygoing?\nSu Ping didn’t know; all he could do was stand dumbfounded alongside the small Paperman Qian Yi, staring at what was before them.\nThe little Paperman was even more stupefied.\nIt hadn’t evolved, but its sword had?\nWho the hell could it even talk to about this?\nYet, the fact was unfolding right before their eyes.\nThe Evolution of a Pet Beast didn’t last long. Especially for a Paperman of a lower Rank, its Evolution was not particularly high-level among special Pet Beasts.\nCompared to Old Sha’s Light of Evolution, which lasted close to an hour, the light of this Evolution didn’t even persist for ten minutes.\nThe glow of Evolution gradually faded away.\nEvolution is one of the basic rules of this world. It could accelerate a creature’s development—a process that might normally take thousands, if not tens of thousands, of years—all due to an overflow of Energy. It was simply astonishing.\nAccompanied by Su Ping’s amazement, the light completely disappeared.\nFinally, the three Papermen that had completed their Evolution appeared clearly before Su Ping’s eyes.\nAt a glance, they seemed unchanged?\nThey were still Paper Swords, except now, their color was somewhat dimmer. The previous Paper Swords were extremely pale, similar to the whiteness of Paperman’s body. After the Evolution, the Paper Swords had a silver-gray metallic sheen, and at first glance, one could no longer discern that they were made of paper.\nMoreover, along the blade, streaks of blue-white lightning occasionally flickered.\nHad they truly evolved into Thunder Swords?\nSu Ping blinked, and this time, unable to wait, he used the Eye of Truth and analyzed the special state of the three evolved Papermen in front of him:\n[Paperman·Thunder (Wild) (3×1 Paper Sword·Thunder Form)]\n[Attribute: Undead, Thunder]\n[Current Level: Elite Third Rank]\n[Racial Potential: Elite Tenth Stage]\n[Skills: Paper Body Folding (Proficient), Paper Body Joint·Thunder (Proficient), Paper Body Compression (Beginner), Paralysis Spell (Beginner), Thunder Strike (Exclusive Skill for Paper Sword·Thunder Form)]\nPaperman·Thunder? Isn’t this name a bit too simplistic? Compared to Forest Wolf and Wanmu Wolf, it’s worlds apart.\nJust by adding a suffix to Paperman and that’s it?\nWas it because the changes in the Evolution itself weren’t significant?\nSu Ping wasted no time and looked at the three new skills of this newly-evolved Thunder Paperman.\n[Paper Body Compression (Beginner): Can compress its own paper body to enhance its mass and reduce its size.]\nA very common Racial Skill, but with great potential.\n[Paralysis Spell (Beginner): A basic Thunder Element skill, can paralyze an enemy using the power of thunder.]\nJust as described, a very basic skill ability.\nAnd undoubtedly, among the three skills, the most crucial one was the last.\n[Thunder Strike (Exclusive Skill for Paper Sword·Thunder Form): Special Skill, can only be used by Paperman·Thunder in Paper Sword Form, concentrating the power of three Papermen to unleash a powerful thunderous blow.]\n(Note: This skill Level cannot be improved and is determined by the Level of Paperman·Thunder’s ’Paralysis Spell’.)\nGenerally speaking, among Pet Beast skills, with every major breakthrough in their race limit, roughly equivalent to a Great Realm, the number of acquired Racial Skills increases by one or two. However, Paperman·Thunder, with its four Racial Skills, had acquired yet another new skill upon merging into Paper Sword·Thunder Form.\nForm-based skills? Interesting! Could the skills change with a different form?\nIs this the potential of Paperman?\n\"Wait a minute.\" Su Ping suddenly raised his eyebrows. Looking at the Paperman·Thunder’s skills, he thought,\nthe original Paper Body Joint seemed to have undergone some changes?\n[Paper Body Joint·Thunder (Proficient): One of the core techniques exclusive to Paperman, to be used in conjunction with ’Paper Body Folding’! Can complete joining with other Papermen, with effects including Level enhancement, soul completion, Energy resonance, and more.\nHaving acquired Thunder Element attribute changes, joining with other Papermen of the same attribute yields greater effects. However, joining with Papermen of different attributes recklessly can result in uncontrollable and unpredictable consequences!\nCurrently mastered form: Paper Sword·Thunder (Elite) (Requires: 3 Papermen·Thunder)]\nSure enough.\nPreviously, the form mastered by this Paper Body Joint was: Paper Swords (Ordinary).",

      "content": "Chapter 241: Chapter 152: The Lightning Paperman! The Lonely Sword!_2\nThe current form had become Paper Sword・Thunder (Elite).\nSpeaking of which, will there be Paper Sword・Fire (Elite) and Paper Sword・Wind (Elite) in the future?\nSu Ping wondered.\nWill the Paper Sword change and differ based on the attributes of the evolved Paperman after assembly? If I continue to develop other assembly forms based on the Paperman’s shape, will the level cap for these forms also be raised? Like ’Thunder Summoning Sword (Commander)’? Or even something like ’Thunder Commanding Sword (Monarch)’? It’s not impossible!\nAt this moment, Su Ping had a clearer understanding of the Paperman’s potential.\nIt truly deserves the recognition of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas—a special Pet Beast with tremendous potential!\nSo, what is the foundation that affects the level cap of the assembly forms? Is it the Level of a single Paperman? Or is it the number of Papermen needed for the combined form? Both are possible!\nBefore Su Ping could think any further, the ’Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas,’ which had been quiet for a long time, reacted at this very moment, just as he’d expected.\nThe blue LV2 Illustrated Handbook entry for the Paperman slowly appeared in Su Ping’s mind.\nA new entry appeared in the log:\n[Origami Man Record has logged an evolutionary form catalog branch: Paperman: Thunder Form Evolutionary Body. Gained Experience Points: 200!]\n[You can enter the Origami Man Record to further inspect the ’Paperman: Thunder’ form analysis.]\n[The Paperman: Thunder form is a branch of the Paperman form Evolution Chart; thus, the Paperman: Thunder Form Catalog has no level Experience Points. Experience Points gained from this form will be credited back to the Origami Man Record!]\n[Interacting with three Paper Sword・Thunder daily for a certain amount of time will earn Origami Man Record Experience +10×3.]\nOnly 200 Experience Points. This didn’t surprise Su Ping much; after all, the Level of this Thunder Element Paperman was indeed too low.\nThe rest was just as it had been when Old Sha evolved. The evolution of the Thunder Element Paperman would still continue to affect the Origami Man Record itself.\nWith a thought, Su Ping confirmed it. Indeed, at the top of the Origami Man Record, below the entry ’Special Cultivation, Evolution,’ a new annotation appeared.\nUnlocked Evolutionary Forms:\n[Branch Catalog: Paperman: Thunder]\n[Paperman: Thunder: A Paperman that has undergone normal Thunder Element enhancement. Its upper limit has increased to a certain extent, and the strength of its assembled form after assembly has also been greatly improved! Possesses Racial Skills: Paper Body Folding, Paper Body Joint・Thunder, Paper Body Compression, Paralysis Spell.]\nJust then, \"WOOAH!\"\nThe little Paperman, looking at the Paper Sword shimmering with lightning, finally couldn’t contain his excitement!\nAlthough it was a bit disappointing that he hadn’t completed his own evolution while the sword did, at least his strength seemed to be enhanced, right?\nSu Ping also snapped back to reality and looked at the little Paperman.\nThe Paperman’s evolution is an unexpected joy,\nhe mused. However, compared to the Wanmu Wolf, the key to the Paperman’s evolution still lay with Qian Yi. The main reason for studying Papermen was, after all, to help Qian Yi achieve his Evolution!\nAt Su Ping’s signal, Qian Yi reached out and finally grasped the Paper Sword・Thunder!\nInstantly, dazzling lightning spread from the blade all over Qian Yi’s body.\n\"WOOAH!\" the little Paperman cried out in exaggerated pain. His two-dimensional face, clearly numb from the electric shock, contorted into an expression of tearful agony.\nBut soon, the little Paperman’s two-dimensional face changed again. \"WOOAH!?\nIs this the power of thunder and lightning!?\n\"\nHis previously numb body actually stood up straight again, and he struck a heroic pose, brandishing the sword as if ready for battle.\nBut soon, the little Paperman’s face changed yet again!\nThe face of an Ace of Spades appeared, seeming to signify that the little Paperman had entered his most serious state.\nSerious Qian Yi.\nSu Ping watched this little guy intently.\nAs expected! My guess was correct!\nThe little Paperman’s Mutated Skill, Paper Body Control, allowed him to control all Papermen he came into contact with. In other words, this was, in a sense, another form of Paper Body Joint. However, the Paper Body Joint of other Papermen was literal, requiring them to piece themselves together with other Papermen.\nBut Qian Yi was different. Qian Yi possessed complete self-awareness and a soul, so he didn’t need to piece together with any other Papermen to perfect his soul. Because he already had the most complete soul, Qian Yi could control other Papermen! This control surpassed the mere concept of assembly!\nPerhaps a sword held in a swordsman’s hand is also a form of assembly?\nSu Ping thought.\nTherefore, even if his own attributes differed, after the Papermen were imbued with Thunder Element power, Qian Yi could naturally still master that power!\nHowever, Su Ping’s deeper thoughts went beyond merely controlling the Paper Sword itself. What he was wondering at that moment was whether Qian Yi, after grasping the Paper Sword・Thunder, could control the Thunder Element power within it!\nIf he could, that would be heaven-defying!\nSu Ping’s eyes narrowed as he looked at the little Paperman before him.\nAt this moment, the little Paperman didn’t need Su Ping’s command; his aura slowly condensed. Lightning coiled around the long sword in his hand, and the silver-gray blade emitted a crackling sound.\nIt turned out that although the Swordsman’s ’poker face’ was truly abstract, the little Paperman, his face now an ’A’, was always the most trustworthy. He stood there in the gloomy basement, which in that instant seemed to have transformed completely into his domain.\nQian Yi’s attention was entirely focused on the tempered steel dummy in the distance. Even after practicing for so long, despite the little Paperman’s relentless slashing day and night, the dummy still stood firm.\nHis True Qi sank, settling in his legs and the sword blade, poised to erupt like a thunderclap!\nFinally, the little Paperman, like a leopard about to pounce, assumed his sword stance—a posture he had practiced countless times over the past week. But this time, it was clearly different from any before.\nThe little Paperman sensed and comprehended the changes in the Thunder Attribute energy.\nThe legacy of the Fengdu Sword King was correct—a Sword Soul born from the Sword Intent Origin combined with a Soul Tomb possessed absolute Talent for anything related to swordsmanship. So, sensing and merging with the changes of the Thunder Attribute in a mere dozen seconds or so—was that also possible?\nThus, in that instant of readiness, a moment Su Ping hadn’t anticipated, Qian Yi moved!\n’BOOM!’\nIt was as if thunder had exploded right beside Su Ping’s ears!\nWas that thunder? Perhaps. But Su Ping wasn’t sure, as there was another possibility: the sonic boom from an incredible burst of speed! Too fast!\nEven as Su Ping reacted, he only saw an afterimage of lightning streaking out! Accompanying it was that all-too-familiar clang of the sword, a sound he had grown rather tired of hearing!\nAt the limit of his vision, the lightning-wreathed Paper Sword・Thunder was still clutched in Qian Yi’s hand. Only, the lightning flickering upon it seemed much dimmer.\nThe next moment, Qian Yi executed a flourish and sheathed the long sword—the Paper Sword・Thunder—back into its scabbard. The little Paperman, his back to Su Ping, maintained the sword-sheathing posture.\nThen, the tempered steel dummy emitted a grating CRACK.\nBefore Su Ping’s eyes, the head of the incredibly tough dummy slowly separated from its neck and slid to the ground! The cut was as smooth as a mirror, as if what had been severed wasn’t a tempered steel dummy capable of withstanding blows from elite high-tiered Pet Beasts, but an ordinary wooden one.\n\"WOOAH...\nSo this is my first true sword strike...\n\"\nAt some point, Qian Yi, at the limit of Su Ping’s vision, slowly straightened up. He adjusted his paper conical hat and, with a touch of ’melancholy,’ lamented with that familiar phrase, \"WOOAH...\nThis sword strike... how lonely it is...\n\"",

The Interlayer of the Sword King’s Legacy!\n[Gold, Thunder Attribute Skill Attack, Skill Judged as: Sharp Weapon Attack (Paperman), Pet Beast’s own Level: Elite First Rank, Estimated Skill Level: Perfection Level, Skill Attack Power: 139]\n139!\nIn the laboratory, even though Su Ping had prepared himself, at this moment, he still couldn’t help but inhale sharply.\nThis attack power was already comparable to a Sand Wolf that had consumed Heart of the Wolf and an energy burst potion.\nIn other words, the power of this skill had reached the attack force of an Elite Peak.\nHowever, this was merely the collective power unleashed by four Elite First Rank Papermen.\nIndeed, after completing its Evolution, the Paperman - Thunder, when disassembled, was composed of Elite First Rank units.\nHowever, upon merging into the Paper Sword - Thunder, its Level rose to Elite Third Rank.\nAnd this sword, when wielded by Qian Yi, unleashed an attack with power approaching the Elite Peak!\nThe Papermen’s assembly and combination unleashed power that surpassed the limitations of their own Realm.\n[One-Word Electric Sword (Proficient): Combining the explosive power of the Thunder Element with the sharpness of a sword, it can unleash immense destructive power and burst speed in an instant! One of the Swordsmanship techniques Qian Yi created, belonging to his ’Ace of Spades’ series of Swordsmanship!]\nIndeed, when the little Paperman finally grasped the Sword of Thunder, the One-Word Electric Sword, which it had practiced for a full week, finally came to fruition.\nThe only thing that gave Su Ping a headache was that this Special Skill, entirely self-created by the little Paperman—a skill that, to his knowledge, had not appeared in other Pet Beasts—seemed to have its description in the Eye of Truth altered by the Paperman’s own will.\nGod damn it, the ’Ace of Spades’ series of Swordsmanship!\nHowever, Su Ping suddenly recalled that the last time the little Paperman Qian Yi entered the Three Sword Style state, it was a similar situation.\nThis little guy wouldn’t be planning to categorize all his comprehended Swordsmanship techniques with playing cards, would he?\nIt wouldn’t matter much now when no one was around. However, the mere thought of this little guy turning into a giant poker face during Pet Beast combat in an arena in the future made Su Ping break out in a cold sweat.\nWhat if he used that poker face to look up and spout some bizarre phrases?\nEnvisioning such a scene, Su Ping cringed so intensely his toes felt like they were trying to dig a hole in the floor.\nAt this moment, he was filled with regret, wondering why he ever tried to show the little Paperman martial arts films? Why inform him about the carefree and lonely life of a Swordsman?\nClearly, watching the enraptured, heavenward-gazing little Paperman, Su Ping knew it was already too late.\nWay too late!\nIt’s just like raising a child; if you don’t educate them properly when they’re young, no matter how hard you try later on, it’s very hard to change them.\nHe was filled with immense regret!\nHowever, as Su Ping looked on in desperate frustration, suddenly, a light began to shine from the blissful little Paperman.\nBut the light was just a fleeting glow that vanished in an instant.\nSu Ping blinked, puzzled. If it wasn’t for the fact that he had been working around the clock recently, and then stayed up all night because of the Paperman Evolution, along with Qian Yi’s mastery of Swordsmanship, causing his eyes to be blurry, then that light just now...\nWas that the Light of Evolution? The same Light of Evolution he had seen just last night?\nHowever, unlike the Paperman’s direct Evolution, the light on Qian Yi had merely flashed for a moment before disappearing.\nWhat did that signify?\nSu Ping held his breath.\nBecause he knew he had guessed correctly.\nThe Evolution of a Mutated Pet Beast could not be judged by the standards of a normal Pet Beast’s Evolution.\nHigh risk, high reward.\nOld Liu’s words still echoed in his ears.\nThis was because with Mutated Pet Beasts, one couldn’t attempt Evolution using the methods of their original Race.\nThey could only rely on their Breeder’s knowledge for experimentation.\nHowever, now that the little Paperman had advanced alongside Su Ping’s own Level-up and comprehended the mutated Sword Body, Su Ping was certain.\nThe Paperman’s Evolution had to be related to ’Paper Body Control’ and ’Sword Body.’\nWhat Su Ping hadn’t expected, however, was for signs to emerge so quickly.\nYes, that was definitely the Light of Evolution!\nBreeder’s knowledge explained such phenomena: a Pet Beast that had met some evolutionary requirements, with its Energy at its peak and thus on the verge of Evolution, might sometimes unconsciously emit this Light of Evolution.\nHowever, because some conditions were still unmet, it couldn’t complete the final Evolution.\nPreviously, Old Sha, during his final power accumulation, and several other Wanmu Wolves had occasionally shown flashes of the Light of Evolution during the final stages of their Cultivation!\nSo, after Qian Yi comprehended the One-Word Electric Sword, causing the mutated ’Sword Body’ to reach the Proficient Level for the first time through Swordsmanship comprehension, had he already met some of the requirements for Evolution? Was he on the brink of Evolution?\nThen, what was Qian Yi lacking now? Was it evolutionary Energy? Or the comprehension of other Swordsmanship techniques?\nSu Ping didn’t know. He only knew that from his perspective, these seemed to be the only two possibilities.",

      "content": "Chapter 243: Chapter 153: The Lightning Sword with a Single Stroke! The Interlayer of the Sword King’s Legacy!_2\nSwordsmanship comprehension could continue, and the accumulation of Evolution Energy could be enhanced using resources!\nWithout a doubt, Su Ping’s Contracted Beast seemed to have finally, truly, touched the edge of evolution. The significance of this was self-evident. The most significant difference was that Su Ping might not only be a Breeder in the future but also a true, combat-capable Beast Tamer!\nThinking of this, Su Ping looked towards the little fellow who was still reveling in his self-satisfaction.\n\"Qian Yi, the comprehension of swordsmanship is for dealing with all kinds of possible combat situations. The One-Word Electric Sword is just the beginning, certainly not the end! Are you ready for the second swordsmanship technique?\"\n\"WAH!\"\nThe little Paperman was brimming with confidence. Clearly, having completed the comprehension of the One-Word Electric Sword, the little Paperman not only achieved a deeper understanding of himself but also of the sword in his hands. Some energy conversions that he couldn’t complete on his own could now be done through the sword. After all, if Heart of Woods had nothing else, it certainly had plenty of swords. The number of Papermen that could combine to form sword shapes was even greater.\nSo, the little Paperman patted his chest confidently. As long as there were swords, and as long as ’Master’ could make them, he would have no problem.\nHowever, the One-Word Electric Sword had been Su Ping’s experiment. In such a short time, he really couldn’t think of any other swordsmanship techniques to create. Thus, as the master, Su Ping decisively delegated this responsibility to the little Paperman.\n\"Qian Yi! A true Swordsman also needs to create his own swordsmanship techniques! Do you understand?!\"\nQian Yi blinked. \"WAH? Create my own?\"\nHe then nodded resolutely. \"WAH! I understand!\"\n「...」\nQian Yi returned to the necromancy basement to practice his so-called self-created swordsmanship, and Su Ping also began his preparations. He needed to prepare Necromancy System and Metal Element resources, from Elite to Commander Level—three of each type and for each level. Furthermore, to avoid any special circumstances, Su Ping had even exchanged for a Monarch Level Necromancy System resource from the Legion: the ’Frozen Soul Flame’. This was a precaution.\nBesides this, Su Ping looked once more at the legacy of the Fengdu Sword King. Dong Muyun had initially given it to him after he was blasted out of the Secret Realm; Dong Muyun himself had received it as a gift to be passed on. From the outside, this item was a sword-shaped pendant, but in reality, there was a small space inside. This small space held the knowledge legacy of the Fengdu Sword King.\nPreviously, Su Ping would occasionally look at this legacy, but only in his free time. Because the books of the Sword King’s legacy were made of sheepskin parchment, they were quite troublesome to handle, so his reading progress was not fast. However, these past few days, because of its connection to swords and the little Paperman, Su Ping had been studying it closely. Once he started, he found it hard to stop.\nThis was normal. After all, it was a notebook left by an ancient Beast Tamer who had reached the pinnacle of the Emperor Level. Containing the entire life’s work of an Emperor Peak Level Beast Tamer, it wouldn’t make sense if it were simple.\nThe idea of blindly revering antiquity was inadvisable in the era of Beast Tamers. The development of Pet Beasts was ever-changing; modern Beast Tamers were not necessarily stronger than those of ancient times, but they were definitely not weaker.\nTherefore, Su Ping acknowledged some parts of this Fengdu Sword King’s legacy notebook, while others he didn’t care much for. After all, it was primarily a record of experiences and some Sword Device Cultivation and training methods. However, it lacked the most important thing!\nAs the Spirit of the Secret Realm had said, the Fengdu Sword King’s two truly secret Sword Device evolution methods—the ordinary Rotten Sword evolving into the Commander Peak Immortal White Bone Sword, and the Emperor Peak Extinguishing Spirit Yama Sword—had both been offered to some Glazed Saint Master. They would never again be imparted to others.\nWithout these Secret Techniques for Cultivation and evolution, this notebook naturally only had referential value. Having read it all in one go, Su Ping’s understanding of Sword Device Cultivation had undergone an earth-shattering transformation.\nAlthough he didn’t possess any Sword Artifact Pet Beasts, nor did he plan on contracting one, he had Paperman and now Qian Yi! The ’Paper Swords • Thunder’ form the Paperman had evolved into this time made Su Ping realize just how tremendous its evolutionary potential was!\nSo, could he use the Cultivation and evolution methods for Instrument Type Pet Beasts to combine with the swords formed by the Paperman?\nIt had to be said, this was indeed quite possible! The Paperman was too flexible! If it was just a matter of forming a sword, then he could cultivate it according to its corresponding parts. He could use Sword Device experience to cultivate the Paperman!\nIt was a pity that although Su Ping now possessed a wealth of experiential theory, he lacked a genuine Sword Device evolution Cultivation method to experiment with, even indirectly.\nPicking up the parchment, Su Ping was about to return it to the cabinet. However, Su Ping’s eyebrows soon furrowed. The last page of the parchment book was blank.\nAlthough Su Ping was puzzled as to why the Fengdu Sword King would leave the last page blank, he still respected the Sword King. Even though he had ultimately parted on bad terms with the Sword King’s Sword Spirit, Su Ping still respected the Sword King. He resolved that if an opportunity arose in the future, he would try to fulfill the Fengdu Sword King’s final wish.",

The last page not only felt much harder, but it was also significantly heavier.\nSu Ping’s eyes held a strange look.\nDid ancient Beast Tamers all like to play these little tricks? So, this ’secret technique’ in the last page’s interlayer... was it supposed to be soaked in water, heated by fire, or was there some other method?\nSu Ping didn’t attempt any of those. Instead, he took it directly to the laboratory. The superconducting sonic detector took only a moment to analyze the material of the final parchment page.\nSu Ping clicked his tongue and shook his head, then looked at the analysis results:\n[Flowing Firefly Parchment, thick parchment double-layered; the top layer must be peeled back and placed under fluorescent or ultraviolet light to reveal the lingering text.]\nJust as I expected! This is the power of technology!\nSu Ping did as instructed. Subsequently, a sheepskin letter appeared in his hands.\nUnder the illumination of the ultraviolet lamp, the text inside was clearly revealed:\n[Method for Cultivating the Immortal White Bone Sword:...]\n[Method for Cultivating the Extinguishing Spirit Yama Sword:...]\nSu Ping smiled.\nJust as I expected. When someone is on the brink of death, what good are oaths? \"Never to be passed on?\" This was a cultivation method researched by the Fengdu Sword King himself. If the Glazed Saint Master hadn’t continued the legacy, or if some accident had occurred, wouldn’t the lifelong efforts of the Fengdu Sword King have been completely wasted, lost to history? Clearly, no one would accept such an outcome. Thus, it was only natural for the Fengdu Sword King to leave behind some tricks in the end. This was likely unknown even to the Secret Realm Sword Spirit.\nHowever, aside from the evolution and cultivation of these two Sword Devices, there were also some genuine last words left by the Fengdu Sword King:\n\"This is the culmination of my life’s work; I cannot bear to see it lost in solitude. If someone destined finds it, pass it on! Then, I shall die without regrets.\"\n\"The Sword Soul was some foolish wishful thinking in my final years. Whether it succeeds or fails, I have no regrets.\"\n\"I leave the legacy within the Heavenly Tomb Sword Seal, in hopes that future generations will not forget my name, Yu Liangqing, the Fengdu Sword King!\"\n\"Alas, I was ultimately unable to reach the divine realm, extend my life further, and slay the Ghost Gods of the Heavenly Tomb... What a pity.\"\nReading the last words of the Fengdu Sword King, Su Ping couldn’t help but shake his head with a sense of helplessness.\nEven a Beast Tamer who had reached Emperor Level would one day return to dust. How high must a Beast Tamer’s Realm be to truly achieve immortality?\nSu Ping didn’t know, nor was he inclined to dwell on it. Instead, he focused his attention on the Fengdu Sword King’s words.\nThe Heavenly Tomb Sword Seal?\nSu Ping picked up the sword-shaped pendant hanging around his neck.\nThis piece of junk actually has a name? Isn’t it just a common spatial item? In modern society, spatial items aren’t particularly rare because some companies specialize in making them. Among the products produced by space-related Pet Beasts, the Space Ring is the most widely used. Could this thing have been rare in ancient times?\nSu Ping scratched his head.\nAnd what about this final mention of ’slaying the Ghost Gods of the Heavenly Tomb’? Connecting the dots, the answer wasn’t hard to guess. It was likely that hundreds of years ago, during the Liang Dynasty, there was a place called the Heavenly Tomb, home to many Undead Ferocious Beasts. It’s somewhat similar to some of the remaining human restricted areas today, where Ferocious Beasts lurk. However, there had been no mention of it in recent years; evidently, it must have been wiped out. This Heavenly Tomb Sword Seal was likely a resource from that place.\nHe wore the sword-shaped pendant purely because he liked its appearance and it also functioned as spatial equipment.\nSu Ping shook his head, not wanting to overthink it. Compared to this so-called Heavenly Tomb, Su Ping was more interested in the cultivation methods for the two unique Sword Devices mentioned above.\nThe Immortal White Bone Sword. It was an Evolutionary Body of the Rotten Sword, an Elite Level Racial Potential Artifact Pet Beast. It was a Peak Command Evolutionary Body, cultivated from at least an Elite Level Skeleton Warrior and supplemented by a series of resources.\nI’m not the same Su Ping as before; such Evolutionary Bodies seem relatively ordinary to me now. The final evolutionary potential only increased by one Great Realm. If it weren’t for the subsequent Second Stage Evolution that directly reached the Emperor Peak Extinguishing Spirit Yama Sword, I might have glanced at it once and then paid it no further attention.\nThe Extinguishing Spirit Yama Sword... now this Evolutionary Body is truly intriguing. An Artifact Pet Beast capable of directly slaying those of the Necromancy System, with significant damage enhancement against Ghost Soul types of the Necromancy System, was extremely rare. Therefore, discovering this evolutionary cultivation method is of great interest to me. The evolution of the Extinguishing Spirit Yama Sword is also fascinating. There’s no need to elaborate on the plethora of evolution steps and required resources. The final evolution, however, has a particularly special standard: it required slaying a certain number of Undead Pet Beasts, and even needing to slay Monarch Level Undead Pet Beasts of a higher rank! Evolution that actually required killing...\nUndoubtedly, this once again gave me an eye-opening discovery. The evolution of Pet Beasts in the Beast Tamer world can take on all sorts of possibilities, including the Paperman’s Paper Body Joint. If I didn’t have the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, who would have imagined that the Paperman, which showed no signs of any evolutionary trigger, would evolve in such a way?",

The Interlayer of the Sword King’s Legacy!_4\nThe Immortal White Bone Sword’s evolution through slaughter might have been like that as well,\nSu Ping mused.\nIt’s just unknown how that Fengdu Sword King, Yu Liangqing, managed to pull off such high-level kills.\nJust thinking about it, Su Ping could envision an intense and thrilling scene in his mind.\nUnfortunately, as soon as this image appeared, it was shattered by the last few words of the method for evolving the Extinguishing Spirit Yama Sword:\n[It’s recommended that the other Pet Beasts are elevated to Monarch Level, or to seek help from a Monarch Beast Tamer to capture Monarch-level Deadly Beasts so that they could be slain with the Immortal White Bone Sword...]\n\"Damn it, although it’s realistic, it’s really not romantic at all!\" Su Ping couldn’t help but grouse.\nHowever, just at this moment, the ever-active Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas suddenly stirred again.\nIt wasn’t on any specific Catalog, but a message appeared directly in Su Ping’s mind:\n[Obtained the Cultivation method for the ’Rotten Sword’s’ Evolutionary Body ’Immortal White Bone Sword’, and its Second-stage Evolution ’Extinguishing Spirit Yama Sword’.]\n[’Rotten Sword’ Catalog has not been activated; unable to further perfect and complete its Cultivation Evolution method!]\nHmm?\nSu Ping frowned slightly and shook his head in frustration.\nWithout the Catalog being lit, even with the evolution method, there are no Experience Points to improve further. This is, indeed, to be expected.\nHowever, just as Su Ping was about to filter out this message, the Catalog for the Paperman lit up on the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas!\n[Detected a special Evolutionary Body, ’Immortal White Bone Sword’; and its Second-stage Evolution, ’Extinguishing Spirit Yama Sword’. The evolution method is related to its compatibility with the Paperman’s Paper Sword Form.]\n[Can consume Paperman Record Experience Points to deduce the evolution method for this Evolutionary Body. Each attempt costs 100 Experience Points! With each failure, the chance of success for the next attempt increases.]\n[Your own research can also speed up the success rate of deduction.]\nSu Ping scratched his head.\nDid the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas have this effect too? But it must be said, the Paper Sword Form of the Paperman and this type of Sword Device Pet Beast indeed share a similar ingenious mechanism. In that case, should he give it a try?\nSu Ping wasn’t the type to be indecisive or deliberately make things harder for himself.\nIf he could use the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas to \"cheat\" directly, why would he waste time researching? Was he soft in the head? Wouldn’t it be better to spend that time researching something the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas couldn’t help him \"cheat\" with?\nSo, Su Ping licked the corner of his mouth.\nA hundred Experience Points per attempt doesn’t seem like much, does it?\nHe glanced at the Experience Points of the Paperman Record again: LV2 (1,451/2,000).\nOver a thousand Experience Points,\nhe thought.\nCompared to the Forest Wolf, leveling up the Paperman Record isn’t that urgent. LV3 Mind’s Eye isn’t particularly necessary for the Paperman either. Since Qian Yi controls the Paperman, it doesn’t need extensive vision for combat. So, should I try it? Try it!\nSu Ping made his decision in an instant:\n[Consumed 100 Experience Points from the Paperman Record. Deduction failed. Next attempt success rate increased!]\n[Consumed 100 Experience Points from the Paperman Record. Deduction failed. Next attempt success rate increased!]\n[Consumed 100 Experience Points from the Paperman Record. Deduction failed. Next attempt success rate increased!]\n[...]\nSu Ping’s eyes turned bloodshot. He had burned through over a thousand Experience Points, leaving him with only a couple hundred. It was only then that he finally came to his senses.\nWhat kind of messed-up system is this? How come this trick feels so familiar? Gacha? Or gambling?\nAt this moment, Su Ping gained a new insight in life, following his previous mantra that ’riddle-makers deserve death’:\nGamblers deserve a terrible fate!\nHe let out a long sigh and walked out the door.\nThe sunlight outside was incredibly blinding, making him feel somewhat dazed.\nFortunately, just then, the ringing of his phone diverted the heartbroken Su Ping’s attention.\nIt was a call from Dong Muyun.\nSu Ping answered, and Dong Muyun’s voice chirped from the other end, \"Su Ping! Come to the main entrance of Yun Tian. I’ve brought you that big toy you’ve been longing for!\"\nIn an instant, Su Ping’s eyes brightened.\nCould he finally get some payback against Su Anyong?",

The Incomplete Mechanical Core!\nThis was a pitch-black work of art!\nIndeed, Su Ping still described it as a \"work of art.\"\nMainly, its design was just too exaggerated.\nSu Ping could see every cool pose and ferocious feature he could imagine embodied in this thing.\nIt was entirely pitch-black. Where the wheels should be, bright red lines snaked across, resembling fresh blood or perhaps blazing flames.\nIt was fancy, yet without that ghostly vibe. The texture of the car’s body was extremely unique.\nIts low-slung body, combined with a floating chassis, ensured it could glide over almost any terrain with ease.\nAs Su Ping caressed the shell of this thing, he was dazzled and mesmerized.\nIt truly is cool.\nThere was no doubt about its appeal, evident from the gazes of guests coming and going at the Yuntian Resort entrance, and the many people who had gathered to look.\nFew men with conventional tastes could dislike such a thing.\nDong Muyun stood by, a smug smile playing on her lips. \"Like it?\"\n\"Love it, love it!\" Su Ping immediately nodded.\n\"Glad you like it! This thing’s value is even higher than my Red King!\"\nSu Ping raised an eyebrow, looking at the woman in surprise. \"Oh?\"\nDong Muyun gave him a knowing glance, tossed the keys over, and then slipped into the passenger seat of this thing.\nSu Ping caught the keys and got into the car as well.\nThe interior was still dominated by black, but it was blended with a dark, night-blue style.\nEvidently, the restless energy of its black and red exterior signified an unrivaled, surging passion.\nMeanwhile, the dark, night-blue interior was designed to keep the driver cool and composed at all times.\nA great design style; I really like it.\nHowever, it’s clear this thing isn’t just about its appearance.\n\"For this thing of yours, value-wise, several hundred million wouldn’t cover it!\" Dong Muyun said, a self-congratulatory smile on her face.\n\"Oh? Are the materials very precious?\"\n\"More than just precious materials?\" Dong Muyun snorted lightly. \"Generally speaking, the Mechanical Core of an intelligent sports car is a semi-finished product from a failed Mechanical Pet Beast awakening, but this one is different!\"\nSu Ping looked at the triumphant Dong Muyun. \"What?\"\nThe value of a Mechanical Core was clear from their previous bet.\nSu Ping felt a keen pang of regret for not having obtained that Mechanical Core.\n\"You mean, this isn’t just an intelligent sports car? It’s a Mechanical Pet Beast?\"\nAmong all Pet Beasts, Mechanical Pet Beasts—a type that had emerged in the last century—were renowned as luxury items.\nTime-Series Pet Beasts were exceptionally rare, while Mechanical Pet Beasts demanded vast sums of money and resources for both their creation and cultivation.\nStill, as a special type of Pet Beast with great potential, countless Beast Tamers, once they had sufficient resources, chose a Mechanical Pet Beast as their Contracted Beast.\nA sports car that’s a Mechanical Pet Beast with an awakened Mechanical Core? Its value is indeed far greater than a regular intelligent sports car.\nCould this woman really have gotten an awakened Mechanical Core to use as her big toy?\nIsn’t that too extravagant?\nClearly, Su Ping had been overthinking it.\nDong Muyun touched her nose, slightly embarrassed, then gave him an irritated glance. \"What are you babbling about? If you want to use a Mechanical Core to attempt to awaken a Mechanical Pet Beast, that’s possible. But how could I let you play with an already awakened Mechanical Pet Beast?\"\n\"So this is...\" Su Ping trailed off.\nThrown off by Su Ping, Dong Muyun lost the desire to keep him in suspense. \"This Mechanical Core is in a state of semi-awakening, but it can no longer continue the process.\"\n\"Semi-awakening?\" Su Ping asked.\nMechanical Pet Beasts were luxury items, so Su Ping clearly didn’t know much about Mechanical Cores.\nDong Muyun patiently continued to explain, \"The origin of a Mechanical Pet Beast is its Mechanical Core; you should know that, right?\n\"A Mechanical Core is to Mechanical Pet Beasts what the heart and brain are to animal-type Pet Beasts, what roots are to Plant Type Pet Beasts, what Crystalline Cores are to Elemental Beast Pets, and what Soul Fire is to Undead Pet Beasts.\n\"The birth of the Mechanical Core was an accidental discovery by a Breeder from Lion Country, the so-called Sun Never Sets Empire. It’s a special object formed from the combination of the Heart of Gold Element and Electromagnetic Force.\n\"People discovered that after this combination, this ’Heart of Gold Element’ transformed into something entirely new.\n\"This new object could integrate with and control any mechanical entity, developing a consciousness similar to Elementalization, except it couldn’t possess an elemental body. Instead, it would use the connected mechanical structures as its body.\"\nSu Ping nodded. In the industrial age, the emergence of such a Pet Beast, perfectly suited to the era, represented another leap forward in the history of human Pet Beast cultivation.\n\"So, there are two steps in the awakening process of a Mechanical Core!\" Dong Muyun explained. \"The first step, which is the hardest and most important, is to transmit information to the Mechanical Core to allow it to develop intelligence and self-awareness!\"\nShe continued, \"Usually, once this first step is completed and the Mechanical Core successfully develops self-awareness and intelligence, the Mechanical Pet Beast’s awakening can be considered complete.\n\"This is because the second step—connecting to a mechanical body and shaping its mechanical form—is quite simple.\"",

Some Mechanists speculate that this Mechanical Core is incomplete. Thus, it can only be controlled via electronic sensors, unlike Mechanical Pet Beasts, which can even alter their mechanical bodies at will.\nListening to Dong Muyun’s explanation, Su Ping scratched his head.\nSo that’s how it is.\nSimultaneously, the screen lit up: \"Hello, welcome aboard Black Blood. I am the car’s driving intelligence. You can call me Feifei! Handsome friend, are you Feifei’s owner?\"\nA clear, synthesized electronic voice sounded in the car.\nTo be honest, Su Ping’s eyes lit up. This voice was definitely more emotional than Super Shadow’s, and certainly more than Dong Muyun’s Red King. It was also more lively and could even ask questions proactively.\nSu Ping blinked and replied, \"Yes!\"\n\"Dear owner, it is Feifei’s honor to serve you. Since this is your first time driving Black Blood, please look directly at the screen so I can bind Black Blood to your pupils!\"\nSu Ping, following Feifei’s instructions, looked directly at the screen. Instantly, a flash of light appeared.\n\"Binding complete. Dear owner, would you like Feifei to introduce the abilities of Black Blood to you?\"\nThe electronic voice seemed to become even more vivid and bubbly. In fact, with the awakening of self-awareness, the Mechanical Core was already considered a special form of life, no different from any other Pet Beast. However, this special Mechanical Core named Feifei couldn’t connect to a Mechanical Pet Beast’s body and possess various abilities like other Mechanical Pet Beasts. It could only serve as a highly intelligent control center within a smart sports car.\n\"Of course.\"\n\"Black Blood’s external material is crafted from Gold Oak Rubber fused with high-precision carbon fiber, capable of withstanding attacks from Pet Beasts below Monarch Level with exceptional protective strength!\n\"And even when facing attacks at Monarch Level, it can immediately withstand the impact while activating the Space Chip installed in the car, performing a one-time spatial transfer to transport the owner to the nearest hospital within range.\n\"It can protect the owner’s life to the greatest extent possible!\n\"Additionally, as an ultra-light sports car, Black Blood’s maximum speed can exceed 600 kilometers per hour. However, according to Dragon Nation’s laws, this speed cannot be used on city streets or roads with vehicular traffic.\n\"Speeds above 200 kilometers per hour require a Commander Level Beast Tamer’s physical condition to manually control; when the speed reaches over 400 kilometers per hour, intelligent takeover is required.\n\"Black Blood has certain levitation capabilities, allowing for a degree of low-altitude...\"\nThis intelligent life named Feifei introduced all the capabilities and functions of the sports car known as Black Blood.\nSu Ping listened and nodded in satisfaction.\nHe couldn’t wait to take it out for a spin.\nWasn’t this much cooler than that Super Shadow thing his old man had?\nWhen this old guy comes back, I’ll let him know what a true ultimate supercar is!\nWith that thought, Su Ping directly grabbed the steering wheel!\n\"Let’s go! I’ll take you for a spin!\"\nDong Muyun rolled her eyes at the excited Su Ping but didn’t refuse, leaning back in the passenger seat, her beautiful eyes smilingly fixed on him.\nBut as soon as the vehicle left the Heart of Woods, Dong Muyun pursed her red lips and pointed out the window, \"Is this how you take me for a spin?\"\nNot far away, a bus started moving slowly; even at its sluggish speed, it still overtook the ultra-stylish supercar. This drew some curious looks from the bus passengers.\nSuch an exaggerated sports car design, yet it moves like a bicycle?\nSu Ping shot her a glance. \"What do you know? There are countless roads, but safety is always first. Drive irresponsibly, and your loved ones pay with tears! I’m way past my reckless street-racing days.\"\nStreet racing?\nDong Muyun silently watched the slow autumn scenery passing by outside the window and said no more.\nThis continued until the car’s intelligence, Feifei, finally reminded him, \"Master, you are currently on Linzhou City’s suburban highway. Driving too slowly might affect the traffic behind you. I suggest you increase your speed to 30 kilometers per hour.\"\n\"PFFT...\" Unable to hold back any longer, Dong Muyun burst out laughing.\nSu Ping simply spread his hands. \"Activate autopilot mode! Loop around Lingxi River Station within a ten-kilometer radius!\"\n\"Okay, Master!\"\nAs the car slowly sped up, Su Ping cast a sidelong glance at Dong Muyun. \"You’ve been quite free lately, haven’t you?\"\nDong Muyun shrugged and nodded. \"Indeed, quite free.\"\nSu Ping asked suspiciously, \"Tianyun Group has nothing for you to do?\"\n\"If Dong Mutian wants to handle it, let him. Besides, don’t we still have our Pingyun?\"\nOurs?\nSu Ping found this wording odd but still asked, \"How’s business been these days?\"\nAs soon as this topic came up, Dong Muyun became visibly excited. \"Excluding the orders from the Legions and the Breeder Association these past few days, just from wholesalers and some Wolf Pet breeding bases, I’ve already sold close to a hundred thousand units!\"",

The Incomplete Mechanical Core!_3\n\"One hundred thousand?!\"\nSu Ping couldn’t help but take a sharp breath.\nBased on Dong Muyun’s selling price, this means that with the sales in these past days, excluding labor costs, the profit must have reached hundreds of millions or even billions?\nSu Ping was tongue-tied.\n\"Don’t get too excited too soon, though. After the sales, the market will need time to absorb it, and the effect can’t possibly remain this strong. Of course, for now, this is only within Jianghai Province, and the whole market in Dragon Nation is still vast. The future potential for Heart of the Wolf is immense!\"\nDong Muyun narrowed her eyes slightly.\nShe was very satisfied with such profit and results.\nWhat’s most important is that nobody else dares to covet such a terrifyingly profitable business!\nOf course, that doesn’t include certain so-called second generations. Dong Muyun herself was the biggest second generation. What she was referring to was the Dong Family itself.\nAfter Dong Mutian returned, he would definitely conduct a thorough investigation into Su Ping’s identity. But no one else had bypassed Dong Muyun to contact Su Ping. This had already achieved her goal of putting on a show for Lin Lei, Dong Mutian, and Dong San.\n\"Dong Mutian hasn’t troubled you again?\" Su Ping glanced at her.\nWhen the subject of business came up, Dong Muyun seemed to suddenly remember something, her eyebrows lifting slightly, \"No, Dong Mutian probably doesn’t have the energy for it recently, right?\"\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\"A competitor from the same industry has arrived in Jianghai Province, mainly focusing on Pet Beast real estate, directly competing with Tianyun Real Estate. Many plots of land around Linzhou, which Tianyun was virtually certain to acquire, were surprisingly snatched up by the competitor.\"\nDong Muyun seemed a bit like she was gloating.\n\"Someone managed to snatch land from Tianyun’s hands? They must have a significant background, right?\"\nFrom this glimpse, Su Ping could sense the strength of the Dong Family.\nTo be able to snatch something from the Dong Family’s grasp was truly unbelievable.\nHowever, Dong Muyun’s peculiar gaze made Su Ping uneasy. \"Of course they have a big background. Didn’t you know?\"\n\"Know what?\"\n\"Hasn’t Miss Qin mentioned it to you?\"\nSu Ping’s eyelids twitched again.\nWhat did this have to do with Qin Xiaoxue?\nHe shook his head.\nOnly then did Dong Muyun give a meaningful smile, \"This time, it’s Dachuan Company that has come, a real estate company based in Magic Capital. Although it’s a company that emerged in recent years, its rise has been quite rapid. Now they are expanding their corporate influence and reaching out to Jianghai! And this Dachuan Company was founded and is managed by Qin Chuan.\"\nQin?\nBefore Su Ping could react, Dong Muyun nodded, smiling, \"That’s right, the son of President Qin, Miss Qin’s father.\"\n...\nIn the highest office within the Beast Master Association building in Linzhou City, Qin Erlong savored the tea in his cup, smiling slightly, \"So the shore across this Endless Sea Domain also has good tea, huh? Tastes not bad.\"\nHe set down the teacup, looked at the man who resembled him by about sixty percent, and continued with a smile, \"How long are you planning to stay in Linzhou this time?\"\nThe man thought for a moment and said, \"No rush. I haven’t had tea and played chess with you for a long time...\"\nQin Erlong quickly waved his hand. \"Don’t do that. It’s too staid for young people. You should do what you’re meant to do.\"\nThe man felt somewhat awkward. \"Alright, I’ll go back to Magic Capital before New Year’s Day after I finish the project here.\"\nThere was naturally not much conversation between father and son.\nThe atmosphere grew a tad silent; then, Qin Erlong spoke again, \"Xiaochuan, your mom has talked to me about the previous matter. That’s just her disposition. It’s been many years, so don’t take it to heart.\"\n\"Yes,\" the man answered. What he truly felt in his heart remained unknown.\n\"You mentioned that a Senior Breeder from Eagle Country came with you this time, right?\" Qin Erlong changed the subject.\nQin Chuan nodded. \"Breeder Mu is originally from Jianghai, so this is also a return to his homeland.\"\nQin Erlong’s brows furrowed slightly. \"Xiaochuan, your mom’s tone might have been a bit harsh, but her reasoning and intention are correct. Dragon Nation is at a critical juncture right now. You must have heard of that person’s iron-handed approach. Your mother’s position is vital. The Magic Capital will be the first to undergo the educational reforms next year, and during such a time, we cannot afford any slip-ups or unexpected changes.\"\nQin Chuan’s expression showed no change as he nodded. \"Yes, I understand. Breeder Mu won’t stay in Dragon Nation for too long either... I’ll be careful in the future.\"\nQin Erlong then smiled with satisfaction. \"Hehe, as long as you understand, that’s good. Anyway, why be so formal between father and son? Come, let’s drink tea.\"\nQin Chuan also showed a smile, but he did not take the teacup from Qin Erlong; instead, he pulled out a small pouch from his inner pocket. \"Dad, I specially brought this Snow Ice Tea for you to try. I can’t bear to drink it myself; this will do for me.\"\nHe brewed a cup of coffee using the small pouch.\nInstantly, the scent of tea and coffee mingled in the office, creating a rather peculiar aroma.\nAfter finishing their drinks, Qin Chuan stood up. \"Dad, I’ve got some things to attend to; we’ll talk more in the evening.\"\n\"Sure!\" Qin Erlong stood up with a smile on his face.\nHowever, just as Qin Chuan was about to turn and leave, Old Qin suddenly spoke out, \"Xiaochuan!\"\nQin Chuan turned around, looking at Qin Erlong in surprise.\n\"About Xiao Xue’s future, everyone has their own destiny. You didn’t like it when your mom controlled your life; likewise, Xiao Xue won’t appreciate it either...\"\nQin Chuan squinted his eyes slightly, and suddenly a smile bloomed. \"I’d heard before that Xiao Xue seemed to have met a young man in Linzhou. Originally, I thought you might overlook it, but Mother would definitely not agree. Now it seems this truly is a case of affection skipping a generation! I’m quite curious now: what kind of person is this young fellow, to be able to leave even Mother without objections?\"\nAfter saying this, Qin Chuan turned and left.",

      "content": "Chapter 249: Chapter 155: Qian Yi’s Evolution Opportunity! The True Swordsman!\nQin Chuan’s arrival clearly had nothing to do with Su Ping.\nAt least, that’s what I thought.\nSu Ping considered.\nMy relationship with Miss Qin is truly innocent and pure!\nSo, after happily playing with the smart supercar ’Black Blood’ for two days, Su Ping shifted his attention back to Qian Yi.\nThe little paperman’s evolution was the number one priority in his heart. By comparison, he wasn’t even in a hurry to attend to the construction of the Heart of Woods.\nDuring the Paperman’s last evolution, the little paperman mastered the ’One-Word Electric Sword,’ and the Light of Evolution appeared. Since then, everything else had to make way for the little paperman’s affairs. Apart from Forest Wolf, who was still continuously connected and sharing in the cultivation of the Heart of Woods, there was truly nothing more important than the little paperman.\nDuring this period, the little paperman studied Swordsmanship. Su Ping fed him a Metal Element and a Necromancy System resource every other day. However, he spent even more time researching the Paperman’s evolution.\nIt turned out that after comprehending the Paperman’s Paper Body Joint, its evolution was indeed very simple.\nOver the past few days, its form was still that of the Paper Swords, but it was no longer just the previous Paper Swords·Thunder. There was also a Paper Swords·Fire and a Paper Swords·Wind.\nThat’s right.\nThe Paperman’s Evolutionary Forms, surprisingly, now included these two new different types based on their Attribute: Paperman·Wind and Paperman·Fire.\nBesides providing Su Ping with another four hundred Experience Points for the Origami Man Record, this undoubtedly also perfected the little paperman’s Three Sword Style.\nThree Paper Swords: Wind, Thunder, Fire.\nOver these days, Su Ping had fed the little paperman quite a lot of various resources. However, after consuming these Advanced Level resources, the little paperman only felt uncomfortably bloated. This necessitated constant practice to vent the excess Energy, but there were no other significant effects.\nTherefore, Su Ping had essentially ruled out the possibility of insufficient Evolution Energy. So, in his view, the only requirement for the little paperman’s evolution was likely to continue mastering new Swordsmanship and then perfect its mutated Sword Body Skills.\nEvolving by comprehending Skills wasn’t exactly a rare cultivation method for evolution. After all, the evolution of the Immortal White Bone Sword seen before, and the Paperman’s own Paper Body Joint, were even more obscure and unprecedented methods of Evolution.\nConsequently, this second Swordsmanship, self-created by the little paperman during this period, became the absolute top priority. The three swords requested by the little fellow were finally completed by Su Ping.\nSu Ping also wanted to see just what sort of Swordsmanship the little paperman had created.\nThe power of ten elite Papermen gathered! Three Paper Swords represented the combined form of nine Papermen. Adding Qian Yi’s own body to that, the implication was self-evident.\nBut with three swords, what kind of Energy manipulation would be needed to create this so-called Swordsmanship?\nSu Ping had previously advised the little paperman that he could just continue using one sword. However, Qian Yi’s Paper Body Control seemed to make using multiple swords simultaneously more challenging and appealing, boosting his confidence.\nAnd so, it ultimately led to this situation.\nThe little paperman looked serious. And at the same time, this was a face Su Ping had never seen before.\nAlthough Su Ping had long harbored suspicions, the sight of this abstract thing still made the corner of his mouth twitch involuntarily.\nIt was a 3.\nAlthough Su Ping didn’t know how diamonds were distinguished from hearts in this context, he had, undeniably, figured out the little paperman’s Swordsmanship system.\nOne sword is the Ace of Hearts, so three swords make a 3 of Diamonds? Does the playing card on his face change according to the number of swords?\nSu Ping shook his head and continued to watch.\nSure enough, it was still the initial action. Qian Yi suddenly thrust a sword into his own chest. The blade, piercing through his chest, was fixed directly to his body—perhaps even more securely than if held by hand.\nNotably, the sword plunged into his chest was the Paper Swords·Wind, one of the three.\nThe Wind System as the core?\nSu Ping’s eyes slowly narrowed.\nHe had absolute, one hundred percent faith and confidence in the little paperman. He could doubt other things, but when it came to the sword, the little paperman was absolutely infallible. He might not trust the little paperman completely, but he had to trust the Sword Intent Origin and the Sword Soul from the Soul Seed.\nSo, he watched with rapt attention. At that moment, the little paperman once again entered a state of gathering power, ready to unleash it.\nTwo swords were held in his hands, but his grip was vastly different from before. He no longer held them with a standard two-handed grip; instead, his right hand held the Thunder Sword in a normal grip, while his left hand held the Fire Sword in a reverse grip.\nThe blades of the three swords, along with the longsword piercing his chest, seemed to envelop the little paperman’s entire body in a cocoon of swords.\nThe next moment, the little paperman moved.\nHowever, his movements were slightly different from what Su Ping had anticipated.\nThe little paperman’s waist twisted slightly. Simultaneously, an invisible current of air seemed to stir and swirl throughout the entire Undead basement. The Undead basement was completely sealed; obviously, there couldn’t naturally be any wind at this moment.\nTherefore, the origin of this wisp of wind was quite clear.",

      "content": "Chapter 250: Chapter 155: Qian Yi’s Evolution Opportunity! The True Swordsman!_2\nStreams of air seemed to ripple beneath the Little Paperman’s feet.\nThis stream of air appeared to swirl around its body, forming an invisible cyclone of wind force.\nThe next moment, the Little Paperman suddenly swung its dual swords.\nAccompanied by the terrifying cyclone, the Attributes of Flame and thunder changed under its control, and the whirlwind below it seemed to merge with them.\nThen, the speed of its sword swings became faster and faster!\nBefore Su Ping’s eyes, the Little Paperman seemed to transform into a rapidly spinning top under the rotation of this force!\nExcept, at the edge of this ’top,’ the whirlwind was mixed with Flame and thunder, forming a fearsome edge where a mere graze meant death, and contact spelled doom!\nSword Blade Storm?\nSu Ping was startled.\nHe observed the Little Paperman’s swiftly spinning figure, and the soil, bricks, and stones that involuntarily flew towards it, drawn by the spinning wind force.\nWith just a slight touch, they were immediately slashed to pieces.\nWhat kind of power was this?\nThree seconds passed. The ’Sword Blade Storm’ lasted only three seconds before the Little Paperman’s movements halted.\nWatching the Little Paperman’s wobbling body, the corners of Su Ping’s mouth twitched.\nClearly, the Little Paperman wasn’t quite accustomed to this Swordsmanship yet. After performing it, its steps were somewhat shaky.\nEven so, a glow still appeared on the Little Paperman. That was the glow of a Skill the Little Paperman had comprehended!\nIn this respect, one could always trust Qian Yi:\n[Qian Yi Cyclone (Proficiency): A unique sword move created by Qian Yi, amalgamating the elemental Attributes of wind, Flame, and thunder. It relies on high-speed rotation to restrict an opponent’s movement, using Flame- and thunder-infused sword edges to crush all enemies! This Skill belongs to the ’Diamond 3’ series of Swordsmanship of the Variant Origami Man Qian Yi!]\nHoly damn, Qian Yi Cyclone!\nSu Ping was dumbstruck.\nHow exactly did it come up with this self-created sword Skill? And why did the creator have the right to such a cheeky name?\nThe previous One-Word Electric Sword was forgivable; after all, Su Ping had plagiarized it.\nBut this time, he hadn’t paid attention, and Qian Yi had seized the opportunity to produce this so-called Qian Yi Cyclone.\nHowever, Su Ping’s attention soon shifted from the aggravating name, and he slowly furrowed his brows.\nHe noticed that although the Little Paperman before him was dizzy, it had indeed comprehended the Sword Technique completely.\nYet, it showed no sign of Evolving.\nThe Light of Evolution he was desperately awaiting still didn’t appear!\nStill not enough?!\nSu Ping’s brows knitted together.\nWere two Sword Technique Skills not enough? Such requirements for Evolution seemed a bit too preposterous, didn’t they?\nNo, that’s not right!\nThis was only an Elite First Rank variant Paperman.\nEven though it was a variant, the theoretical difficulty of Evolving should not be too high.\nGrasping three separate sword moves, with the aid of the Paper Swords, didn’t seem that difficult. However, it had already surpassed some fundamental principles of Cultivation and seemed somewhat far-fetched.\nSo, had he been wrong? Did the Evolution of the Little Paperman not relate to its Sword Technique Skills at all?\nBut Su Ping had tried everything.\nThe resources from the Metal Element and the Necromancy System had all been used adequately on the Little Paperman.\nYet it was still unable to Evolve.\nWhat, then, was the key to Qian Yi’s Evolution?\nAt that moment, Su Ping was genuinely baffled.\nMutant Pet Beasts, just as Liu Fuhai had said, indeed came with high risks and high rewards.\nWhat he had thought was a surefire Evolution had yet to occur.\nThe dizzy Qian Yi finally came to its senses.\nSu Ping was out of options. According to his Breeder theory, the Little Paperman should have already met all conditions. The only other possibility was that it needed to continue comprehending, upgrading its Paper Body Control and variant Sword Body Skills to Mastery Level.\nBut then again, that didn’t make sense.\nThe Light of Evolution was already flickering on the Little Paperman, indicating that it was only one step away from completing its Evolution.\nIf the Skill Levels were not up to par, generally speaking, the Light of Evolution would not flicker.\nSu Ping looked at Qian Yi and asked, \"Qian Yi, can you feel any impetus within yourself?\"\nQian Yi made a questioning sound, looking at him with a puzzled, anime-style expression.\nSu Ping let out a helpless sigh. Clearly, asking Qian Yi about such matters wasn’t very reliable.\nHowever, as if finally understanding Su Ping’s question, Qian Yi hesitated for a moment and then looked invigorated.\nIt chirped excitedly, its thoughts conveying clearly, \"I want to become... a real Swordsman!\"\nThis statement, within the Telepathic Communication, sounded so familiar.\nIt even made Su Ping pause for a moment.\nBecause this was something the Little Paperman had said once before.\nThat was when he first tricked the Little Paperman into coming to the Heart of Woods to acknowledge him as its master.\nIt was the reason Su Ping had used to cajole it.\nA real Swordsman!\nAnd now, the Little Paperman had spoken these words again.\nImpulse, goal, or perhaps, a dream?\nSu Ping’s brows slowly relaxed, and then he fell into contemplation.\nA real Swordsman, eh?\nHe turned his head and looked at the Little Paperman. \"Little fellow, you already have swords, you have Swordsmanship. So, what is it that you lack to become a real Swordsman?\"\nThe Little Paperman tilted its head, making a confused sound that conveyed, \"What is it?\"\nSu Ping fell silent. At that moment, he suddenly had an epiphany.\nPerhaps the Little Paperman had already declared its path of Evolution, its method of evolutionary Cultivation, from the very beginning!",

      "content": "Chapter 251: Chapter 155: Qian Yi’s Evolution Opportunity! The True Swordsman!_3\nThat was its goal: it wanted to become a true Swordsman!\nBut, having obtained its own sword and comprehended its own swordsmanship, what was it still missing to ultimately become a true Swordsman?\nRight, what was it still missing?\nSu Ping didn’t know either.\nThe Paperman now seemed to have thoroughly fulfilled all the conditions to be a true Swordsman; the sword and swordsmanship themselves were symbols of a Swordsman.\nBut could the Paperman still not be called a Swordsman now?\nSu Ping pursed his lips. He turned his head, his gaze slightly intensifying.\nHe suddenly looked beyond the isolation glass wall of the Undead basement, a place ordinary Papermen couldn’t go, but Qian Yi could come and go freely.\nThere were sofas for resting. To cater to the Paperman’s mood, Su Ping had also placed the martial arts film projection screen there. It was the Paperman’s biggest pastime and entertainment, and Su Ping wasn’t cruel enough to deprive it of that.\nSo, occasionally, when the Paperman was tired from training, it would come here. These projections were still playing those old movies and martial arts discs that Su Ping had found, on a 24-hour loop.\nAt this moment, the film playing on the basement projection screen was at a very special point.\nIt was when the film’s protagonist, at the lowest point in his life, obtained his fortuitous encounter: the Sword-type Pet Beast with Spirit Saint Level potential called the Snowfall Divine Sword.\nClearly, it was a very traditional martial arts film.\nAlmost all elements were integrated into it along with the Beastmaster system: revenge, fortuitous encounters, the manipulator behind the scenes, winning the beauty, a perfect ending, and invincibility in the world.\nThe film’s protagonist started off miserable, his family devastated due to someone’s schemes, without even a chance to get a Contracted Beast. Afterward, with the Snowfall Divine Sword, he suddenly rose to power.\nAt this moment, the plot of the film was at this stage.\nClearly, many people could guess the subsequent plot. But the story of an underdog rising against all odds to become a dominant figure was one many enjoyed.\nHowever, even with a fortuitous encounter, it wasn’t so simple to rise to power. After all, Zhang Wuji had spent five or six years playing with monkeys before he managed to master the Nine Yang Divine Skill.\nOf course, the timeframe in films isn’t like in TV series. Everyone knew that this stage wasn’t achieved overnight, but it could be shown through accelerated shooting techniques.\nSeveral years’ worth of time was consumed in the flickering of scenes in the film.\nDuring this period, the protagonist of the film was communicating with the Snowfall Divine Sword. He was honing his spiritual power and learning to control Sword Artifact-type Pet Beasts. At the same time, he was waiting for his strength to reach the level where he could leave the mountains.\nSu Ping turned his head back, his gaze firmly fixed on the movie screen.\nHe had regretted letting the Paperman watch these things before, for it hadn’t learned a thing, just damn well learned the set of a Swordsman’s show-off moves. But now, it seemed that it wasn’t entirely a bad thing.\nWatching the scenes, at this moment, Su Ping seemed to finally understand something.\nHe felt as if he realized what the Paperman Qian Yi was still lacking to become a true Swordsman!\nFinally, within the projector screen, a resounding thunderous explosion was heard.\nAs the film’s protagonist held the Snowfall Divine Sword, looking towards the vast horizon, all viewers knew that at this moment, the protagonist of the film had mastered his divine skill! Or rather, he had finally cultivated the so-called Snowfall Divine Sword to the strength necessary for him to exact his revenge.\nSo at this time, was the film’s protagonist a true Swordsman? No!\nBecause at this moment, the film’s screen didn’t expound on the protagonist’s words or push the plot; there were only the scenes and actions of the protagonist stepping down the mountain.\nIn fact, the segment of him descending the mountain was almost as lengthy as the montage depicting his several years of sword practice.\nBut, nearly every step the film’s protagonist took on the road down was thrilling because everyone knew the time that followed was when the protagonist would truly show his strength!\nThe previous scenes, plot, and achievements were all about practicing the sword.\nBut one who only practices the sword is not a Swordsman! One who draws the sword is!\nOnly when one truly draws the sword, truly faces an enemy, do people know the sword is not just a decoration! That is a true Swordsman!\nIt had to be said, this film was truly worthy of being ranked among the top martial arts films online.\nEven Su Ping, watching it again now, felt his heart stir involuntarily along with it.\nThe pace of the plot seemed to have reached its peak at this moment! Because the film’s protagonist had finally made his entrance, arriving at the residence of his nemesis, which he had imagined countless times over the years.\nThe screen seemed to freeze at this point. The protagonist adjusted his bamboo hat, looking towards his nemesis’s residence. At this moment, with nothing else present, accompanied only by the protagonist’s award-winning acting and gaze, the film’s subtitles displayed a poem Su Ping had heard in both his past and present lives:\n’Ten years to forge a sword, its frost blade never tested.’\n’Today I present it to thee, who has injustices unaddressed?’\nNow, in this era’s Beastmaster Society, this poem was revered as the ultimate truth by Sword-type Pet Beast Tamers of all ages.\nToday I present it to thee, who has injustices unaddressed?!\nThe romanticism and boldness of the Swordsman were undoubtedly revealed in that final line!\nAt the same time, following the poem in the narration, the film’s pace was driven to its climax.\nEven though it later investigated the so-called nemesis and conspiracy, all the film’s lengthy buildup exploded forth at this moment.\nSu Ping’s eyes shone brightly. At this moment, he finally understood completely and was also certain.\nWhat the Paperman Qian Yi still lacked to become a true Swordsman... That was it: an opponent!",

      "content": "Chapter 252: Chapter 156: Lightning Flashes! Qian Yi Evolves!\nThe Breeder Association building: amidst countless gazes, Su Ping descended from the \"Black Blood.\"\nThe grotesque and exaggerated black sports car captured the attention of numerous onlookers.\nSatisfied, Su Ping stowed the item into his Beast Taming Space and only then did he enter the building.\nFor the entire day and night yesterday, Su Ping had been helping the little Paperman, Qian Yi, in his search for a so-called opponent.\nHe wanted to see it become a true Swordsman in the course of their duels.\nRegrettably, the final result was not promising.\nNeither Forest Wolf nor any other Pet Beasts from the Yuntian Resort met the Paperman’s criteria for an ’opponent.’\nHowever, during its clashes with various opponents, the Paperman did indeed display more frequent flashes of the Light of Evolution on its body.\nTherefore, Su Ping surmised that the opponents it required were either sword-oriented Pet Beasts and Beast Tamers, similar sword-wielding Pet Beasts, or perhaps the style of combat was at fault.\nYet, no matter the possibility, the Heart of Woods base could no longer meet the requirements.\nSo Su Ping had once again come to the Breeder Association.\nWith this in mind, he promptly made his way to Old Liu’s office upstairs.\nHowever, in his haste, he failed to notice several figures within the curious crowd. Unlike the general awe, their gazes held a different kind of admiration.\nA group of four.\nThis quartet also drew the surrounding onlookers’ attention.\nTwo of them, with blond hair and blue eyes, were clearly not from the Dragon Nation.\nThe other two, however, exhibited standard Dragon Nation features.\nOne of them even wanted to greet the rushing Su Ping but, alas, Su Ping was moving too fast and completely missed the person hidden in the crowd.\nThe leader of the group, an elderly man with a pale complexion, turned to the middle-aged man beside him and asked with a smile, \"Judging by your expression, do you know this ostentatious youngster?\"\n\"Yes, Father, this is the very Genius Breeder from Jianghai that I told you about: the favored Su Ping of Teacher Liu,\" Mu Hang replied.\n\"Tsk, a Genius Breeder?\"\nThe elder nodded. \"That old man Liu Fuhai has only had two wishes for so many years: one is to bring honor to Jianghai, and the other is to advance to a Breeding Master. It seems that with the advent of this young man, the first wish should soon come true. Mu Hang, you haven’t made much progress at all over the years!\"\nMu Hang, unashamed, simply laughed it off, \"I’m not cut out for this. Naturally, I can’t compare to geniuses like Su Ping.\"\nThe elder glanced at his son and then looked up at the familiar yet unfamiliar Breeder Association building, shaking his head and sighing, \"Many years have passed since I last returned to Linzhou. Even the most familiar places have changed!\"\nThe blond, blue-eyed foreigner chuckled, \"Respected Breeding Master Mu, while the Beast Tamers of the Dragon Nation are far from the level of those in my Eagle Country, they certainly don’t lose out to any other nation when it comes to saving face.\"\nBefore the Mu father-son duo could respond, the younger blond, blue-eyed youth scoffed disdainfully, \"What sort of Breeding genius can the Dragon Nation’s environment produce, dear senior brother... If you had the chance to visit the Eagle Country, you’d understand. Only there is the true paradise for all Pet Beast Breeders! Only in the Eagle Country can Breeders fully tap into the potential of Pet Beasts. The Dragon Nation? Their emperor is probably still reveling in the past!\"\nMu Hang glanced at the foreign youngster. He didn’t know why his father had taken such an arrogant disciple from across the ocean. However, he had to admit it was rare for a young person from the Eagle Country to speak the Dragon Nation’s language as fluently as an embassy diplomat.\nHowever, just as Sun Chaoju had previously said, Mu Hang was different from his father.\nSo he calmly said, \"Su Ping awakened his talent less than half a year ago. In that time, he has already developed the Wanmu Wolf, a new evolutionary form for the Forest Wolf. This effectively makes him a Senior Breeder specializing in Forest Wolves... Though I do not know about the Eagle Country, such an accomplishment, I suspect, is rare over there as well...\"\nThe young man named Chris opened his mouth, momentarily struggling to respond, \"What? Senior Breeder? A new evolutionary form?\"\nMu Yu also clicked his tongue, \"Right, last time you mentioned that this youngster seemed to be researching the evolution of Necromancy Series Pet Beasts?\"\nMu Hang nodded, then glanced at his father and, after some thought, decided not to keep it a secret, \"That’s correct, and... it is also research concerning the Paperman...\"\nThis time, Mu Yu was truly taken aback, as if he had realized something, and a glimmer of darkness flickered in his eyes again.\nMeanwhile, Chris laughed out loud again, \"Ridiculous Dragon Nation people. Do they not realize that the Paperman is deemed the disgrace of the Necromancy System? Or, is it that this mere fresh graduate dares to challenge the authority of many Necromancy-specialized Breeders?\"\nIndeed, the specialized research on the Forest Wolf reaching an Advanced Level was admirable.\nBut to abandon his specialized research on the Forest Wolf, or at least on comparable wolf-type Pet Beasts, was undoubtedly emblematic of the Dragon Nation’s arrogance.\nSuch arrogance and pride were doomed to be fleeting!",

Didn’t I leave a note here at the Breeder Association back then? Hmm, didn’t Liu Fuhai show it to this kid?\"\nMu Hang nodded. \"Of course he has seen it, but Su Ping probably has his own thoughts...\"\n\"Right, a genius after all...\" Mu Yu mused.\nThe group of four chatted as they walked into the main hall of the Breeder Association.\n「Meanwhile, in the office of Liu Fuhai.」\nOld Liu looked rather oddly at Su Ping before him. \"You’re saying you’ve come today to have your mutated Paperman complete its evolution? Are you sure?\"\nAre *you* sure?\nWhether Su Ping was sure or not, Old Liu didn’t know. But Old Liu was genuinely uncertain.\nAs an Advanced Level Wolf Pet Breeder, he had experience assisting various mutated Wolf Pets in researching their evolutionary paths. The difficulty was exceptionally high, completely different from the evolution of other Pet Beast types. Under such circumstances, it was normal for the evolution to take three to five years. Old Liu wouldn’t blindly trust Su Ping just because of the Wanmu Wolf’s successful evolution. After all, although the Wanmu Wolf’s evolution was incomplete, there were aspects that could serve as references.\nHowever, the evolution of a mutated Pet Beast was a complex process. It required finding the evolutionary direction, clarifying the path, determining the details, and meeting all necessary conditions. If it were that simple, mutated Pet Beasts wouldn’t be so rare, nor would they be synonymous with high risk and high reward.\nNow, after three months, Su Ping had come to tell him to help his mutated Paperman complete its evolution?\nIn truth, Su Ping, seeing Old Liu’s startled face, was still struggling with whether to tell him about the Paperman’s discovery. But looking at him, he was really afraid that Old Liu’s little heart couldn’t take it.\nAnd it had to be said, the matter concerning regular Papermen was significant. Su Ping was also unsure about it. The matter of cultivation for the Special Beast Taming Forces, which Zhao Deguang had mentioned to him, was still lingering in his mind.\nIf possible, I should make it public after I’ve finished that matter,\nSu Ping thought.\nIt wouldn’t be too late then.\nCould others discern clues from my little paper figure? Possible, but difficult.\nFirstly, the little paper figure was a mutation; mutated Pet Beasts were inherently different from regular Pet Beasts. Secondly, even if someone possessed a talent similar to the Eye of Truth, it was not an ability to be wielded casually. If the Pet Beast itself resisted, others could not spy on it. In this case, even if someone spied, they would only see the little paper figure itself. After all, ordinarily, no one would examine the sword held by a Paperman. To most people, that was just a part of the Paperman.\nAfter receiving an affirmative response from Su Ping, Old Liu pursed his lips and then nodded. \"A Beast Tamer specialized in Sword-type Pet Beasts, or other similar humanoid Swordsman Pet Beasts? And preferably one that can strike without reservation? Let me think...\"\nOld Liu stroked his chin and quickly thought of something. \"Your Pet Beast’s battles... it doesn’t matter if it wins or loses, right?\"\nSu Ping shook his head, telling the truth. \"I don’t know. That’s why I asked you for help, so we can try more options!\"\n\"Well then...\" Old Liu nodded and made a phone call. \"Hello, Hu Yue? Yes, yes, it’s me. I need your help with something. Are you at the dojo or at the Association now? Oh? That’s perfect. Come directly to the simulation battle room on the second floor. I have something to discuss.\"\nAfter hanging up, Old Liu stood up. \"Let’s go!\"\nFollowing Old Liu, Su Ping curiously asked, \"Old Liu, who was that?\"\n\"Heh, the young master of the Linzhou Spirit Fox Dojo, Hu Yue. His family’s inherited Pet Beast, which they also cultivate, is the Spirit Fox Sword. Although in recent years, Artifact Pet Beasts have become less popular and the Spirit Fox Dojo’s research has shifted towards fox-type Pet Beasts, the Spirit Fox Sword is still Hu Yue’s primary Pet Beast. It may not be his strongest, but it’s definitely good enough!\"\nSu Ping’s eyes lit up. The simulation battle room was obviously different from the combat arenas in the hall downstairs. Old Liu confidently approached the nearby controller and pressed a few buttons. The massive battle room transformed as if it were alive, changing from an ordinary arena into a bamboo grove clearing in an instant.\nSoon after, the man called Master Hu finally arrived. This was a man who looked to be around thirty, pale-faced, wearing black-rimmed glasses. He had a slender, bookish appearance, not at all like a dojo master.\n\"President Liu!\"\n\"Hu Yue, I need your help with something. Su Ping needs a Sword-type Pet Beast for a battle. I remember your Spirit Fox Sword once had the strength of Commander Tenth Rank, right? Limit its strength a bit and have a bout with Su Ping’s Pet Beast.\"\n\"Su Ping?\" Hu Yue looked towards the figure beside him. Su Ping hurriedly reached out his hand.\n\"Hello, Senior Hu!\"\nHu Yue nodded, shook hands with Su Ping, and smiled. \"Hello, Su Ping! What’s the realm of your Pet Beast?\"\n\"Uh... I guess it’s Elite First Rank!\"\n\"Alright, then I’ll limit Hu Hu to Elite First Rank!\" Hu Yue appeared quite agreeable.\nSu Ping hesitated. \"Actually, never mind Elite First Rank. Elite Peak would be fine...\"\n\"Ah, Su Ping, you don’t understand,\" Hu Yue said. \"Without my restrictions, my Pet Beast is quite prideful. It won’t hold back and will go all out...\"",

If anything comes up, I’ll call out to Hu Hu right away...\"\nAfter hearing Su Ping and Liu Fuhai’s request, Hu Yue entered the bamboo forest. With a flash of light in her hand, a strange long sword appeared there! This was a crimson long sword, and on its body was a lifelike pattern of a fox.\n\"Su Ping, would your Pet Beast fight against my Spirit Fox Sword’s Sword Spirit, or do you wish to fight me holding the sword?\" Hu Yue asked.\nAfter glancing at the Spirit Fox Sword, Su Ping decided, \"Let’s fight purely against the Sword Spirit!\"\nArtifact Pet Beasts generally have these two methods of combat after reaching a certain Level. One is controlled personally by the owner; the other is by a Sword Spirit evolved from it.\n\"Great! Hu Hu, come forth! Limit your strength to Elite Fifth Tier!\" Hu Yue nodded, tossed the Spirit Fox Sword into the sky. Her figure then retreated to the edge of the bamboo forest.\nSu Ping uttered no more unnecessary words. A similar gleam of light burst forth in front of him! Qian Yi made a brilliant entrance.\nIn a flash, everyone’s gaze, including Vice President Liu’s, was fixed on the small paper figure. He had only heard of Su Ping forming a contract with a Paperman but had never before seen what this mutated Paperman looked like. Now that he saw it, he couldn’t help but squint.\nThe little paper figure, only as tall as an average person’s thigh, wore a conical hat and had three sheaths—almost as tall as itself—stuck in its back, looking extremely odd. However, it had to be said that such a Paperman truly drew attention.\n\"AWOO AWOO!\"\nA sound came from the crimson Spirit Fox Sword in the sky. In the next moment, Su Ping watched as a fiery red, phantom fox emerged from the sword. It opened its mouth and bit the hilt of the Spirit Fox Sword, holding it firmly. The Spirit Fox held the sword in its mouth.\nThe little Paperman buzzed with excitement, finally seeing a sword in its opponent’s hand. \"Wow! (This is... a duel of Swordsmen!)\"\nYet, the Spirit Fox Sword’s Hu Hu merely glanced disdainfully at this odd Paperman.\nJust a mere Elite First Tier Paperman, and it dares speak of a Swordsman’s duel? Though my power has been limited to Elite Fifth Tier by my master, that’s only in terms of energy and output. My Commander Level Skills are still intact! Defeating such a small fry shouldn’t be a problem.\nHence, Hu Hu merely gave the little Paperman a disdainful look.\nSwordsman?\nThe phantom Sword Spirit shook its head.\nVery well, since that’s the case, I might as well show this ignorant little Paperman, who has no idea what a sword truly is, what a real Swordsman is!\nWith that thought, a fiery red ripple slowly emerged from Hu Hu and the Spirit Fox Sword, as if they were enveloped in flames. And on the little Paperman’s face, a change appeared: the symbol of an ’A’, like from a playing card.\n\"Eh? Su Ping, your Paperman is indeed quite interesting!\" Vice President Liu remarked, his eyebrows raised with interest as he saw the playing card symbol on Qian Yi’s face.\nSu Ping didn’t respond because, in the next moment, Hu Hu had already made its move within the bamboo forest simulation battle room. Despite the strength restriction of Elite Fifth Tier, just as Hu Yue had said, her Sword-type Pet Beast never held back and always launched full-force attacks!\nCLANG CLANG!\nThe clear sound echoed loudly within the battle room. The Thunder Sword in Qian Yi’s hand quickly blocked Hu Hu’s attack, and Qian Yi swiftly retreated. Its face, marked with the ’A’, showed no signs of fluctuation—the so-called ’poker face of a Swordsman’.\n\"Thunder Element?\" Liu Fuhai murmured, raising his eyebrows slightly.\nBut the very next moment, before he could take a closer look, the Paperman shot forward. Yet, it was still just an ordinary strike; Qian Yi did not hasten to use any Skills.\nIt was rare to encounter a fellow Swordsman, and Qian Yi’s excitement for battle was greatly ignited. Though Qian Yi showed no outward expression, Su Ping could sense through their soul connection that it was relishing the fight.\nRelishing the duel with a Swordsman!\nAt that moment, a pure white light once again flashed across Qian Yi!\nOld Liu saw the light and was visibly taken aback. \"Is it really about to evolve right now?\" he wondered.\nHowever, in the next moment, the Thunder Sword, glowing with electrical sparks, was already chopping down towards Hu Hu.\nCLANG CLANG CLANG CLANG!\nAt that moment, a Paperman and a fox phantom intertwined in the battle room like interlacing shadows. For a while, these two non-human Pet Beasts, both of whom could be called Swordsmen, actually fought on equal footing!?\n\"WOO-HOO! (Powerful opponent! Qian Yi acknowledges you!)\" Qian Yi’s voice declared.\nBut this only served to provoke Hu Hu.\nWho needs recognition from an oddball like you? I am Miss Hu Hu, a Peak Command Sword Artifact Pet Beast! A mere Paperman fighting on equal terms with me? This is an insult!\nSuddenly, amidst the sharp glint of the sword’s edge, an ear-piercing AWOO AWOO! from Hu Hu rang out! The next moment, a strand of fiery red sword glow wreathed the Spirit Fox Sword, like the tail flame of a brilliant comet streaking across the sky. The surrounding air temperature shot up suddenly. Clearly, everyone knew Hu Hu was about to get serious.",

      "content": "Chapter 255: Chapter 156: Lightning Flashes! Qian Yi Evolves!_4\nSu Ping nodded in satisfaction.\nWithout using Skills, to fight a Sword Artifact-type Pet Beast suppressing its strength to the elite Fifth Rank and not be at a disadvantage was an impressive feat.\nThe combat prowess of the little Paperman was indeed remarkable.\nHowever, what pleased him even more was the Light of Evolution flickering incessantly on the little Paperman’s body at this moment. It was much faster than before.\nThis signified that the little Paperman’s urge to Evolve had been awakened at the fastest pace amidst this very battle.\nOld Liu and Hu Yue both let out a long sigh of relief. They had never anticipated this. Even though the Spirit Fox Sword, with its power suppressed to the elite Fifth Rank, wasn’t at a point to declare immediate victory, it should have been able to dominate the little Paperman in combat, shouldn’t it? But now it seemed that was not the case.\nVice President Liu cast a complex glance at the young man.\nIndeed, perhaps only his own Pet Beasts could be nurtured by him into such freaks!\nWere the previous Wanmu Wolf and the rest of their research merely superfluous demonstrations for outsiders?\nYet, just at this moment, Vice President Liu frowned slightly—not because of the battle, but because his cellphone had suddenly started ringing. He shifted his displeased gaze away from the battle, looking at the incoming call, which made his frown deepen. After thinking it over, he gave Su Ping a look and stepped out of the combat room, entering the lounge outside.\nSu Ping paid it no mind. At this time, nothing seemed as important as the little Paperman Qian Yi’s Evolution.\nThe little Paperman’s poker face remained calm, without a hint of fluctuation.\nThe battleground was tense. Even the little Paperman could feel the temperature in the air surging intensely. Its paper body seemed to singe for a moment, but soon, a light slowly enveloped its entire form.\nYet at this moment, the terrifying surge from the Spirit Fox Sword made the little Paperman’s body stiffen on the spot. Even its Thunder Sword seemed to have been sheathed at some unknown point.\nHowever, at this moment, the electric glints on the little Paperman’s body sparkled even more brightly, as if it were a child of lightning, wrapped in thunder.\nThis is...\nEven the usually detached Hu Yue narrowed his eyes and stared intently at the little Paperman, poised to strike. At this moment, he could even feel an exceedingly dangerous sharpness emanating from this little Paperman, a sharpness that could cut through anything. Coupled with this was a force compressed to its absolute limit, ready to erupt!\nWeren’t Papermen said to be the weakest of the Necromancy Series?\nHu Yue cast a peculiar glance at Su Ping.\nNo wonder President Liu values this young man so highly. It’s said he possesses extraordinary Talent with Wolf Pets, and now, it seems his Talent in the Necromancy System is not weak either!\nHowever, he was not given much time to ponder.\n\"You’re very strong! How about becoming Qian Yi’s sword?\"\nThis statement, which sounded like a challenge, made Hu Hu’s temper flare even more.\nFinally, the little Paperman moved. It even moved simultaneously with Hu Hu, who had also unleashed her full strength. But at that moment, the speed at which it burst forth was even faster than Hu Hu, who was biting the hilt of her long sword!\nBOOM!\nWas it a blade of sword light, or lightning? In the instant the little Paperman exploded into action, a straight line was cleaved before the two observers.\nSubsequently, a heavy thud resounded!\nBANG!\nIt was the sound of blades clashing.\nThe next moment, as Hu Yue watched in disbelief, his Spirit Fox Sword traced a lofty parabolic arc through the air, sent flying instantly. This strike shattered the spectral illusion formed by Hu Hu’s Sword Spirit!\nROAR!\nAn enraged roar echoed through the combat room. Hu Hu’s figure reassembled in the air. The Sword Spirit lacked a physical form, dependent on the Sword Device itself for existence. Therefore, the might of this strike had indeed dispersed Hu Hu’s Sword Spirit, but it inflicted no real harm. Nonetheless, without a doubt, it was a monumental disgrace for Hu Hu to have an opponent like this inflict such an effect.\nThe entire Spirit Fox Sword turned into flames in that moment and smashed down from the heavens!\nYet, the little Paperman still didn’t dodge or evade. Moreover, its poker face continued to speak!\n\"Lightning... Second Flash!\"\nBOOM!\nAnother sound, like thunder exploding beside their ears, rang out. The little Paperman’s body flew out again, intertwining directly with the sword of Flame descending from the sky.\nCLANG!\nA grating sound of metal clashing against metal resounded. Hu Hu’s Spirit Fox Sword staggered. Finally, a look of disbelief appeared in Hu Hu’s eyes.\nHowever, this was clearly not the end! Qian Yi’s combat intelligence was almost top-tier. Su Ping had known this since he first met Qian Yi. Its understanding of battle allowed it to judge the best course of action at any given moment.\nTherefore, almost before the Spirit Fox Sword could react, a sound similar to the previous one rang out once again.\n\"Lightning... Third Flash!\"\nIts voice was comical, but no one dared to underestimate it in the slightest. As it cried out, the flashes of electricity shot past again!\nCLANG! Another impact.\nThis time, Hu Hu and the Spirit Fox Sword could no longer hold on and were sent flying out of the sky. And at the same time, the light on the little Paperman’s body seemed to finally reach an unprecedented limit!\n\"Four Flashes!\"\n\"Five Flashes!\"\n\"...\"\nIn the entire combat room, those flashes of lightning were like crisp, straight lines. With each flash, the Spirit Fox Sword stayed airborne a little longer.\nOne-Word Electric Sword’s Consecutive Lightning Flashes!\nThis was the little Paperman’s greatest achievement during this time, aside from the Qian Yi Whirlwind. By controlling the Energy outflow for temporary activations of the One-Word Electric Sword, it could greatly reduce its Energy consumption without significantly diminishing its power. This was the little Paperman’s understanding of swordplay!\nFor Qian Yi, this was just a minor test of skill. But, undoubtedly, it was already enough.\nBecause at this moment, the Sword Spirit Hu Hu on the Spirit Fox Sword was completely numb. Not just mentally, but physically, too.\nWho could tell her why a sword made of paper could also make her feel so numb?\nAt this moment, Hu Hu, locked within the Spirit Fox Sword and relying on the sword’s body to protect herself, only wanted to tell her idiotic owner,\nWhat the hell were you thinking, letting me, Miss Hu Hu, use only Fifth Rank elite strength against such an opponent? Fight this kind of freak using only Fifth Rank elite strength?\nFinally, the flashing sword tip stopped moving as quickly as thunder in the room. The little Paperman, whether due to Energy depletion or some other reason, stood still, not moving a step. And it was during this breather that the Spirit Fox Sword, no longer daring to fight the freakish little Paperman, instantly flew back into Hu Yue’s arms. It emitted whimpering sounds, filled with both aggrievance and anger.\nBut at this time, the focus of the two men was not on it.\nBecause at the same time, the Light of Evolution on the little Paperman suddenly flared, rising into the sky! However, compared to the Evolution of other Pet Beasts, this beam of light seemed relatively weak.\nHmm?\nSu Ping’s brows furrowed, but Hu Yue quickly realized, \"Quickly give it some supplemental Energy resources! Its own Energy is temporarily insufficient to support direct Evolution!\"\nSu Ping then reacted. Without a second thought, he retrieved the ’Frozen Soul Fire’—a Monarch Level Necromancy Series resource he had kept in his Beast Taming Space for emergencies—and threw it to the little Paperman.\nThe little Paperman swallowed it in one bite, simultaneously sheathing its Thunder Sword.\nThe next moment, the true Light of Evolution soared upward.\nMeanwhile, Liu Fuhai, who had just finished his phone call, walked back in. Then, seeing the Light of Evolution soaring into the sky, he took a moment to react.",

Jianxin, Flying Immortal!\nEvolved?\nLiu Fuhai blinked.\nHe had just stepped out to answer a phone call, and it evolved just like that?\nDamn it! As expected, nothing good ever happens when Mu Yu returns. He just got back, and he already made me miss such an important event!\nLiu Fuhai turned to Su Ping. \"Has it finished evolving?!\"\nSu Ping also revealed a satisfied smile. \"This... should be considered so, right?\"\nThe Light of Evolution soared into the sky, then slowly enveloped the little Paperman, shrouding it in a large Light Cocoon. It seemed as if an unprecedented, mythical creature, one never before seen from ancient times to the present, was hatching.\nIn fact, it was indeed so.\nSu Ping slowly exhaled, the anticipation in his eyes nearly spilling out.\nHow exciting!\nThis was the cultivation and evolution of his very first Pet Beast. Although Old Sha’s Wanmu Wolf had also undergone evolution, that was first discovered by Sun Chaoju and then perfected with the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas. Paperman Qian Yi, however, was truly nurtured step-by-step by Su Ping himself from the very beginning. From the initial discovery, Realm enhancement, Paper Body Control, the mutated Sword Body comprehended after its Realm increased, to the later Sword Technique Skills—it could be said that more effort had been poured into the little Paperman than even Xiao Qing.\nAnd now, the time had come to reap the rewards of this effort.\nAt this moment, nobody wasted words. Even Hu Yue, standing beside them holding his Spirit Fox Sword, stared unblinkingly at the huge Light Cocoon shrouded in the Light of Evolution. Everyone present knew that after the Light of Evolution erupted, they wouldn’t have to wait too long.\nIndeed, they didn’t have to wait long. After only about twenty minutes, the light gradually receded, and within the Light Cocoon, a brand-new figure slowly emerged.\nIn the faint light, it was still a humanoid figure.\nClearly, the little Paperman’s appearance hasn’t changed much?\nHowever, just as Su Ping was about to take a closer look, his face suddenly flushed red. His boiling spiritual power erupted like scalding water, causing the colors in his vision to seemingly invert and the world around him to become hallucinatory!\nQuick to react, Liu Fuhai hurriedly supported Su Ping, who was on the verge of fainting. Then, he felt the terrifying surge of spiritual power erupting from Su Ping! Liu Fuhai looked towards the focus of Su Ping’s gaze, shocked.\nThis mutated Paperman that evolved... what a significant improvement!\nhe thought.\nThe extent of Su Ping’s spiritual power breakthrough is somewhat beyond my expectations!\nThat’s right; this single evolution of Qian Yi had catapulted Su Ping’s spiritual power Realm straight from Elite Fourth Rank to Elite Sixth Rank! Even though his spiritual power had already been on the cusp of advancing, this consecutive increase still caught Su Ping by surprise.\nHowever, one can only imagine, if the feedback to the master’s progression is so substantial, just how exaggerated must the Pet Beast’s improvement be?\nAfter slightly stabilizing his chaotic and turbulent spiritual power, Su Ping finally turned his gaze towards the center of the field where the light had faded. The evolved little Paperman finally appeared before his eyes.\nIt was still the same little Paperman as before; however, the slight difference in appearance was that a peculiar cloak now adorned its back, and its robes seemed fuller. At the same time, the three scabbards that the little Paperman had previously folded for its swords were now a single, much larger Sword Box, housing all three Paper Swords. However, the conical hat on its head and its papery body had apparently remained unchanged.\nBut for some reason, at this moment, the little Paperman gave Su Ping an extremely special feeling, as if surrounded by an aura, immediately possessing a unique, ethereal quality.\nSu Ping was a bit slow to react. He simply used the Eye of Truth to look at Qian Yi, who had changed so much that he was somewhat unrecognizable:\n[Paper Immortal Swordsman (Contracted)]\n[Attribute: Sword, Undead]\n[Current Level: Elite Ninth Order]\n[Racial Potential: First Stage Monarch]\n[Skills: Paper Body Folding (Proficient), Jinge Technique (Perfection), Sword Soul (Special), Accelerated Casting (Proficient), Mutated Paper Body Control (Proficiency), Mutated Sword Body (Proficiency), One-Word Electric Sword (Proficiency), Qian Yi Whirlwind (Proficiency), Mutated Sword Heart (Beginner), Flying Immortal (Beginner)]\nElite Ninth Order!?\nAlthough Su Ping had been prepared, he couldn’t help but draw a sharp breath.\nNo wonder I advanced by two Great Realms! Such a huge advancement, such an immense increase—no form of cultivation could possibly compare to it!\nPaper Immortal Swordsman?\nSu Ping looked at Qian Yi, who had become remarkably ethereal, and couldn’t deny the name was indeed apt. Even the attributes reflected by the Eye of Truth had changed, shifting from the previous ’Gold’ to what belonged to the ’Sword’ category within the Metal Element.\nOf course, Level was one aspect and appearance another, but the most important thing was undoubtedly the skills the little Paperman gained after its promotion. Not only were some of its previous skills enhanced, but it also gained two new ones.\n[Mutated Sword Heart (Beginner): Passive ability. With the heart of a swordsman, it can exhibit 120% of the effect of sword-type skills!\nMutated Effect: Greatly enhances control over sword-related actions, allowing it to multitask. Also, it can actively unleash its full power, causing the next sword technique’s effect to double!]\nAlthough it was a Mutated Skill, compared to the Paperman’s Mutated Sword Body, this skill certainly fell a bit short. However, its effects were extensive and acted directly upon Qian Yi itself. Simple, but it could be considered a jack-of-all-trades! Su Ping was quite satisfied.\n[Flying Immortal (Beginner): By adjusting its body, it can achieve a certain ability to hover and fly. Simultaneously, it can activate the Flying Immortal effect, significantly increasing its speed by ignoring wind resistance, and achieve a degree of Elementalization, allowing it to ignore a great deal of physical attacks.]\nHoly moly?\nSu Ping blinked. Then, in the next moment, without any command from him, a crisp sound emitted.\n\"WAH!\"\nThen, under the watchful eyes of the three people present, the newly evolved Paperman leaped vigorously. The cape behind it made a series of RUSTLES, and then, to Su Ping’s astonishment, it transformed into something akin to a paper airplane’s gliding wing.\nNext, Qian Yi floated playfully here and there in front of him.\nQian Yi chirped excitedly, \"WAH! I can fly now!\"\nRight. The impressive aura and stylish temperament from just after the evolution completely crumbled. Not a trace remained.\nSu Ping pursed his lips, pretending not to see the strange looks from Hu Yue and Vice President Liu. He continued to examine Qian Yi’s changes. Soon, he noticed other differences. The rest of the skills were nothing special; even if their skill levels had increased, the extent and effect of the improvements weren’t significant. But what truly made him slightly taken aback was one skill he had never expected.\n[Sword Soul (Special): Special Skill, cannot be upgraded. A Sword Soul born purely for the sword, it has a great sensitivity to any sword-related items. Other effects are unknown.]\nThe previous Sword Soul Mark had become a true ’Sword Soul’. Even after the Paperman’s evolution was complete, this Sword Soul was no longer just a purely ineffective embellishment. Instead, at this very moment, it had become a skill with a genuine effect.\nSo, does this mean...\nSu Ping suddenly remembered what the Sword Spirit had said in the Fengdu Sword King’s Secret Realm. The effect of the Sword Intent Origin could allow a true Sword Soul Pet Beast, upon reaching the Commander Level, to comprehend the Super-Rank Skill ’Sword Intent’!\nA Super-Rank Skill!\nSu Ping’s eyes lit up with excitement.\nIf Paperman could grasp a Super-Rank Skill while at the Commander Level, what would its future hold? He dared not imagine it.\nIt was just a pity that while these two new skills from the evolution were quite useful, Su Ping still felt a bit unsatisfied.\nIts Racial Potential actually reached the Monarch Level! Logically, it should have gained three to four more skills!\nBut after giving it some thought, Su Ping understood. Generally, a Paperman’s evolution would occur at the Peak Commander Level. As for why its final Racial Potential could reach the Monarch Level, it was very likely because, at the very end, he had the little fellow consume Monarch-Level resources to replenish its energy. Therefore, Paperman had only acquired two additional skills this time. However, with its Mutated Sword Body, as long as Paperman had enough swords, it probably wouldn’t lack combat-oriented Sword Technique Skills. This was evident from the fact that the two skills it gained after evolving were not direct combat skills.\nThinking this, Su Ping relaxed.\nMeanwhile, within the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, the Catalog entry for Paperman opened. A prompt then appeared!\n[Mutated Paperman completes individual evolution, unlocking Evolutionary Body ’Paper Immortal Swordsman’, earned 1500 Catalog Experience Points!]\n[Gained substantial understanding of the reasons behind Paperman’s mutation; analysis of the reason for Paperman’s mutation completed!]\nSu Ping exhaled.\nHe had long known the reason for the Paperman’s mutation; what need was there for analysis?\nHowever, to satisfy his curiosity, Su Ping still merged his consciousness into the Paperman’s Catalog entry. Since no additional Experience Points would be consumed, taking a look couldn’t hurt.\nBut this look made him slightly startle:\n[Mutation Direction for Paperman 1: Sword Soul Mutation]\n[Using the Spiritual Level Resource ’Soul Seed’, using the Spiritual Level Resource ’Sword Intent Origin’, with Paperman as the body, implanting both allows Paperman to give birth to a complete soul, which will be a Sword Soul with remarkable potential...]\n[Mutation Direction for Paperman 2: Metal Element Jinge Technique Mutation]\n[After its paper body is pierced by a Sword Artifact-type Pet Beast between ten thousand to one hundred thousand times, there’s a certain chance of completing the mutation during this process.]\nSo Paperman’s mutation wasn’t just a single type? Was it a combination of Sword Soul and Metal Element? Its Jinge Technique came about this way? Pierced ten thousand to one hundred thousand times?\nAt that moment, looking at Paperman floating to and fro in the air, Su Ping’s gaze softened immensely.\nJust then, Hu Yue, who was standing by, spoke up, \"Su Ping, do you want to test out your Pet Beast’s combat strength after its evolution?\"\nSu Ping was startled, then he nodded gladly.\nOnly Hu Hu, the Sword Spirit, which had retracted into the Spirit Fox Sword, emerged again from the blade. It looked at its master with scrutinizing eyes, thinking,\nDoes this damn Beast Tamer want me dead?",

      "content": "Chapter 257: Chapter 158: Pet Beast Breeding Knows No Borders? But Beast Tamers Do!\nIn the Breeder Association, inside Liu Fuhai’s office.\nSeveral figures were seated there, two of them wearing expressions of impatience.\n\"Breeder Mu Hang, is this how your Jianghai Breeder Association treats its guests?\" the blond-haired, blue-eyed Caucasian man asked, somewhat displeased.\nThey had been waiting here for nearly an hour. Liu Fuhai had sounded so accommodating over the phone, yet he still hadn’t returned.\nMu Hang glanced at the man. Of the three people present, Mu Yu was his father. Even if he didn’t agree with some of his father’s practices, he couldn’t say much. Chris was a disciple his father had accepted from across the ocean, and he always respectfully addressed Mu Hang as \"Senior Brother.\" Naturally, Mu Hang couldn’t be too harsh with him either. As for this fellow, he was merely one of the envoys stationed at the Eagle Country’s embassy in the Dragon Nation. What right did he have to complain?\nTherefore, Mu Hang shot him a glance and said, \"Mr. Harman, if you’re impatient, you can leave first.\"\nHarman stiffened, choked by the response. He could only glance at Mu Yu, whose expression remained calm, but he didn’t say anything further.\nOn the other hand, Chris also said unhappily, \"Teacher, what is Master Liu doing?\"\nMu Yu replied indifferently, \"He said it was about Breeder Su Ping, whom he had just met. It’s probably related to Pet Beast breeding, right?\"\nHarman snorted derisively. \"It can’t be about that Paperman, can it?\"\nMu Hang glanced at these people.\nDamn, they actually hit the nail on the head,\nhe thought.\nThe others might not know, but Mu Hang actually knew quite a bit about Su Ping. His main source of information was Sun Chaoju, that big mouth. Regarding Su Ping’s Paperman cultivation, the subsequent Wanmu Wolf, and the rumor that Su Ping had actually formed a contract with a mutated Paperman as a Pet Beast—details unknown to others—Mu Hang had indeed heard whispers of these things.\nTherefore, even though Mu Hang knew what the Paperman meant to his father, he still said, \"Not all Papermen are the same. Su Ping’s mutated Paperman has potential!\"\nHmm?\nAt this remark, even Mu Yu looked at Mu Hang with suspicion. \"A mutated Paperman? What, that Su Family boy actually has a mutated one?\"\nMu Hang nodded.\nAlthough he was the son of a Senior Necromancy Breeder, his chosen path was different from his father’s, and he didn’t know much about Undead Pet Beasts. However, Mu Yu had faced such significant setbacks because of Papermen in the past that his understanding of them was naturally far beyond that of ordinary people. When research into ordinary Papermen yielded no progress, Mu Hang had turned his attention to mutated Papermen. However, after all these years, he had only encountered a few. Even when such specimens were found, research into their mutation directions hadn’t proven very significant.\nCompared to Mu Yu’s son, Mu Hang, Chris undoubtedly understood his teacher’s thoughts better. He said directly, \"A mutated Paperman? For such precious experimental material to be in the hands of a mere Dragon Nation citizen is too much of a waste, isn’t it? Senior Brother Mu Hang, could you discuss a price with that Su Ping and see if we can buy it?\"\nMu Hang frowned. What he hated most was their attitude towards Pet Beasts.\n\"Su Ping’s mutated Paperman is his Contracted Beast. It’s not for sale!\"\n\"This...\" Chris glanced at Mu Yu beside him.\nAs expected, even Mu Yu was quite intrigued. \"Little Hang, could you talk to Breeder Su and see if I can join the research for a bit? Perhaps I can help it complete its Evolution. Hehe, I won’t even charge him a fee for the cultivation and Evolution...\"\nMu Yu was truly interested. After all these years, the Paperman had always been his obsession. He had been imprisoned by the Dragon Nation years ago due to a Paperman Evolution experiment, and only then had he seized the opportunity to join the Eagle Country. Even after arriving across the ocean, he never gave up his research on Papermen. However, he always lacked a clear direction.\nSo, he had a further thought.\nCould I perhaps find a new path by studying mutated Papermen, and then apply those findings back to ordinary Papermen?\nHe had never expected to make such a discovery upon returning to Jianghai this time.\nHowever, before Mu Hang could answer, laughter came from outside the door. \"Hehe, Mu Yu, still can’t let go of your Paperman research, can you!\"\nThe office door was pushed open, and Liu Fuhai entered, followed by Su Ping. The speaker was none other than Liu Fuhai.\nMu Yu stood up and chuckled, \"You old rascal! I come all this way back, and you make me wait this long!\"\n\"Haha, well, something came up. Su Ping’s mutated Paperman completed its Evolution, and he had me go take a look with him...\" Liu Fuhai patted Su Ping beside him, and they sat down on the sofa together.\nSu Ping’s gaze swept across all those present. He was already familiar with Mu Hang, so no need for introductions there. As for the others, Senior Breeder Mu Yu had a gaunt face and pale complexion, perfectly fitting Su Ping’s stereotype of a Necromancy Breeder. As for the other two, the blond-haired, blue-eyed Caucasians, he swept his gaze over them once and couldn’t be bothered to pay them any mind.\nHowever, almost as soon as Liu Fuhai’s words faded, the entire office fell deathly silent.\nEven Mu Yu, the smile still on his face, was visibly stunned.",

But Beast Tamers Do!_2\n\"Mutant Paperman... has it completed its evolution?\"\nMu Yu’s gaze was firmly locked on Su Ping.\nIt made Su Ping involuntarily get goosebumps all over.\nLiu Fuhai, however, did not answer that question and simply crossed his legs.\n\"So, what brings you back this time? Any business?\"\nMu Yu quickly withdrew his gaze from Su Ping, but a fervent look still occasionally flashed in his eyes.\n\"Haha, isn’t it because I was thinking that it’s been so many years since we’ve met, so I specially came back to see you?\"\nLiu Fuhai squinted. He always felt that it wasn’t that simple, but he couldn’t figure out why for the moment.\nMu Yu clearly had no intention of elaborating on this, and his gaze returned to Su Ping.\n\"I’ve heard from Mu Hang that there’s an extraordinary disciple of yours in Jianghai. Now it seems he’s truly remarkable indeed.\"\nLiu Fuhai chuckled.\n\"I can’t really take credit as Su Ping’s teacher. It’s just my luck that Su Ping was born in Jianghai!\"\nIn the past, Liu Fuhai might have boasted in front of others, but now, he truly felt ashamed.\nNot to mention the mutant Paperman, just the embryonic form of the Super-Rank Skill of the Wanmu Wolf made him green with envy.\nMu Yu didn’t mind the old man’s modesty.\nHe watched Su Ping with a smile.\n\"Su Ping, are you researching the evolution of Papermen? I’ve done some research on Papermen myself, so if you have any questions, you can ask me...\"\nIn his view, he was extending a great deal of goodwill.\nAlthough it was purposeful, Mu Yu felt there was nothing wrong with his offer.\nBut Su Ping just smiled faintly, giving a light nod.\nAsk you? Ask you what? Witness your bold proclamations from the early diary entries, then the nonsensical babble in the middle, and then watch as you conduct soul-devouring experiments after a breakdown? Finally, see you leave Dragon Nation with your tail between your legs?\nSu Ping knew people were different. He also understood that choices varied. But understanding didn’t equate to approval.\nHowever, it was clear that Mu Yu wanted to see more than just this attitude from Su Ping.\nHe quickly turned to Liu Fuhai again.\n\"Old Liu, did you just say that Breeder Su’s mutant Paperman has evolved?\"\nLiu Fuhai nodded. \"Mhm.\"\nOf course, he knew what Mu Yu was probably thinking at this moment, but he didn’t care, nor did he have any intention of playing matchmaker.\nHe and Mu Yu had once been the best of friends, but Old Liu knew better than anyone else.\nEven when Mu Yu was imprisoned, Liu Fuhai had visited him frequently, ensuring his life in prison wasn’t much worse than outside.\nBut once the other party left Dragon Nation and joined Eagle Country, Mu Yu was no longer his best friend. He was no better than a stranger, at most.\nWho knew what Mu Yu was up to, returning to Dragon Nation this time?\nClearly, Liu Fuhai knew Mu Yu’s purpose, and so did the few people beside him.\nThe younger Chris laughed.\n\"Breeder Su, you must know that Teacher has always been very interested in Papermen. Now that your mutant Paperman can complete its evolution, it may be of great significance to the Paperman race itself! For the sake of the evolutionary prospects of Papermen, for the development of Necromancy Series breeding, Breeder Su, can you summon your mutant Paperman for us to see and enlighten us all?\"\nFor the evolutionary prospects of Papermen. For the development of Necromancy Series breeding. Two very grand justifications.\nFacing Mu Yu—an elder, Mu Hang’s father, and someone whose diary he had read (though it offered no practical help)—Su Ping felt some connection, however tenuous.\nTherefore, even though Su Ping had no particular fondness for him, there was no reason to speak rudely.\nBut clearly, facing this presumptuous foreigner, Su Ping was not in such a good mood.\nHe simply glanced at Chris, and under Mu Yu’s expectant gaze, shook his head.\n\"The little guy is still adapting to his abilities; let’s not bother.\"\nQian Yi’s situation was special. Moreover, the evolutionary principles of ordinary Papermen were actually encapsulated within Qian Yi.\nIt wasn’t that Su Ping was being overly protective of his own discovery, but showing his achievements to his own people, like Old Liu and Hu Yue, wasn’t much of an issue, even if it exposed something.\nBut what if these foreigners got a hold of it?\nIn Pet Beast research, the initial direction of research can often be a decisive key.\nWhat if his findings were plagiarized? Albeit unlikely, why should he take a risk just to satisfy the curiosity of this bunch? Who the hell do you think you are?\nSu Ping’s blunt refusal made Chris’s face darken, and Mu Yu also lost face.\nMu Yu finally couldn’t hold back.\n\"Breeder Su, the pursuit of Pet Beast breeding knows no borders! Breeders also aim to advance humanity’s Beast Taming further!\"\nLiu Fuhai had been silent all along. Even at this moment, he only frowned without speaking, his gaze also turning towards Su Ping.\nBut Su Ping just smiled.\n\"Perhaps. But Beast Tamers do have borders. Of course, that may not matter to you, but for me, some things are destined to mean we’re not on the same path!\"\nSu Ping smiled faintly, remaining indifferent to Chris and the other white man from beginning to end.\nA hint of a smile touched Liu Fuhai’s lips. He was clearly very pleased with Su Ping’s response.\nSu Ping stood up.\n\"Since Old Liu, you still have matters to attend to, I won’t overstay my welcome!\"",

But Beast Tamers Do!_3\nHaving said that, he turned to leave.\nBut having only taken a few steps, he seemed to remember something. He turned his head back; under Mu Yu’s somewhat surprised gaze, he pondered for a moment and took out a book.\nIt was none other than the Paperman Cultivation Journal that Sun Chaoju had given him.\n\"This belongs to you, doesn’t it, Breeder Mu? I must admit, I admire your professional attitude, but forgive me for saying I cannot agree with your cultivation methods! I hope you can make further progress in the lands across the ocean,\" Su Ping said.\nMu Yu was slightly taken aback as he looked at the journal handed to him. He didn’t take it, but instead, raised his head and gave Su Ping an interested look, his slightly narrowed eyes showing no clear emotion.\nHowever, Mu Yu eventually smiled faintly and accepted the journal.\n\"Then I’ll take your kind words to heart. And, that pendant looks quite nice,\" Mu Yu said.\nSu Ping looked down slightly, glancing at the sword-shaped pendant from which he had taken the cultivation journal.\nIt was none other than the Space Device of the Fengdu Sword King.\nSu Ping smiled, not minding it at all.\nHowever, it was just then that Vice President Liu finally spoke up, \"Su Ping, go have something to drink first. I won’t be busy for too long, and we can have a chat later...\"\n...\nJust as Vice President Liu had said, he indeed didn’t spend too much time with Mu Yu.\nAfter a little over half an hour, he came to find Su Ping again.\nMeanwhile, Mu Yu and his two companions walked out of the Breeder Association building.\n—Mu Hang had already left when Su Ping did.\nMu Yu’s expression was calm; he didn’t seem to care at all about the cold reception he had received at the Breeder Association.\nHowever, the fact that the two Caucasians beside him didn’t dare to speak even a word showed that Mu Yu’s mood must be quite bad.\nThe evolutionary cultivation of the mutated Paperman.\nThe rejection by a mere junior, and the disdain for him evident in that junior’s words and tone.\nFurthermore, the one he once considered his best friend showed him no regard, not even bothering with basic superficial courtesies.\nThis made Mu Yu, who had actually come back wanting to catch up with an old friend, feel like a clown.\nHowever, the old and shrewd Mu Yu was not as angered as the two had imagined. Instead, he was puzzled.\nIndeed, once in the vehicle, his puzzlement could no longer be masked. He even muttered softly,\n\"It really looks like that thing. A coincidence? But it’s also unlikely; it lacks that aura. It must be a coincidence, or just one of many fakes...\"\nSupporting his chin, he no longer cared about the previous Paperman incident.\nChris, beside him, carefully asked, \"Master, what thing were you talking about?\"\nMu Yu gave him a sidelong glance and replied indifferently, \"Don’t ask about things you shouldn’t! You go out first...\"\n\"Oh...\"\nAlthough Chris didn’t understand his master’s meaning, he obediently left the car.\nAfterward, with a thought from Mu Yu, a Spirit Barrier completely sealed the space inside the car. Only then did he look at the Caucasian man beside him.\n\"Harman.\"\n\"Mu Sir! What is it?\"\nA cold light flashed in Mu Yu’s eyes. \"That Su Ping is very interesting. I want three things from him. You go get them for me!\"\nHarman was taken aback, then said with some difficulty, \"Mu Sir, this is Dragon Nation, after all. If I act rashly...\"\nHe hadn’t finished his sentence when Mu Yu’s gaze swept over him. \"After so many years in Dragon Nation, has your brain frozen? I recall you have a rare ’Mind Worm’ Pet Beast, right?\"\n\"...\"\n\"In Dragon Nation, even in the most glamorous cities, there are always people lurking in the grey areas! No one cares about their lives or movements. That kid is merely an elite Beast Tamer...\"\n\"This... Yes, I understand!\"\nHarman nodded. Indeed, compared to Mu Yu, a native of Dragon Nation, he was still far too lacking.\nHowever, what truly chilled Harman’s heart was this Mu Sir’s icy and ruthless nature.\nPerhaps this is the reason this Mu Sir is appreciated and heavily relied upon by that entity?\n\"Remember, leave no trace! The reason Dragon Nation’s security is countless times stronger than Eagle Country’s is because of the omnipresent official forces! So, from now on, do not have any direct contact with Su Ping, understand? Furthermore, when you make your move, you and I must have a strong witness to provide us with an alibi. Also, it must be done quickly.\"\n\"Yes, Mu Sir. What are the three items you require?\"\nMu Yu smiled faintly. \"The Soul Fire of that Genius Breeder, that mutated Paperman, and...\"\nA puzzled look flashed in Mu Yu’s eyes. After a moment’s pause, he continued, \"And that sword-shaped space pendant.\"\nAlthough reason told Mu Yu it was highly unlikely—after all, if that item were real, its significance would be unimaginable. Moreover, there were indeed too few clues. With only a slight resemblance, there was no need to be overly sensitive.\nHowever, Mu Yu’s style was to rather eliminate the wrong person than let a potential target escape.\nAfter all, that item was supposed to have appeared in some Secret Realm. It was clearly impossible for it to be on that young fellow.\nShaking his head, Mu Yu dismissed the thought, a cold glint flashing in the depths of his eyes.\nLiu Fuhai, since you can’t even be bothered with superficial courtesies, don’t blame me for meddling in your affairs!\nObserving the cold glint in the Undead Cultivator’s eyes, Harman involuntarily shivered. \"I understand, rest assured!\"\n\"Go. It would be best to act tonight. Coincidentally, this evening I have to meet with President Qin again; he’s always been keen on joining the ’Heart of Gold’.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 260: Chapter 159: Su Ping Attacked! A Thin Line Between Life and Death!\nBlack Blood’s car window opened. The night wind dissipated the excitement and restlessness Su Ping had felt during the day. Experiencing the different scenery of the night, Su Ping couldn’t help but smile.\nFinally, the evolution is complete.\nThe Paperman’s evolution boosted Su Ping’s confidence in preparing to evolve Xiao Qing as well, raising it to unprecedented levels. Once they both evolved, Su Ping would have sufficient confidence for tomorrow’s professional aptitude test. He didn’t understand what Qin Xiaoxue had meant at the time. However, if things continued to develop this way, his strength might reach an unimaginable level by the mid-year professional aptitude test next year.\nThinking of this, Su Ping grinned, instantly feeling completely satisfied and in high spirits.\n\"Feifei, how’s my driving?!\" he asked Black Blood’s mechanical intelligence.\n\"So amazing! Master, your growth rate astounds Feifei! To think you could increase your speed from twenty kilometers per hour to forty in such a short time! Look, the last bus is already very close to you!\"\nSu Ping said proudly, then quickly eased up on the gas pedal, his heart still pounding a bit from the speed. It had been too fast, making his heart race.\n\"By the way, Feifei, why can’t you merge with a mechanical body like other awakened Mechanical Cores?\"\nThe car’s screen displayed a cartoon image of a big-headed baby doll, Feifei’s virtual avatar. It shook its head.\n\"Feifei doesn’t know either. Perhaps my core material is a bit different from other Hearts of Gold Element! But it doesn’t matter, Feifei can still serve Master from the car system! Plus, this is good too, since I don’t have to fight. Feifei hates fighting the most!\"\nSu Ping smiled slightly. \"Hehe, Feifei doesn’t like fighting?\"\n\"Yes, Feifei is afraid of pain.\"\nSu Ping was taken aback. \"Mechanical Cores can feel pain too?\"\n\"Of course!\" The virtual character on the car screen adopted a scared expression. \"It’s because merging with a mechanical body is so painful that Feifei can’t merge!\"\nMerging with a mechanical body is painful?\nSu Ping scratched his head.\nIs it really that painful? He hadn’t heard Dong Muyun mention this.\nHe indeed knew very little about Mechanical Pet Beasts.\nWhen I have time, I should ask Dong Muyun if Mechanical Cores really fear the pain of merging with a mechanical body.\nHowever, in this moment of distraction, Su Ping suddenly froze. At the same time, Feifei’s voice resounded from inside the car, \"EEK! Master, there’s someone ahead! Hit the brakes, quickly!\"\n\"Damn it!\"\nInstead, Su Ping slammed his foot on the accelerator.\nInstantly, Black Blood shot forward, accelerating from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in 0.9 seconds. Fortunately, this wasn’t an ordinary sports car but an intelligent one. Feifei detected the car wasn’t slowing but lunging forward, and instantly initiated an emergency brake through the intelligent system.\nSCREECH...\nThe friction between the tires and the ground left a ten-meter drag mark on the road.\nSu Ping blinked rapidly, still reeling from the shock, and looked rather speechlessly at the figure not far away. The figure seemed frozen in fear, just standing there.\nSu Ping felt somewhat helpless.\nIt’s the dead of night, on this deserted suburban road, for someone to just pop out like that... who could handle that?\nThe person in front of him, however, seemed so frightened by the incident that they just stood there motionless. Su Ping felt a pang of remorse; after all, he knew he was usually a competent driver.\nIndeed, one shouldn’t get too complacent. The moment you do, you lose your composure.\nSu Ping reflected inwardly, then quickly got out of the car and approached the person. \"Um, are you okay? Do you need to get checked out?\"\nHowever, the moment that figure turned to look at him, Su Ping felt a sensation he had never experienced before. It was like when he was in school and saw the peak Commander-level Pet Beast, an Iron Thorn Over the Mountain, which had been caught in the wild and kept behind a reinforced glass wall. When that Iron Thorn Over the Mountain had stared at him with its cold, triangular eyes, Su Ping had felt as if all his strength was being drained away.\nBecause his biological instincts told him that if that thing pounced, he would undoubtedly die.\nBack then, there was the reinforced glass wall for protection. But this time, there was no barrier whatsoever between him and the being before his eyes!\nIn a split second, almost at that very instant, two beams of light flared simultaneously. The Paperman and another figure appeared almost instantly on the dark street.\nSu Ping quickly backed away, finally seeing what had appeared before him. It was an Evolutionary Body of an Iron Arm Ape: a Steel Arm Ape.\nSu Ping was quite familiar with the Iron Arm Ape. During the Legion tournaments, one Legion had a unit based on Iron Arm Ape Evolutionary Bodies. Their evolved individuals were even Great Strength Vajra Apes, powerful Monarch-level Pet Beasts.\nFortunately, the evolved Iron Arm Ape before him was ’just’ a Steel Arm Ape. As a common Evolutionary Body of the Iron Arm Ape, the Steel Arm Ape had merely gained a further enhancement in strength. Nonetheless, even this Steel Arm Ape caused Su Ping’s pupils to contract with wariness.",

      "content": "Chapter 261: Chapter 159: Su Ping Attacked! A Thin Line Between Life and Death! _2\nThis was a giant ape, as tall as a man. Its black and gray, steel-hard arms were even thicker than an adult man’s waist. This alone was enough to reveal the immense power they contained!\n\"Who are you!?\"\nHowever, it was quite clear that at this moment, neither the steel-armed ape nor its owner would answer that question.\nThe ground seemed to tremble. As the steel-armed ape moved, it was like a tank charging toward Su Ping!\nFortunately, Su Ping had also noticed that the steel-armed ape, though undoubtedly a mature adult, was also at the Commander Level. Its Level, however, was likely between Commander First Stage and Commander Third Stage.\nMoreover, it was clear that this assassin’s actual strength was quite average. Aside from this steel-armed ape, his main combat Pet Beast, he didn’t summon any other Pet Beasts to deliver a fatal blow to Su Ping.\nThis undoubtedly gave Su Ping a chance to breathe.\nAnd... an opportunity to counter-kill!\nThe little Paperman looked at the steel-armed ape—burly yet surprisingly fast—and almost without thinking, its face instantly changed to the familiar ’A’ shape.\nPreviously, Su Ping had often criticized the little fellow’s taste. But at this moment, truly seeing this face, he felt an indescribable sense of security.\nHowever, without a second thought, another flash of light ignited. Xiao Qing, who hadn’t appeared for a long time, also emerged.\nWhen Su Ping had previously broken through to Elite Sixth Rank, Xiao Qing’s strength had also naturally ascended by another rank. Although it couldn’t keep up with Qian Yi—the little Paperman who had completed its evolution and reached Elite Ninth Order—Xiao Qing had now reached Elite Fourth Rank.\nMoreover, with its hard-to-defend-against Poison Type Attribute, even at a lower Level, it could sometimes play a crucial role. And right now, it did.\nXiao Qing, almost immediately understanding the situation, let out a low Wolf Howl. Purple and green vines materialized out of thin air. While they only briefly hindered the steel-armed ape, they still managed to leave several shallow, superficial wounds beneath its fur!\nUnder Su Ping’s command, Xiao Qing swiftly reacted. It suddenly fixed its emerald-green pupils on the man in the black tactical jacket.\nThe man seemed to realize something too. He sneered disdainfully, then actually let out an inhuman roar as his muscles bulged, and his frame suddenly became extremely robust!\nThe Beast Tamer’s special Talent—’Strength Sharing’! This Talent allowed the Pet Beast’s power and stamina to be added to the Beast Tamer. Simultaneously, the Beast Tamer’s own practiced physical strength and power could be reflected back onto the Pet Beast. It was a quite decent and practical Talent, suitable for Beast Tamers who lifted weights and for power or stamina-type Pet Beasts. The activation of this Talent could grant the Beast Tamer combat strength not inferior to that of a Pet Beast for a short time!\nXiao Qing had just lunged when the Beast Tamer sent it flying with a single punch. Fortunately, after a brief pause, Xiao Qing got back up.\nThe next moment, a giant flower bloomed in the middle of the area. Countless intertwining vines densely formed a wall of concentrated toxic gas.\nBut Su Ping paid no heed to this, not even to Qian Yi’s battle. Instead, he quickly took out his cell phone and dialed a number. It was none other than Dong Muyun.\nThe call was answered instantly. Dong Muyun’s side of the call was noisy; she was clearly at some kind of banquet.\nWhen Dong Muyun answered Su Ping’s call, her eyes held a charming smile. However, it vanished completely the instant the call connected.\n\"I’ve been attacked. I’m now about ten kilometers west of Lingxi River Station.\" Su Ping’s words had barely registered before he abruptly ended the call.\nUnimaginable terror and fury flashed in Dong Muyun’s eyes. Almost without thinking, before any of the surrounding company executives could react, Yunning instantly enveloped her entire body. To everyone’s bewilderment, a jet of flame blasted out from a shattered window, soaring into the sky.\nSu Ping let out a long breath, trying his best to calm his racing heart.\nNow, time was on his side. So, he didn’t need to hurry anymore.\nMoreover, from what he could see, the situation seemed to be temporarily stable. Although that Beast Tamer’s strength was considerable, breaking through Xiao Qing’s toxic gas defense line would be quite difficult.\nAnd most importantly, Qian Yi was holding its own! Yes, even when facing a Commander Level steel-armed ape, Qian Yi, at this very moment, had not only blocked it but was even gaining the upper hand!\nSo what if there was a gap of an entire Great Realm?\nFor the first time, Su Ping witnessed Qian Yi’s combat power. After evolving into the Paper Immortal Swordsman, although Qian Yi hadn’t acquired any particularly damaging Skills, both its mutated Sword Heart and the Flying Fairy effect were absolutely absurd among Commander Level Pet Beast abilities! Besides, even without acquiring damaging Skills, the two Swordsmanship styles Qian Yi had created itself were inherently its most suitable combat techniques!\nBOOM! BOOM!\nContinuous thunderous sounds erupted.\nThis not only prevented the steel-armed ape from even touching the little Paperman but also left several new, charred sword marks on its body, in addition to the earlier superficial wounds from the Poison Vine Strangulation. Undoubtedly, the damage from these sword marks was vastly more severe than that from Xiao Qing’s poison vines!",

A Thin Line Between Life and Death! _3\nThis almost made the Iron Arm Ape’s eyes turn red.\nBut, not only could it simply not touch the little Paperman, even if it could, the little Paperman’s Fairy Flight Skill was the nemesis of all physical attacks. Just like how Elementalized Pet Beasts countered physical Pet Beasts. This kind of counter could, much of the time, ignore some disparity in Realm.\nHowever, something Su Ping never expected happened.\nSeeing the situation had reached a deadlock, the Beast Tamer in the black jacket gave an order, and the Iron Arm Ape actually abandoned Qian Yi directly. Ignoring Qian Yi’s rapid attacks, its sturdy arms now bearing several deep, charred wounds that exposed the bone, it charged straight toward Su Ping!\nA chill went through Su Ping’s heart.\nWho on earth wanted him dead this badly?\nAlmost immediately, Su Ping thought of Mu Yu from earlier that day.\nBut how could he dare? This was Dragon Nation!\nSu Ping’s fury was irrelevant; this was a true matter of life and death.\nYet, Su Ping knew he could always trust Qian Yi.\nThe evolved little Paperman, beneath its conical hat—its face instantly changed to a diamond 3.\nThree swords were drawn at once.\nThe Wind Sword plunged into its chest, while the Thunder Sword and Fire Sword were held in its hands. Simultaneously, a dazzling sword light bloomed from the little Paperman’s body!\nMutated Sword Heart!\nThis could double the effect of the next sword-type Skill used!\nUndoubtedly, this was the little Paperman’s true hidden trump card!\nQian Yi Whirlwind!\nInstantly, the revolving Qian Yi, like a spinning top imbued with the power of thunder and fire, appeared behind the Iron Arm Ape. The sharpened edges of the two Paper Swords seemed capable of grinding everything nearby into dust. That included the Iron Arm Ape!\nEven for an Iron Arm Ape that had reached Commander Level, its charging speed significantly decreased at this moment. And the Qian Yi Whirlwind, now in front of it, drew closer and closer!\nFinally, the Iron Arm Ape stumbled, then was suddenly flung backward toward Qian Yi! It was like a piece of raw meat thrown into a rapidly spinning blender. Large amounts of fresh blood and shredded flesh flew from the edges of the swords!\n\"AARGH!\"\nThe painful howl, having just burst through the dark night sky, stopped abruptly!\nThe head of the Iron Arm Ape, minced by the three swords of thunder, wind, and fire, soared into the sky.\nThe spinning little Paperman gradually slowed down.\nThe face that had been a diamond 3 reverted to its usual two-dimensional appearance: (((φ(◎ロ◎;)φ)))\nSu Ping watched the dizzy little Paperman. This time, however, its silver-gray body was stained crimson with the blood and flesh of the Iron Arm Ape at its feet. It presented a particularly stark contrast.\nThe Pet Beast was dead!\nThis was the little Paperman’s first true kill.\nAnd it was also Su Ping’s first true kill!\nSu Ping turned his head to look at the man in the black jacket.\nAs Su Ping expected, the man’s face had turned extremely pale, and he was bleeding from all seven orifices.\nThis was the price for the death of a Soul-Contracted Pet Beast. Even if the Beast Tamer didn’t die, his soul would be gravely wounded!\nHowever, there was not a hint of pity in Su Ping’s eyes. In fact, they were even colder than before.\nThen, he suddenly realized something.\nThe man, who had been almost crazed, suddenly raised his head. A hideous smile spread across his scarred cheek.\nA sensation even more terrifying than before surged through Su Ping’s heart. As if he had realized something, he recalled Xiao Qing and the little Paperman back into the Beast Taming Space with the greatest possible speed.\nHowever, it was clear the man had noticed his actions but was not at all in a hurry. Instead, he simply ripped open his jacket!\nSure enough, strapped to the man’s body was a mechanical countdown timer.\nThere was no question what it was. A Mechanical Weapon! He actually used a Mechanical Weapon! Crazy! Damn it, where on earth did the person behind this find such a lunatic!? Such a suicidal attack... Did they really not fear blowing this whole thing wide open?\nClearly, the man, his face completely smeared with blood, was thoroughly enjoying the sight of Su Ping finally panicking. The countdown on the timer showed only five seconds left!\nWith only five seconds, it was clearly impossible for Su Ping to escape.\nYet, just as Su Ping’s thoughts were racing, a light shone brightly.\nIt was his big toy: Black Blood!\nLights rapidly flickered on Black Blood, as if desperately trying to catch Su Ping’s attention.\nUndoubtedly, it had succeeded—or rather, Feifei had succeeded.\nSu Ping lunged behind the car door, which had already opened automatically, and sprawled in an ungraceful position directly onto the cockpit!\n\"Master, initiating emergency measure: spatial teleportation ability! I have selected the nearest hospital location for you! Farewell, Master!\"\nFeifei, the car’s artificial intelligence, spoke in its familiar voice—the same voice Su Ping had been casually chatting with just ten minutes prior. Its lively voice carried an indescribable vivacity and agility.\nAt this moment, Su Ping’s racing heart finally settled.\nA hair’s breadth from death! This was truly a hair’s breadth from death.\nHe had previously thought that the spatial teleportation ability Dong Muyun had installed was rather pointless. Now, it seemed it had saved his life at this critical moment.\nHowever, Su Ping quickly realized something:\n\"Feifei, what about you and Black Blood?\"\nHowever, before he could receive an answer, the few seconds passed too quickly.\nEverything before his eyes began to blur. These were the ripples and vortices of space. The nighttime highway scene before him slowly disappeared within the ripples.\nIn its place, he found himself in a bustling lobby.\nBut Su Ping was stunned.\nBecause in the final instant of the spatial teleportation, at the other end of that spatial ripple, an incomparably massive explosion thundered not too far in the distance. Boundless flames filled his entire field of vision on the other side of the spatial ripple.\nThe next moment, all of it, including the sound, vanished.\nLooking at the hospital lobby, Su Ping felt dazed for a moment. He was still in the same position he had been in when he lunged into the cockpit. Passersby, moving in and out, gave the young man who had suddenly appeared strange, puzzled looks.\nYet Su Ping paid them no mind; for the first time, his gaze was somewhat vacant.\nHe knew.\nThe Mechanical Core that, just over ten minutes ago, had said it ’feared pain the most,’ the artificial life form that claimed it could serve its master even from within the car...\nFeifei.\nIt had taken his place in that explosion, apparently shattering into pieces along with the supercar.",

Su Ping’s ’Second Grandpa’!\nYunning swept swiftly across the sky.\nFlying at full speed from Linzhou City Center to the highway leading to the suburbs took merely three to five minutes.\nHowever, just as Dong Muyun zipped through the air, a tremendous BOOM detonated right ahead!\nDong Muyun’s face turned extremely pale in that moment.\nYunning, which had enveloped Dong Muyun completely, descended from the sky, ignoring the fierce flames and heatwave still sweeping through.\nIt was utter chaos. A sea of fire met her eyes.\nDong Muyun paid no heed to this. After quickly scanning the scene, she thought without hesitation,\n\"Yunning, quickly dial Su Ping’s number!\"\nThe call connected. To Dong Muyun’s immense relief, it was swiftly answered.\nSu Ping’s voice soon came through the phone.\n\"Hello, Su Ping, are you alright?\"\n\"I’m fine.\"\nThe voice on the other end was indeed very calm, so calm it surprised Dong Muyun.\n\"Sister Yun, could you help me check if Feifei’s Mechanical Core on Black Blood is alright?\"\n\"Sure, where are you now? Do you need me to send someone to protect you?\"\n\"That shouldn’t be necessary. They probably won’t expect me to have escaped, nor anticipate this. You take care of things there first. I need some time alone to think.\"\nThe call ended. Su Ping sat on a bench in the hospital lobby, lost in thought.\nAfter a brief surge of anger, Su Ping completely regained his composure. He sank into deep contemplation.\nSu Ping was 100 percent certain that the ones who made their move were definitely Mu Yu and his associates from earlier that day. Because aside from these people from Eagle Country, no one else would have the audacity, nor would they deploy Mechanical Weapons.\nBut why?\nHe could understand their brazenness, given that there was not a shred of evidence now.\nThe Beast Tamers who had acted were as dead as could be. Even if their Eagle Country identities were suspected, having the Beast Master Association’s guards apprehend them would, at most, result in a couple of days of questioning. Su Ping believed that since they had made a move, they certainly wouldn’t fear these measures. Moreover, due to their status, it was unlikely that overly harsh measures would be used.\nYet, still, why? Was it just because I didn’t give Mu Yu face and summoned the Paperman, so they were driven by shame and anger to kill me?\nIf it were young people around twenty, new to the world, Su Ping would believe they might act that way. But clearly, Mu Yu was not one of them.\nThe only reason seems to be that same goal from before? Mu Yu wanted Qian Yi, the Paperman. But if I died, and in such a manner, how could Mu Yu obtain the Paperman?\nTherefore, Su Ping quickly speculated that their objective wasn’t just the Paperman. Indeed, if it were only for the Paperman, they probably wouldn’t have chosen to decisively kill me.\nAt most, they would capture me. Of course, it’s not out of the question that they have other means to control a Pet Beast after its Beast Tamer’s death. But considering the situation at the time, I still lean towards another possibility. The reason they wanted to kill me must involve a more important cause. What could that be? To eliminate a Genius Breeder from Dragon Nation for Eagle Country?\nSu Ping didn’t really think he was a genius, or important to that extent. His mind raced, recalling the brief, less-than-five-minute first encounter with Mu Yu and his group that morning.\nJust from those five minutes, they decided to use such methods to eliminate me? Then nearly every sentence, every glance, might hold extremely special significance.\nWith that thought, he subconsciously touched his neck. A cold sensation spread from his palm deep into his heart.\nAt this moment, Mu Yu’s last words echoed in Su Ping’s mind.\n\"The pendant is quite nice, isn’t it?\"\nSu Ping was somewhat confused. He then took off the Sword Seal Pendant hanging from his neck. It was a pitch-black, sword-shaped pendant that looked a bit like a cross, but one could clearly see it was indeed sword-shaped.\nApart from the strange Skull Head on this small, sword-shaped pendant, which looked somewhat unconventional, this object was no different from the tacky five-dollar trinkets from his previous life. Of course, that was only its appearance.\nIn fact, as a spatial pendant, it held value. That’s why Su Ping had kept it.\nSome items inconvenient to store in the Beast Taming Space had been temporarily tossed inside. Indeed, it was from within this pendant that he had retrieved Mu Yu’s Cultivation Journal.\nSo, it was this item?\nSu Ping’s eyebrows furrowed.\nAt this moment, it was as if a realization struck him; his heart understood something, yet numerous doubts remained. The Heavenly Tomb Sword Seal, left behind by the Fengdu Sword King, was originally just a spatial item for storing the Sword King’s cultivation journal. But now, it appeared to be far more complex than that.\nHeavenly Tomb Sword Seal?\nSu Ping recalled the name the Fengdu Sword King had given this artifact.\nAnd what about the Fengdu Sword King’s so-called ’slaying the Ghost Gods of the Heavenly Tomb again’?\nSu Ping hadn’t paid much attention to it before. Historically, there were many human forbidden zones, areas controlled by Ferocious Beasts. However, as countless years passed and human Beast Tamers grew stronger alongside the expansion of civilization, the number of such forbidden zones greatly diminished.",

Su Ping’s ’Second Grandpa’!_2\nTherefore, the only known true human-forbidden zones in the world today are places like the Endless Sea.\nThere are undoubtedly others, but Su Ping doesn’t know much about them.\nSo, what is the Heavenly Tomb?\nWithout a second thought, Su Ping first searched on his phone, and as expected, there was no trace.\nHe then accessed the Breeder Association’s internal network and continued to search for the keyword ’Heavenly Tomb.’\nRegrettably, it was still nowhere to be found.\nIn the end, Su Ping pursed his lips. He utilized his Legion authority to enter the Legion’s internal communication channels and searched for ’Heavenly Tomb’ once again.\nThis time, there was finally some information.\nHowever, it was only a very succinct introduction:\n[In the utmost north of Dragon Nation, spreading to the Frozen Nation, lies an endless land of the Undead. Known from ancient times to the present as ’Heavenly Tomb.’ However, □□□, with great ambition and strategy, in the year of □□□, personally led a great army deep into the Heavenly Tomb. From then on, the Undead of the Heavenly Tomb began to disappear...]\nIt was a simple message and didn’t differ much from Su Ping’s speculation.\nBut it was still incomplete.\nWho had such great ambition and strategy, and when did they enter this so-called Heavenly Tomb?\nThese details remained invisible.\nSu Ping frowned. He glanced at the Sword Seal in his hand once more.\nThen, what exactly is the connection between this thing and the Heavenly Tomb?\nFinally, he tried one last search in the Legion’s search list for keywords like ’Heavenly Tomb Sword Seal.’\nThe result, as expected, was completely blank.\nClearly, I don’t know what this Sword Seal is for. But the one thing I do know is that this matter is definitely not something I can get involved in, at least not the current me. Without knowing the full situation, I could very easily get caught in an AOE attack and die! Just like this time.\nWith that thought, Su Ping heaved a deep sigh, a hint of chill flashing through his eyes.\nIt won’t be that easy to kill me!\nAt that moment, his phone suddenly lit up. Dong Muyun’s call was coming through once again.\n\"Hello, Su Ping, the Mechanical Core has sustained some damage, but it hasn’t been completely destroyed, so you don’t need to worry for now. However, the opponent likely used an H66521 self-destruct type mechanical weapon. The impact area is small, but the force within that area is extremely intense. No clues can be found. Even the DNA material of the assailant is impossible to extract. What exactly is going on?\"\n\"I’m okay. Come to the hospital. I need to make a few phone calls first!\"\nDong Muyun understood and promptly hung up.\nSu Ping, meanwhile, had already dialed another number.\n\"Hello, Old Liu, I was attacked. I suspect Mu Yu was behind it. They used a mechanical weapon. Please, don’t get agitated...\"\n\"Hello, Old Qin, I was attacked this morning...\"\nAfter thinking for a moment, Su Ping made another call to the Legion.\n\"Hello, Uncle Lin...\"\nInstantly, because of these few calls, the entirety of Linzhou was thrown into chaos!\n「Beast Law Enforcement Office.」\nAs the largest law enforcement agency in the region, its jurisdiction and power were, predictably, immense.\nAt the same time, as the Director of this Jianghai Law Enforcement Office, Qu Ming was a significant figure not only in Linzhou City but throughout the entire Jianghai region.\nHowever, today was evidently an exceptional day.\nQu Ming, who had already gone home after work, was summoned back to his unit by a phone call and was now sitting at his desk.\nThen, two calls came in quick succession.\n\"Hello, President Qin. Yes, yes, rest assured...\"\n\"Vice President Liu? What? How outrageous! Rest assured...\"\nNot long after, a convoy of teams streamed out from the Law Enforcement Office.\nMeanwhile, in the heart of Linzhou City, within a private room on the 58th floor of ’Mu Xiu Yu Lin,’ one of Linzhou’s most luxurious hotels, several figures were seated. Cups clinked as they enjoyed themselves, the atmosphere lively and convivial.\nQin Chuan looked at Mu Yu before him and chuckled. \"Breeder Mu, it’s been a long time since you returned to Linzhou City. How do you find it? Are the changes in Linzhou beyond your expectations?\"\nMu Yu let out a soft \"Heh.\" \"Indeed, beyond expectations. Not just the city’s changes, but the people’s changes too...\" Mu Yu said meaningfully.\nQin Chuan raised an eyebrow. \"Oh?\"\nChris, at their side, smiled and said, \"Chief Qin, there’s a saying in your Dragon Nation: ’Things are still the same, but the people are different.’ Our teacher’s return this time feels just like that.\"\nQin Chuan seemed to understand something. After a moment’s thought, he said, \"I see. But Breeder Mu, rest assured, no matter what, I am your friend!\"\n\"Hahaha! With your words, Chief Qin, this old man is completely satisfied!\" Mu Yu paused, then added, \"By the way, Chief Qin, that matter I asked you to look into before—have you been able to confirm it? The Secret Realm that appeared in Linzhou, is it located on the outskirts of Linzhou?\"\n\"Well, Breeder Mu, didn’t you ask about that on the phone this afternoon? I asked my father. In the past year, only one Secret Realm has appeared within Linzhou’s borders. There shouldn’t be any mistake!\"\nMu Yu smiled faintly. \"Of course, I trust you, Chief Qin. You’ve experienced the wider world during your time in Eagle Country. Naturally, I also understand your intentions. However, the Heart of Gold is the core of global finance. Each time new ’golden blood’ is introduced, other members incur losses. I’m sure you understand this, Chief Qin. Therefore, this isn’t something I have the authority to decide... But rest assured, I have sensed your enthusiasm and sincerity. When the time comes, I will personally find a way to speak with a few of the directors about it.\"",

Come, let me toast you!\"\nQin Chuan, clearly very excited, picked up his glass. Just then, his phone suddenly rang. Qin Chuan was taken aback. He glanced at his phone in surprise, his brows slightly furrowed. \"Excuse me, gentlemen, I need to step out for a moment.\"\nThe private room quickly fell silent.\nMu Yu glanced at Chris, then at Harman, frowning slightly. He waved his hand, and a Spirit Barrier once again isolated Chris. Only then did Mu Yu speak, \"Harman, there shouldn’t be any problems, right?\"\nHarman nodded. \"I’ve already investigated. That Breeder Su’s background isn’t ordinary, but he’s ultimately just an elite Breeder. And the Secret Realm Qin Chuan mentioned is indeed within Su Ping’s breeding base.\"\nMu Yu smiled. \"I really didn’t expect this—to stumble upon it so effortlessly after fearing a long search! I thought it would take ages to find, but it turned out to be authentic! Has the task Lord Charles assigned us truly been accomplished so easily?\"\nHarman, clearly not as relaxed as Mu Yu, furrowed his brow slightly. \"Lord Mu,\" he said, \"Su Ping has an extraordinary background, and he seems to have some connection to Qin Chuan’s father. If this gets out, it won’t be easy for us to escape, and even Qin Chuan might be displeased...\"\nMu Yu glanced sideways at him. \"Firstly, as long as this is accomplished, nothing else matters. Secondly, Qin Chuan won’t fall out with me. He’s desperate to join Heart of Gold, and I’m the only one who can put in a good word for him. And lastly, as long as it isn’t exposed, everything will be fine!\"\nAs he spoke, a thought crossed Mu Yu’s mind, and a black, spherical object appeared in his hand. The sphere was adorned with colorful patterns, and something seemed to be writhing inside. \"This is a Soul Parasite egg,\" Mu Yu said. \"Eat it. I have Lord Charles’s Soul Power projection on me, so even if they trace it back to me, it won’t be a big deal. But it’s different for you! Once you consume this, the Soul Parasite will devour everything that has happened from your soul. They won’t be able to get anything out of you, even with spirit or soul-type abilities!\"\nHarman glanced at the object in horror. But, meeting Mu Yu’s indifferent gaze, he ultimately swallowed it whole without a second thought. In less than three seconds, Harman’s eyes turned pitch black, devoid of any light. However, they soon returned to normal, and he looked around, dazed.\nMeanwhile, Qin Chuan, who had just stepped out, answered his phone, his voice tinged with displeasure. \"Dad, what’s wrong?\"\n\"Where are you right now?\" Qin Erlong’s voice came through the phone, calmer than Qin Chuan had ever heard it.\nQin Chuan, however, wasn’t concerned. He laughed and said, \"Didn’t I tell you? Mu Yu isn’t staying long, so I just came to have a drink with him.\"\n\"Come back to me. Right now.\"\n\"Dad, what happened?!\"\n\"...\"\nAfter a pause, Qin Erlong’s voice finally came through, slow and deliberate. \"Come back first; we’ll talk when you’re here. Something might happen this time. In short, come back quickly. Also, your mother is right. You should stop contacting people from Eagle Country. The association isn’t good.\"\nThe call ended.\nQin Chuan stood blankly before the private room door.\nWhat on earth is going on?\nHe clearly respected his father a great deal, but he still had to say goodbye before leaving.\nHowever, just as he was about to turn back into the private room, the nearby elevator doors opened. Several figures stepped out, approaching the astonished Qin Chuan.\nHadn’t he booked this entire fifty-eighth floor of the ’Wood Prime’ Hotel? Who are these people?\nSoon, Qin Chuan’s expression changed. The man in the lead was dressed ordinarily, but the figures behind him exuded a stern aura. More terrifying still, several of those following wore Legion uniforms.\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" the man began, \"are Mu Yu, Harman Colin, and Chris Burrell here?\"\nQin Chuan nodded, then reflexively frowned and asked, \"Who are you?\"\nThe lead man’s expression was stern as he produced a badge. \"We’re from the Jianghai Beast Law Enforcement Office. I’m Gu Hao, captain of the enforcement team. We suspect these three men are connected to an attack and explosion case involving Mechanical Weapons, as well as the endangerment of a Legion honorary officer. If you’re not involved, please step aside. If you are connected to these three, please accompany us to the Law Enforcement Bureau to assist with the investigation.\"\nQin Chuan’s expression changed drastically upon hearing this. He suddenly understood why his father had urged him to return quickly. But now, it seemed too late.\nQin Chuan frowned. \"When did this happen?\"\nGu Hao looked at Qin Chuan. He actually knew who this man was, which was why he elaborated, \"Forty-five minutes ago!\"\n\"Impossible! Breeder Mu and the others have been with me all evening!\"\nGu Hao’s brows furrowed slightly. But considering the phone calls that had come in that night, the rumors he’d heard, and all the orders he’d received, he spoke without preamble.",

Besides, Mr. Qin, if you want a clearer understanding, you can also choose to come back to the station with us!\"\nQin Chuan was startled and didn’t quite follow, \"You know who I am?\"\nGu Hao chuckled softly.\nHe then gave a signal to the person behind him, and in an instant, everyone burst into the private room.\nA series of Pet Beast summoning lights lit up...\n...\nIn Linzhou, this was destined to be a sleepless night.\nTime rewound slightly to a little earlier. At the far north of Dragon Nation, some unusual activities were also taking place.\nThis was in an office, but this office was quite special. It had no conventional lighting; instead, intermittent cold blue flames burned.\nA handsome-faced man was smilingly watching the projection screen through his virtual glasses.\nOn the screen, young ladies lifted their legs and twisted their waists, which could be described as quite enticing. Additionally, mixed in were the effects of activating the special Talent \"Beast Transformation\" Skills, turning the originally lively and adorable young women into bunny girls and fox-eared girls.\nWho could resist that?\nThe man watching was clicking his tongue in admiration, \"Not bad, not bad. The little internet celebrities recently introduced by these domestic entertainment companies are really something...\"\nUnfortunately, such comfort lasted less than ten minutes before a crisp voice rang out in the room.\n\"Master, the permissions you set within Dragon Nation’s internal network have been activated. It has been detected that someone in Dragon Nation is repeatedly searching for keywords. The searcher’s information and IP address have been locked!\"\nThe man was startled and gently touched his virtual glasses, \"Hmm? Continue.\"\n\"Master, the search keywords are ’Heavenly Tomb’ and ’Heavenly Tomb Sword Seal.’ Multiple searches were carried out through ordinary search channels, internal Breeder channels, and internal Legion channels.\"\nAs soon as the mechanical voice spoke, the man’s eyes instantly brightened.\nThe Sword Seal has appeared? Good thing I’d taken precautions. I knew those damn fools at Qintian Monitor couldn’t be relied on! Some Secret Realms are completely off their radar. Once the Sword Seal appears, it’s very likely that whoever finds it will detect it and search through various means. Hehe, just as I expected.\nThe man’s northern accent revealed his excitement without a doubt, proud of his foresight and wisdom.\n\"However, they’re searching through a Legion channel? Looks like it’s one of our own. Ba Tian, get me the searcher’s IP address and information!\"\n\"Yes! The searcher’s name is Su Ping. He is male, eighteen years old. His IP address indicates Linzhou City, Jianghai Province. He was awarded a first-class merit and the honorary title of Major by the Jianghai Province Beast Tamer Legion a month ago.\"\n\"Su Ping... eighteen? Honorary Major? First-class merit? Wait, where did you say he is?\"\n\"Master, he’s in Jianghai Forest Province!\"\nSuddenly startled, the man scratched his head and asked, \"What about his family?\"\n\"His father, Su Anyong, twenty years ago...\"\nBefore the electronic voice could finish, the man looked as if he’d seen a ghost, \"What the f*ck? Su Zhongguang’s grandson? Isn’t this too much of a damn coincidence?\"\nCould Su Anyong have gotten it? Did he take advantage of his return to Linzhou to give it to his son early, setting this trap to mess with me? Was it to get revenge for the resentment he’s held all these years, after I drove him out back then? But when Su Zhongguang died, he entrusted me with letting this brat live a normal life. As the lad’s nominal uncle, I’m damn well justified here. Besides, even though the Su kid looks unreliable, he wouldn’t mess with me over something as huge as the Heavenly Tomb, would he? Otherwise, I wouldn’t have planned to give him the instructor position for the Undead Special Forces tasked with exploring the Heavenly Tomb in the future.\nThinking of this, the man curiously looked at the information about Su Ping projected on the screen.\nThe man sucked his teeth, \"How did he come by this first-class merit and this honorary military rank?\"\n\"Master, during a special competition conducted by the Jianghai Province Beast Tamer Legion’s Forest Wild Army, Su Ping, as the Breeder for the first-place winner, was personally given the honor by Zhao Deguang.\"\nThe mechanical voice responded immediately.\nThe man blinked.\nSo this rascal isn’t yanking my chain? Their family’s kid, he really has talent?\nThe man propped up his chin, suddenly intrigued, \"Where’s this little guy now? Can he make some time to come to Beiyuan Province soon? Heh, I’m quite interested in this little fella.\"\nThe mechanical electronic voice paused briefly, then finally responded, \"Reporting to Master, he is in the hospital.\"\n\"Hm? The kid is sick? Does Su Anyong know about this?\" The man’s brows furrowed slightly.\n\"After accessing Qintian Monitor privileges to observe, an investigation into the mechanical cameras at Linzhou City’s Brilliant Unicorn Hospital showed that Su Ping instantly appeared in the hospital’s hall via spatial teleportation. The specific reason is unknown. At the same time, while in the Brilliant Unicorn Hospital, he searched for keywords related to the Heavenly Tomb and the Heavenly Tomb Sword Seal.\"\n\"What?\"\nHearing his Mechanical Pet Beast’s reply, the man’s brows furrowed even deeper. His years of perception made him sense that things might not be as simple as they appeared. \"Use my privileges,\" he ordered, \"to see what’s really going on! Why did he use spatial teleportation to get to the hospital?\"\nThis is Dragon Nation! The official forces are spread throughout the entire Dragon Nation. Unless it’s in some remote deep mountains and old forests, if it involves the mechanical network, he can learn about it immediately with his privileges.\n\"Yes, please wait a moment, Master.\"\nThis time, it was clear that the man was no longer in the mood to continue watching the internet celebrity beast girls dance or the spirited lads nodding their heads. His brows slightly furrowed, his knuckles tapped lightly on the desk, making a dull sound, as if each tap struck a chord in his heart.\nFinally, after more than half an hour had passed, the virtual glasses in front of him responded.\n\"Reporting to Master, some situations have been detected!\"\n\"Speak!\"\nThe mechanical voice did not speak; instead, a special video appeared in front of the man.\n\"After detection, this video was posted on a local Linzhou forum ten minutes ago. The video quality is very blurry, but it appears to show a Beast Tamer battle underway. It was just deleted by the forum administrator.\"\nThe man clicked on the video, and his brows never relaxed.\nWhat kind of damn quality is this? How could anyone make anything out?\nHowever, what could be clearly seen didn’t matter. The final earth-shattering explosion and blaze of light, despite obviously being filmed from a great distance, still caused the recorder’s phone to shake and the screen to go black.\n\"Mechanical Weapons?\"\n\"Correct, Master. Eventually, one side detonated Mechanical Weapons. Also, after comparison, the video’s location is on the outskirts of Linzhou, on the way to Lingxi River. Su Ping’s home is at the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base at Lingxi River Station, which is along this route. Based on data inference, the probability that Su Ping is one of the individuals in the video is 95.87%...\"\nBOOM!\nA horrifying Spirit shock, like a tidal wave, instantly plunged the already dimly lit office into complete Darkness. However, in the Darkness, a pair of blood-red eyes suddenly lit up, filled entirely with ferocity and Bloodthirst.\nBut it was only for a moment; everything returned to normal just as quickly. The cold blue flames relit, and the blood-red eyes disappeared. The man’s expression became incredibly calm once again.\nBut he didn’t even dare to contemplate it.\nWhat if Su Ping died in Linzhou? What would happen? Never mind how I would face Su Zhongguang beneath the nine springs. Su Anyong is right there in the camp in the far north. Su Anyong came to Beiyuan for his son. If something happened to Su Ping... If this kid hadn’t inexplicably searched for the Heavenly Tomb, triggering the keyword I set in my permissions and alerting me, I’d probably still be in the dark about this! Are all the official forces in Jianghai just loafing around?!\nHe subconsciously took out his phone. However, after thinking it over, he put the phone down beside him and said directly, \"Ba Tian, ask Xiao Xing to go to some trouble. Mobilize the Sky-splitter, and accompany me on an overnight flight to Linzhou.\"\nAfter all, he, this so-called ’Second Grandpa,’ had never even had a good look at the little guy.",

      "content": "Chapter 267: Chapter 161: Arrest and Interrogation? Never Give Up Until Death!\nSu Ping looked at the small, fist-sized sphere in his hand.\nHe observed it curiously.\nIs this the Mechanical Core?\nThe source of the new era’s luxury Mechanical Pet Beasts?\nIt truly is miraculous.\n\"Stop looking. The previous explosion... even though this little thing activated its protective abilities and had Black Blood as a buffer, it was still affected by the shockwave. It’ll likely take some time and specific methods to recover.\"\nDong Muyun watched the young master helplessly.\nAnyone else facing such a major incident would have been dumbfounded. Even after surviving such a terrifying attack, it would be normal for them to live in constant fear.\nBut not this guy; he doesn’t seem to care at all.\nFortunately, this little fellow was quite sensible and agreed to stay at the Bright Unicorn Hospital for observation for two days.\n\"This little guy saved my life. No matter what, you have to help me restore it as much as possible.\"\nSu Ping gently set Feifei’s Mechanical Core down.\n\"How could this happen?\"\nDong Muyun, even now, couldn’t help but sigh with emotion.\n\"Didn’t I just tell you? Tsk, tsk. Those people from the Eagle Country are completely insane.\"\nDong Muyun found it hard to believe. \"Could it have been someone else? Could it possibly have been Dong Mutian?\"\nSu Ping shot her a sideways glance.\nDoes she really want her older brother dead that badly?\nUnfortunately, however, they both knew it couldn’t have been Dong Mutian.\nIf Dong Mutian were capable of pulling off something that seemed reckless but was actually flawless, he wouldn’t have made such a fool of himself back then.\nDong Muyun smiled and finally let out a sigh of relief. \"You have no idea, when I first got your call, I was nearly scared to death. Don’t worry, now that I’m here, there won’t be any more danger.\"\nSu Ping glanced at her again.\nHe wisely chose not to respond at this moment.\nInstead, he sighed.\n\"What’s wrong?\"\nDong Muyun looked at him.\n\"Black Blood... damn it! I only had it for a few days!\nAm I naturally a vehicle-killer?\n\"\nSu Ping’s face was etched with grief and indignation. To think he’d wrecked such a high-end sports car after just a few days, losing his chance to show off to Su Anyong again.\n\"You still have the mind for such thoughts? You’re really courting death! By the way, who else have you told? Why haven’t Vice President Liu and President Qin arrived yet? Besides them, did you inform anyone else?\"\nIndeed, more than an hour had passed since Su Ping called Dong Muyun, yet the leaders from the two major Associations still hadn’t arrived.\nLin Lei, however, had called three minutes earlier to inform him that this elder from the Legion, Chief Lin himself, was personally leading the ’Moon Wolf Squad,’ the ace elite company of the Battle Wolf A Division. They had already entered Linzhou’s territory.\nSu Ping shook his head. \"As long as they know I’m alright, that’s enough. They probably have more important matters to attend to right now.\"\nHis relationship with President Qin and Vice President Liu didn’t require such formalities. Once they learned about the current situation from the phone call and knew Dong Muyun and the Legion members had arrived to protect him, they understood the priority was to investigate the source of the attack!\nAs for anyone else, he naturally wouldn’t tell them. His father was too far away; telling him would only cause unnecessary worry. The others from the Heart of Woods couldn’t offer much help either.\nNot long after, Lin Lei arrived. Chief Lin seemed more anxious than anyone.\nThis wasn’t just because Su Ping was the son of that mysterious special forces squad leader. He was also their Legion’s honorary officer and, most importantly, a vital pillar of support for their Battle Wolf A Division!\nIn recent days, thanks to the effects of the Heart of the Wolf, the overall strength of their Battle Wolf A Division had improved qualitatively.\nNow, hearing Su Ping was in trouble, even Zhao Deguang had issued a direct order for Lin Lei to rush over and ensure his personal safety.\n\"Are you alright, Su Ping? What on earth happened?\"\n\"I’m fine! See? Fit as a fiddle!\" Su Ping patted his chest, which finally allowed Lin Lei to breathe a sigh of relief.\nLin Lei then heard the general sequence of events from Su Ping. Of course, Su Ping didn’t mention the Heavenly Tomb, as he was somewhat uncertain about it and chose not to discuss it with others.\nAnd just as Su Ping had expected...\n「In the interrogation room of the Linzhou Law Enforcement Office.」\nSeveral figures stood there, their expressions icy. Qin Erlong and Liu Fuhai, whom Su Ping had mentioned, were undoubtedly among them. Qu Ming was there as well.\nIn front of them were four monitors, each displaying several individuals. Clearly, they were all undergoing separate interrogations.\nWhat made Qin Erlong’s expression even more grim was that Qin Chuan was also among those being interrogated. And clearly, he played a significant role.\nJust don’t let there be any real involvement!\nQin Erlong sighed, his gaze shifting to the monitor that clearly showed the most likely breakthrough point among the interrogated individuals.\nGu Hao, captain of the law enforcement team, stared coldly at the Caucasian man before him. His eyes seemed to exert an overwhelming, tide-like pressure.\n\"Harman Colin! Evidence indicates you directed others to use Mechanical Weapons with the intent to attack an Intermediate Level Breeder from our Dragon Nation. What do you have to say for yourself?\"\n\"FUCK! You Dragon Nation people! You dragged me here for no reason and are spouting this nonsense? Who did I attack? Since when does the Dragon Nation operate without evidence?\" Harman shouted indignantly, his anger appearing genuine.\n\"Silence!\"\nGu Hao’s brow furrowed. An almost indescribable pressure emanated from him, plunging the interrogation room into deep silence. This was the effect of the Mental Category special Pet Beast, the \"Judgment Mirror.\"\n\"Su Ping. You wouldn’t claim not to know him, would you? Just an hour and a half ago, Breeder Su Ping was attacked!\"\n\"Su Ping? I’ve only met him once! Why would I want to kill him?\"\n\"Because Su Ping rejected Mu Yu’s request to see his Pet Beasts, you harbored resentment. Mu Yu then instructed you to kill Su Ping, using someone else to do the deed!\"\nInstantly, an overwhelming, landslide-like pressure bore down from the concealed Judgment Mirror. Even Harman couldn’t help but tremble before this special, Monarch Level, Mental Category Pet Beast that was also an artifact.\nIt was as if his very soul and spirit quivered before the Judgment Mirror. In its presence, he seemed to possess neither the ability nor the courage to lie!\nHowever, despite trembling uncontrollably before the Judgment Mirror, Harman still shook his head vehemently, his eyes glaring as he retorted, \"FUCK! I didn’t do it! Are you Dragon Nation people trying to beat a confession out of me? Once I get out, I’ll hire the best lawyer! You’ll see how tough I am! You’ll learn that people from the Eagle Country are not to be trifled with!\"\nGu Hao’s brow furrowed deeper.\nWhat’s going on?\nWith Harman’s strength, even under the Judgment Mirror’s influence, if his willpower was truly that incredible, some sign should have emerged, right?\nFor a moment, Gu Hao genuinely couldn’t be sure.\nAfter all, this wasn’t a Dragon Nation citizen; with their own people, they could employ more direct methods. For example, a Soul Search.\nBut considering the man’s identity—someone from the Eagle Country—mishandling this could lead to significant trouble.\nSo, Gu Hao thought for a moment, then said to the person beside him, \"Keep a close watch on him!\"\nWith that, he left the interrogation room.\n\"Director, does this guy really seem clean?\" Gu Hao asked somewhat cautiously, glancing at the two elders seated there.\nQu Ming, standing to the side, felt helpless. Whether there were issues or not was ultimately up to those two old gentlemen.\nQin Erlong and Liu Fuhai also had tightly furrowed brows as they turned their attention to the monitors showing Chris’s and Mu Yu’s interrogation rooms.\nClearly, nothing incriminating had been discerned from young Chris. Under the pressure of the mental interrogation, he had spilled nearly everything he knew, but none of it was relevant to this case.\nThey also knew that even if these individuals were responsible, they wouldn’t have confided in a junior like Chris.\nMu Yu’s interrogation, however, was clearly not progressing smoothly either.\nCompared to Harman, who was terrified under the Judgment Mirror’s pressure, Mu Yu merely smiled faintly, responding to the interrogator with a chuckle, \"I am a registered Senior Breeder from the Eagle Country and a student of the Undead Breeding Master Charles Lee. I hold a respected position in countries across the globe. You have no evidence whatsoever. Do you understand the implications of groundlessly accusing a Senior Breeder?\"\n\"Heh, I’ve already contacted the embassy in Magic Capital. I won’t waste another breath on you until the Eagle Country ambassador arrives with a lawyer. Furthermore, according to Blue Star’s universal legal regulations, if you still have no evidence within forty-eight hours, you must release me. After all, heh, I haven’t finished catching up with my old friends yet!\"\nAs he said this, Mu Yu even winked at the camera above, a smile playing on his lips.\nClearly, he knew that Liu Fuhai was very likely watching this unfold at that very moment!\nHis behavior was, without a doubt, a blatant provocation.\nLiu Fuhai’s face turned ashen with rage.\nIf Su Ping hadn’t been alright, he might have done something truly unthinkable.\nBut even so, Liu Fuhai still strode into the interrogation room, ignoring everyone’s surprised gazes, and stared intently at Mu Yu.\n\"Mu Yu, what are you so smug about? Even though Su Ping is unharmed, I will never let you off the hook! Daring to use Mechanical Weapons within Linzhou City! You’ve really outdone yourself. Initially, I genuinely believed you joined the Eagle Country reluctantly because of differing breeding philosophies. Now it seems I was wrong! From this day forward, all ties between us are severed. From now on, you and I are irreconcilable enemies!\"\nMu Yu was momentarily startled, looking at this old friend he hadn’t seen in many years. He truly hadn’t expected his return to the Dragon Nation to culminate in this.\nOf course, what truly made Mu Yu frown slightly was something Liu Fuhai had just said!\nSu Ping is unharmed?\nMu Yu’s expression suddenly darkened, then he scoffed disdainfully, \"Then bring it on! I’m waiting to see how you, Liu Fuhai, plan to be my irreconcilable enemy!\"\nThe interrogation room door closed.\nQin Erlong looked at Old Liu, whose face was frighteningly dark. He then sighed helplessly and lifted his gaze toward his own son, Qin Chuan, who was still in another interrogation room explaining the alibis of the three individuals.\nQin Erlong sighed again.\nThis incident will likely leave Su Ping and Old Liu with some lingering resentment,\nhe thought.\nHowever, what Qin Erlong and Liu Fuhai clearly didn’t know was that...\n「High above the skies of Linzhou, at this very moment.」\nA strangely shaped aircraft had appeared in the night sky. High in the Sky Dome, the aircraft’s hatch swung open.\nA figure braced against the howling celestial winds and leaped from an altitude of ten thousand meters.\nAn illusory throne materialized, allowing the figure to land smoothly on a rooftop.\nThe man seemed to radiate a faint, azure glow, as if enveloped in ethereal blue flames.\nHis extremely handsome face scanned the surroundings briefly. After confirming the direction, he glanced at the cold-faced man who was stowing away the vessel named ’Sky-splitter’, then smiled faintly. \"Come on, let’s go see how my ’bargain’ grandson is doing.\"",

Not to mention in Linzhou, he could even walk sideways in Jianghai.\nBut when it came to certain matters, such connections were useless.\nHe needed to work even harder!\nSu Ping sighed.\nAs one’s abilities and status rose, the dangers one might face would also increase.\nOnly by enhancing one’s own strength could one stand tall and unyielding at any time.\nHowever, just as Su Ping was resolutely making up his mind, a ghostly blue light suddenly lit up on the ceiling. Like a sudden appearance of will-o’-the-wisps, it made Su Ping slightly stunned, followed by a wave of coldness throughout his body.\nMany times, such eerie things represented a type of Pet Beast: the Necromancy Series!\nAnd Su Ping’s recent encounter with the Necromancy Series could probably be none other than Mu Yu, right?\nBut wasn’t Mu Yu already captured?\nDid that old thing have a backup plan?\nBut under these circumstances, could that old thing have bypassed Dong Muyun and Lin Lei’s guard and come in directly?\nWithout even thinking, Su Ping picked up an object at hand and threw it out.\n\"Guards!\"\nWithin the cold ghostly blue flames, a voice with a hint of a smile sounded.\n\"Kid, you’re quite vigilant, but don’t worry.\"\nThe voice was extremely mellow, completely different from Mu Yu’s voice from before. Su Ping was slightly startled. The next moment, this cold ghostly flame slowly transformed into a figure. Blue flames surrounded him, like wandering souls from the legends. Yet, they also illuminated the figure.\nHe looked like a very young man. Even from Su Ping’s perspective, the man before him seemed to be in his twenties at most. However, those eyes that seemed to also burn with blue flames held an age-deep sagacity that didn’t match his apparent youth.\nThe man, looking at Su Ping who was stunned on the bed, finally shifted from ethereal to physical, studying Su Ping with satisfaction.\n\"Not bad, not bad! The little fellow looks pretty good, kinda reminds me of myself when I was young!\"\nSu Ping cast a doubtful glance at this strangely appearing man.\nWho exactly was he? ’When I was young’? Isn’t he young right now?\n\"Who are you, sir? Charles?\"\n\"Sir? Charles?\"\nThe man was momentarily taken aback, clearly unaccustomed to such address. He then cracked a smile.\n\"Heh, I’m not that neither-alive-nor-dead guy; just call me Leng Ye. Relax, don’t look like that. If I wanted to do anything to you, kid, you’d have been dead long ago.\"\nThe man flicked a blue flame, completely lighting up the room.\nSu Ping took a deep breath.\nYes, the first person Su Ping thought of regarding this sudden visitor was none other than Charles Lee, the mysterious and powerful idol, an Undead Cultivator, mentioned in Mu Yu’s diary.\nHe guessed that Mu Yu’s backer might very well be this idol of his.\nAnd since the other party was so eager to kill him, it could very well be related to Eagle Country. So, this mysterious and powerful Charles might not be averse to taking matters into his own hands!\nBut if not him, then who could possess such power to breach Lin Lei and Dong Muyun’s defenses and arrive here so stealthily?\nHowever, it was clear that the man before him seemed to have no intention of answering that question. Instead, he frowned slightly.\n\"Kid, is Charles involved in this attack you experienced? What exactly happened?\"\nSu Ping nodded.\n\"It’s just my guess, but Mu Yu and those people from Eagle Country were likely the ones who attacked me.\"\n\"Tell me everything from the beginning!\"\nThe man glanced at Su Ping.\nBut Su Ping was unfazed, without even a ripple of emotion.\nBecause he knew, from the lack of even the slightest response from outside to his actions and shouts, that in the face of this person, he truly was like a fish on the chopping block.\nAnd clearly, this seemed to be a very formidable figure.\nSu Ping didn’t harbor any adolescent resentment about his own weakness.\nHow old was he? How old were these old monsters involved this time? Thinking such useless thoughts was purely looking for trouble.",

He repeated what he had previously told Dong Muyun and Lin Lei. However, not knowing who the other party was, Su Ping, although desperate to rid himself of the trouble, ultimately still didn’t mention the Heavenly Tomb Sword Seal.\nHowever, what Su Ping hadn’t expected was this.\nAfter listening to the entire story, the Leng Ye before him actually smiled and took the initiative to ask, \"Kid, I know you’re hiding something. But in this world, apart from your dad, the person you can trust the most isn’t someone else—it’s me!\"\nSu Ping was stunned, still processing this, when the man in front of him continued, \"So, don’t hide the matters about the Heavenly Tomb and the Sword Seal either.\"\n\"...\"\nSu Ping looked at the man before him, momentarily at a loss. \"Who the hell are you?\"\n「Meanwhile, back in the Law Enforcement Office in Linzhou.」\nThe interrogation process had clearly ground to a halt. There was no evidence, no established time of the crime, and even using spiritual pressure Pet Beasts like the Judgment Mirror had no effect. Coupled with Qin Chuan’s alibi, from any angle, there seemed to be no room left for further questioning. Of course, the most crucial factor was the identity of the person involved. They hesitated to take action, fearing repercussions. After all, if this was mishandled, it could indeed lead to international disputes, and who could bear that responsibility? No one dared claim they could. So indeed, the entire situation was at a stalemate.\nQin Erlong finally couldn’t hold back anymore and sighed, \"Old Liu, should I let Qin Chuan out? Don’t worry, I’ll give you and Su Ping an explanation for this afterward.\"\nLiu Fuhai glanced at Qin Erlong, opened his mouth, and finally said, \"Fine. Qin Chuan probably really doesn’t know about this matter.\"\nQin Erlong relaxed slightly, but a sense of helplessness lingered in his heart; he could also discern the unspoken meaning behind his old friend’s words. If Qin Chuan knew about the situation and was deliberately feigning ignorance, or worse, was involved, Liu Fuhai would not let the matter rest.\nIndeed, that was the case. Liu Fuhai’s gaze was calm.\nSo what if Qin Erlong is stronger than me? So what if he has a powerful wife backing him? The internal factions within the upper echelons of the Dragon Nation are incredibly intricate! There are people stronger than the Qin Family. In this matter, no matter who I take this to, I and that young fellow are in the right! At worst, I’ll just have to throw my old face away and not care. Daring to use Mechanical Weapons within the Dragon Nation—even if it was in the suburbs and there were no additional casualties—if I genuinely wanted to expose this, forget Qin Erlong, even that figure in the Magic Capital would definitely be affected! The academic faction is currently in a precarious position; with this kind of incident surfacing now, many people would be eager to step out and make a few sarcastic remarks. At that point, even if that figure wanted to protect them, it wouldn’t be so easy.\nJust then, Qu Ming, the director of the Law Enforcement Office, frowned slightly as he answered his phone. Before he could hear the full message from the other end, the door to the interrogation monitoring room was pushed open directly from the outside.\nAll those present nearly furrowed their brows and turned towards the newcomer. They had given orders that no one was to approach at this time.\nWhat was Director Qu Ming doing?\nQu Ming himself was somewhat stunned because, at that very moment, the call was from the front desk of the Law Enforcement Office, reporting that someone had directly barged in.\nSomeone dares to barge directly into the Law Enforcement Office? What on earth is happening in Linzhou? So many unimaginable things in just one night? And most importantly, this is happening right in front of two chairmen.\n\"Who are you? How dare you barge into the Law Enforcement Office so recklessly?\"\nThe newcomer had an icy, indifferent, almost wooden expression. He appeared to be in his late thirties or early forties and showed no hint of emotional fluctuation. He calmly scanned everyone present, including Qin Chuan, who had just walked out of the interrogation room with a displeased look. Only then did he take out a small booklet from his breast pocket and ask, \"Is this place related to the assault case involving Honorary Major Su Ping?\"\nUpon hearing this, everyone was startled.\nPeople from the Legion have arrived? But even if they are from the Legion, they wouldn’t dare be this arrogant, would they?\nZhao Deguang had just called them, so they knew the entire Moon Wolf Company of Battle Wolf A Division had entered Linzhou. However, they hadn’t heard anything about the Legion wanting to take over the case. Nevertheless, facing the unfamiliar man, they all nodded. Although the Legion had little to do with local affairs, Su Ping’s Legion identity was indeed unquestionable.",

      "content": "Chapter 270: Chapter 162: The Second Generation is Actually Myself?_3\nPeople from the Legion came to ask questions, which was understandable, although their manner of entry wasn’t very polite.\nAfter the man received an affirmative answer, he nodded, placed the small notebook before them, and said coolly, \"By the Commander’s orders, before he arrives personally, all individuals involved, suspects included, are forbidden to leave! Violators will be summarily executed!\"\nSummarily executed!?\nThe pronouncement of those words stunned everyone. The incident indeed had severe repercussions, but who would dare utter such a threat in front of these people at this moment? What was this man thinking?\nHowever, at that very moment, the insignia on the small notebook, along with the special identity displayed, made everyone freeze.\n[Sky-splitter Flight Captain—Xing Chen]\nIndeed, it was just an identity that, on the surface, seemed to be merely that of a pilot. However, aside from Qin Chuan, who knew little about such matters, the other three clearly understood much more.\nGenerally, passenger aircraft don’t have individual names; at most, they are designated by their model codes.\nTherefore, while the captains of such aircraft are certainly skilled, they are entirely different from individuals like the one before them.\nFirstly, the capabilities and functions of these specialized aircraft are different. Ordinary passenger aircraft, especially those within Dragon Nation, though armed, are mainly equipped to defend against airborne Pet Beasts. However, aircraft with individual designations possess a variety of capabilities. It might even be a purely independent Mechanical Pet Beast. More importantly, aircraft with individual names are not used for passenger transport. They exist exclusively to serve a specific, prominent individual. In other words, the arrival of such personnel inherently signifies the authority of the individual they serve.\nQin Erlong was all too familiar with this because he had once personally witnessed his wife accompanied by her pilot, whose aircraft was named ’Cloud Soarer’.\nHowever, upon realizing this, those present were even more taken aback. Even Liu Fuhai exchanged a look of astonishment with Qin Erlong.\nClearly, Liu Fuhai’s unspoken question was obvious:\nHas your wife come personally?\nAnd even more obviously, Qin Erlong also knew that his wife’s exclusive aircraft was named Cloud Soarer, not the Sky-splitter currently before them.\nSo, who was this person who had arrived? Besides his wife, who else was entangled in this affair? Could it be related to Su Ping?!\nFor the first time, Qin Erlong felt utterly bewildered, but the current situation evidently compelled him to accept it.\nQin Chuan was equally bewildered.\nWhat exactly is going on?\nHe was probably the only one completely in the dark. Even moments ago, he hadn’t understood Mu Yu’s situation; he only knew Mu Yu was implicated in a bombing case. Naturally, he wanted to help clear Mu Yu’s name, which would, in turn, help his own bid to join the Heart of Gold.\nNow, however, Qin Chuan seemed to grasp a little more. He was beginning to understand why such an incident would alarm both his father and Vice President Liu.\nSu Ping? Was Su Ping the one involved in this bombing case?\nHis gaze flickered towards his father. At this moment, Qin Chuan thought he understood his father’s urgency.\nHowever, it was clear no one was paying any mind to his thoughts. After a moment’s consideration, Qin Erlong couldn’t resist asking Xing Chen, \"Comrade, do you know who has come to Linzhou?\"\nXing Chen glanced at him.\nQin Erlong stated earnestly, \"I am the president of the Jianghai Beastmaster Association and also Su Ping’s elder. The Jianghai Beastmaster Association is also inextricably involved in this matter.\"\nXing Chen remained noncommittal, then replied coolly, \"They’ve come from Beiyuan Province.\"\nBeiyuan?\nQin Erlong’s pupils contracted slightly.\nBeiyuan Province is Dragon Nation’s most remote northeastern province. North of Beiyuan lies a land of extreme cold, a true no-man’s-land. However, just because the environment is harsh for humans doesn’t mean other living beings don’t thrive there. Undead Types, Elemental Types, and various special Pet Beasts are numerous.\nFor this reason, Beiyuan Province holds a relatively special status. Therefore, much like Ximo Province, exceptional individuals are stationed there year-round. These two regions also experience the most frequent Beast Tides, which still occur occasionally even in this modern era. Conversely, such dangers are rarer in the provinces along the Eastern Sea coast.\nSo... could it be that person from Beiyuan who has arrived?\nQin Erlong’s face twitched.\nIf it were someone else, even one of the prominent figures from the Imperial Capital, he might have been able to smooth things over by leveraging his wife’s influence. But now, quite apart from not knowing the newcomer’s intentions, there was the sheer notoriety of the individual from Beiyuan to consider...\nYes, notoriety! Throughout all of Dragon Nation, apart from the legendary figure at the very apex, only the one from Ximo was cut from the same cloth. He paid no heed to anyone else.\nAccording to his wife, during a previous meeting in the Imperial Capital, the two phrases that individual uttered most frequently were, ’None of your damn business!’ and ’What’s it got to do with me?!’ Moreover, this person wielded immense power and had, from very early on, possessed the authority of ’summary execution before reporting’.\nWhat connection did that individual have with Su Ping, and how were they involved in this case?",

      "content": "Chapter 271: Chapter 162: The Second Generation is Actually Myself?_4\nQin Erlong didn’t know. He only knew that from now on, this matter had nothing to do with him anymore.\nWho would dare to act rashly after that name was invoked?\nAfter all, with the current legend’s rise to power, everyone knew that this ’Ghost Saint’ was the sharpest knife in his hand!\n「...」\n\"Second Grandfather?\"\nSu Ping scratched his head, looking at the man before him who, by appearance, seemed not much older than himself.\nSo, there really *is* such a person, huh?\nHis old man wasn’t just making things up?\nSu Ping pursed his lips.\nAt this moment, he suddenly realized he might have underestimated Su Anyong again.\nDamn, had his own words become a prophecy?\nThis guy was actually the ’Haotian War Master’?\nSu Ping had no reason to doubt. After all, the man’s demeanor gave him no reason to believe he was being deceived.\nSeeing Su Ping’s expression, Leng Ye smiled and nodded.\n\"I’ve always wanted to find some time to check up on you, little rascal. I didn’t expect I’d almost miss the chance. TSK TSK. But you’re a tough one, kid, surviving an attack like that! You were lucky, of course, but it was even better luck for me.\"\nThe man looked at Su Ping, then said, \"You must have guessed by now that Mu Yu’s frenzied attack on you was indeed for that Heavenly Tomb Sword Seal! Come on, let me see it!\"\nSu Ping, knowing what was good for him, decisively took the item off his neck and handed it to the man.\nLeng Ye took it, TSKing in admiration.\nThen he glanced at Su Ping. \"Want to know what this thing is? You even searched for it so many times online before.\"\nTo Leng Ye’s surprise, Su Ping decisively shook his head. \"No...\"\n\"ER...\"\nLeng Ye opened his mouth, then after a moment’s thought, nodded. \"TSK, kid, not knowing is indeed a good thing. Unfortunately, now that you’re involved, you don’t have the luxury of not knowing.\"\nSu Ping felt aggrieved.\nIt really has to be this way?\nAlthough he didn’t know what kind of person this Second Grandfather was, to be able to reveal such profound secrets with a single phrase, and even precisely intercept his online search keywords—what terrifying authority did he possess?\nIf he’d known this blasted thing would cause so much trouble, he never would have taken it from Dong Muyun.\nThat damn Fengdu Sword King Yu Liangqing! Didn’t I just turn his will into this little trinket for Qian Yi? Did he really have to go to such lengths over it?!\n\"Heavenly Tomb. You should know what that is by now. It’s existed since ancient times. However, in reality, more than one Heavenly Tomb has actually been discovered!\"\n\"Oh?!\" Su Ping became genuinely interested.\n\"The Heavenly Tombs are actually in four locations. The one north of us is just one of them; the other three are scattered across the world! Near the location of a Heavenly Tomb, the rate and probability of Undead Pet Beasts appearing are hundreds or thousands of times greater than in other places! Throughout history, the plague of Undead in the north has always existed. It was only with the development of Pet Beasts and large-scale mechanical weapons in modern times, along with the efforts of a Legendary Lord, that this threat was barely eradicated! That was when Dragon Nation discovered the main body of the Heavenly Tomb. It was a giant tomb. At the same time, they also learned that three other identical sites existed around the world, though the symbols on each tombstone differed. The one on the continent of Mummy Nation features a white bone. The one on the continent of Eagle Country displays a flame. And the Heavenly Tomb near Lion Nation, the self-proclaimed Sun Never Sets Empire, is marked with a crown.\"\nLeng Ye continued, beaming, \"And now, you should also know what pattern is on the tombstone of the Heavenly Tomb north of Dragon Nation, right?\"\n\"A sword?\"\nSu Ping felt a sense of dread as he looked at the so-called Heavenly Tomb Sword Seal.\nAt this moment, he finally understood why Mu Yu had launched such a frenzied attack upon seeing it!\nHowever, this time, Su Ping even felt somewhat fortunate. He was glad Mu Yu had been so eager for quick success, rather than planning things out slowly!\nWhat kind of idiotic thing had he done? It was tantamount to a child flaunting gold in a bustling marketplace, or like deliberately courting disaster.\nIn truth, Su Ping was unaware that initially, Mu Yu himself hadn’t truly believed it could be the real Sword Seal and had only made his move with considerable skepticism. It wasn’t until he heard from Qin Chuan that Su Ping had recently come into contact with a Secret Realm that he gained some confidence that this was indeed the Heavenly Tomb Sword Seal itself.\nHis face twitched slightly as he looked at Leng Ye. \"Leng Ye, what exactly is inside the Heavenly Tomb?\"\nLeng Ye smiled. \"I don’t know either. Currently, only the people from Eagle Country have found the key and successfully opened their Heavenly Tomb in the Great Rift Valley. But judging from their eagerness to search for the keys to the other Heavenly Tombs, the contents must be beyond imagination! And Dragon Nation is also making preparations to enter the Heavenly Tomb in the future, such as establishing Special Beast Taming Forces. Of course, that has nothing to do with you.\"\n\"Huh?\" Su Ping was slightly startled.\nPreparations to enter the Heavenly Tomb? Special Beast Taming Forces?\nBefore Su Ping could react, Leng Ye continued, \"So now, kid, what do you plan to do?\"\nWhat to do?\nSu Ping immediately understood Leng Ye was asking about the disposition of this clearly significant Heavenly Tomb Sword Seal.\nSu Ping, being very perceptive, said directly, \"I will hand the Sword Seal over to the nation!\"\nAt that moment, Su Ping felt as if a holy light shone upon him.\nLeng Ye, looking pleased with Su Ping’s teachable attitude, patted his shoulder. \"Good kid, I didn’t misjudge you! HEH. But you don’t need to act so high and mighty; the higher-ups won’t treat you poorly! Besides, let me tell you straight—you couldn’t keep this thing even if you wanted to.\"\nOf course, Su Ping knew he couldn’t keep it. Even if he could, he... would still hand it over this readily!\nNonsense! What was more important, this damn Heavenly Tomb or his own precious life?\nThis attack had already been beyond his expectations. If it happened again, who knew what horrors awaited?\nAs for what was actually inside that Heavenly Tomb? Su Ping wasn’t particularly interested to begin with, and even if he were, it wasn’t worth risking his life for, was it?\nHe should focus on improving himself. Once his status, position, and strength increased, he would naturally learn everything.\nThis ambush had made Su Ping understand one thing: he only had one life. With the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas in his possession, what couldn’t he obtain in the future?\nGoing out and fighting life-and-death battles with others was clearly not his path!\nAfter toying with the Heavenly Tomb Sword Seal for a bit, Leng Ye smiled, and then it vanished from his hand.\nHe looked at the eagerly watching Su Ping and said, \"Don’t worry, you can make any request when the time comes. As for now, you’re not in a hurry, are you? If not, why not join me in handling some real business!?\"\n\"What business?\" Su Ping couldn’t think of anything more important than bargaining for his reward.\nAt this moment, Leng Ye’s face broke into a dazzling smile. \"Don’t you want to see the mastermind?\"\nSu Ping’s eyes lit up. The reason he had been holed up in this hospital was the fear that those people still had some tricks up their sleeves. But now, with this man’s arrival being a true Mechanical Descent, what was there left to fear?\nHowever, he frowned slightly, lamenting, \"Second Grandfather, if they dared to make a move, they must have anticipated various situations and probably left no evidence, right? Even if we go, what can we do to them? After all, they are from Eagle Country...\"\nLeng Ye glanced at this cunning brat, who seemed to be scheming from head to toe, and huffed softly. \"Still trying to sound me out, you little rascal? Relax! Do you know what it is about me that those old coots find most exasperating, yet can do nothing about?\"\nSu Ping blinked and shook his head.\n\"The Ghost Saint cares only for results, never for the process or the rules!\"\nWith those words, an eerie blue light bloomed, and the door opened.\nLeng Ye stepped out.\nLeaving Su Ping blinking in place.\nWhat?\nGhost Saint?\nDamn it!\nDon’t tell me... *I’m* the one with the powerful connections here?!",

      "content": "Chapter 272: Chapter 163: Just Search the Soul!\nDong Muyun and Lin Lei watched as a figure emerged from the hospital ward, their bodies tensing immediately.\nWhen had this person gone in? How did they get in?\nIt wasn’t until they saw Su Ping coming out afterward that they finally exhaled in relief.\nThen, they turned their strange gaze toward this extremely handsome man.\nWho is this guy?\nIt was Leng Ye, looking quite interested, who glanced at the two hurriedly tensing figures approaching.\nThere was no need to mention Lin Lei, as he had obviously learned about some of Su Ping’s affairs while investigating on the plane.\nAs for Dong Muyun beside him.\nAlthough the Dong Family had fallen on hard times and was no longer the glorious Mirror Saint family that had been passed down from ancient times, there were two talents among this generation’s younger members.\nDong Muyun was one, and that Dong Muxuan from Magic Capital was another.\nSo, before the two could speak, Leng Ye said with a smile,\n\"Miss Dong, drive and take me and the kid for a trip to the Law Enforcement Office! Captain Lin, come along too.\"\n\"Ah? Oh...\"\nDong Muyun was still a bit dazed. Then she saw Su Ping coming up from behind. He nodded at her, and she finally relaxed.\nAlthough she didn’t know why they were going to the Law Enforcement Office, Dong Muyun absolutely trusted Su Ping at this moment.\nBoth were somewhat baffled. One of them was Queen Dong of the Tianyun Group in Jianghai, and the other was a senior military officer in the Legion.\nThe man in front of them, who didn’t seem very old, had an overwhelming presence that suppressed them so much they didn’t even dare to directly question him.\nUpon exiting from the Bright Unicorn Hospital, Dong Muyun summoned her Red King from the Beast Taming Space.\nLin Lei and Dong Muyun sat in the front, while Su Ping and Leng Ye sat in the back.\nAlthough Su Ping didn’t know why this woman’s sports car even had a back seat.\nAt this moment, he couldn’t help feeling sentimental.\n\"Granduncle, could you get me a car when the time comes?\"\nLeng Ye looked at him in surprise.\n\"If you just want this toy, trading it for a thousand or eight hundred wouldn’t be a problem!\"\nSu Ping’s mouth twitched.\nWhat did he want a thousand or eight hundred of these for? To start a supercar club? Wouldn’t that be utterly pointless?\nSu Ping felt awkward and continued to dwell on his Feifei and Black Blood.\nMeanwhile, Dong Muyun’s eyes were filled with bewilderment.\nWhat? Granduncle? Didn’t Su Ping’s grandfather sacrifice himself long ago? In his words, wasn’t his only remaining relative supposedly that somewhat problematic father? Where did this so-called granduncle come from? Related by blood or something else? Was he a brother or a sibling of the previous Su Family elder who had perished in the Beast Tide, or were they related in some other way?\nDong Muyun was a bit baffled, but what puzzled her even more was why this man was going to the Law Enforcement Office.\nMoreover, how did this person know her?\nDid Su Ping say something? Why would Su Ping tell his granduncle about her? Could it be...\nDong Muyun’s expression suddenly became excited.\nIt seemed not impossible after all! At this time, Su Ping was at his most vulnerable. She had been with him all along, and he had told her first after the attack. Does this mean her position in the stubborn kid’s heart has surpassed that of Miss Qin?\nThinking of this, Dong Muyun was all smiles.\nLin Lei, sitting next to her, was somewhat puzzled.\nWas the Dong Family’s miss as calm and dignified as the rumors suggested? It was understandable the first time, but what was this about now?\nFurthermore, Lin Lei couldn’t comprehend another matter.\nJust how did this guy get into Su Ping’s hospital ward?\nHis Pet Beast ’Wild Demon,’ though not summoned, would have sensed any trace with its keen smell and his spiritual power.\nHowever, Lin Lei was actually thinking a bit more than Dong Muyun.\nFor a simple reason: he had witnessed Su Anyong in person.\nHe was the only one who knew Su Anyong’s identity.\nThe special Beastmaster Troops.\nConsidering this, it seemed reasonable that Su Ping’s family would know about his accident, right? And since the father’s generation was already like this, it seemed fitting that the previous generation was more formidable, right? He just didn’t know how formidable they were.\nSu Ping, having recovered from his emotions, took out Feifei’s Mechanical Core.\n\"Sister Yun, is it difficult to repair Feifei’s Mechanical Core?\"\nDong Muyun glanced at Su Ping.\n\"If you want to try, of course, it’s possible. But if you wish, I can get another one for you that won’t be much worse than Black Blood!\"\n\"The car is a small matter. I just want to know if Feifei can still be fixed!\"\n\"Hm?\"\nDong Muyun was slightly startled. \"What do you mean, kid?\"\nSu Ping didn’t bother to hide anything. \"I want to contract it as my Pet Beast when I advance to Commander Level!\"\nDong Muyun frowned, \"Su Ping, I told you before that there’s a problem with this Mechanical Core. It can’t integrate with a mechanical body! What use is a Mechanical Core that can’t integrate with a mechanical body?\"\nThis time, it was Leng Ye’s turn to raise an eyebrow in surprise, glancing at what Su Ping held in his hand.\nA Mechanical Core that can’t integrate with a mechanical body?\nHe had never heard of such a peculiar Mechanical Core before.\nBut Su Ping wasn’t concerned. \"I want to try. No matter what, this little guy saved my life! And to be honest, my first two Pet Beasts are quite strange. If the third one isn’t a bit weird, I’d feel uncomfortable.\"\nThat’s right, a Poison Type mutant Forest Wolf and a Sword Soul little paperman created from Holy Spirit resources. Adding a Mechanical Core that can’t integrate with a mechanical body doesn’t seem strange anymore, does it?\nDong Muyun pursed her lips and finally could only nod, \"Alright, I’ll do my best when the time comes.\"\nAlthough mutant Pet Beasts were indeed quite troublesome.\nSu Ping had thought before that the next Pet Beast he contracted definitely should not be a mutant.\nBut there was no helping it; Su Ping was just that kind of person who valued loyalty and righteousness.\nEven though the spatial transmission was an ability of the Black Blood vehicle, it was Feifei that reminded him in the end, and it was Feifei’s Advanced Level mechanical intelligence that allowed him to escape from the explosion of those mechanical weapons.\nMoreover, Feifei’s Mechanical Core, at most, was just a bit odd; it probably couldn’t be considered a mutant... right?\nOf course, more than that, it was actually Su Ping’s confidence!\nHowever, thinking of Feifei, a cold flash crossed Su Ping’s heart as he thought of the people he was about to meet.\nHe had never felt such resentment towards anyone before.\nBut it had to be said, it was these people who made Su Ping truly understand the deeper, colder, and crueler side of this world of Beast Tamers.\nAnd in Su Ping’s silence, it took less than ten minutes for ’Red King’ to arrive at the Linzhou Law Enforcement Office from the Bright Unicorn Hospital.\nIt was Su Ping’s first time here, but it’s a pity there was absolutely no sense of ceremony.\nEven Dong Muyun and Lin Lei wanted to say a word to the old gatekeeper still present and the front desk receptionist.\nHowever, Leng Ye just smiled, waved his hand, and then strolled in grandly. Neither the old gatekeeper nor the receptionist recording at the front desk seemed to notice anything. They just went about their business, completely unaware that four people had just walked past them.\nHow powerful must one’s spiritual power be?\nLin Lei and Dong Muyun didn’t even have time to be shocked or impressed, as they had already arrived in the only lit interrogation room in the Law Enforcement Office.\nFor the first time, Qin Erlong and Liu Fuhai felt what it was like to be imprisoned. And finally, their time in prison was over!\nThe door of the interrogation room was knocked. Xing Chen, who stood guard by the interrogation room like a door god, finally opened its doors. Four figures entered one by one.\nQin Erlong and Liu Fuhai stood up eagerly, looking at Su Ping and the extremely handsome man leading the group, like students finally seeing their parents.\nHowever, the reaction and demeanor of these two made Dong Muyun and Lin Lei, who were following behind, even more puzzled.\nThe presence of these two here was not surprising, but what was strange was that their reactions and actions seemed as if they had already known about this matter?\nLeng Ye glanced at everyone present and asked straightforwardly, \"Have those international criminals confessed honestly yet?\"\nThe corners of everyone’s mouths twitched.\nWow, weren’t they just suspects? Are they already being branded as criminals?\nHowever, at this moment, it wasn’t just Elders Qin and Liu; even Qin Chuan had now come to understand the situation, his gaze somewhat complicated.\nHe pursed his lips, finally seeing the brat his daughter had mentioned before.\nBut never in his life had Qin Chuan imagined that his first meeting with this potential ’son-in-law’ would be under such circumstances, in such a setting.\nAnd to make things worse was his recent debacle.\nFacing Leng Ye’s enquiry, Qu Ming, the director of the Law Enforcement Office, stepped forward.\n\"Chief, these three international criminals have special identities, and it seems they premeditated their crimes. With our current conditions at the office, we haven’t gotten anything from them yet!\"\nAs he spoke, Qu Ming hurriedly added, \"But rest assured, I am confident!\"\nWhat confidence?\nElders Qin and Liu glanced at him sourly.\nAlthough the Legion and local officials didn’t interfere with each other, and Legion personnel didn’t have jurisdiction here, it still depended on who exactly it was.\nThe person in front of them might indeed hold a position in the Legion. However, strictly speaking, once someone reached this Level, they no longer belonged solely to the Legion.\nAnd in this society of Beast Tamers, one’s personal strength could often determine many things.\nSo, facing this individual, they had no choice but to respond accordingly.\nEven though this was the best commitment Qu Ming could offer, it was clear the Law Enforcement Office had confidence. However, this person might not have the time to wait.\nSo, Leng Ye frowned slightly, glanced at the interrogation room on the monitor, and waved his hand, \"Forget it, there’s no need for all this trouble.\"\nRaising his hand, a pale blue Flame blossomed from his palm. The moment the Flame appeared, the temperature in the room dropped by more than ten degrees. A subdued voice, making everyone’s spine tingle, rose, \"Lan Ling, go to that envoy first and directly conduct a forced Soul Search.\"",

Charles’s Experiment!\nThis azure-blue flame resembled a blue begonia.\nSo beautiful.\nHowever, beneath its beauty lurked an unspeakable, insidious venom.\nSu Ping didn’t know what type of Pet Beast this was, but some among those present did.\nA special and rare Undead, a Fire Elemental Beast Pet: the Blue Flame Heart Demon.\nOf course, an ordinary Blue Flame Heart Demon is a Pet Beast possessing Monarch-level Species Racial Potential.\nTo become the Pet Beast of this individual, it surely couldn’t remain at that level.\nNaturally, the specifics of its evolution were not for them to know.\nBut regardless, the appearance of this creature, along with that softly spoken sentence, made everyone’s heart clench.\nSoul Search!\nA method that sounded common but was, in reality, rarely employed.\nThis was because Pet Beasts capable of performing a Soul Search were indeed few.\nFurthermore, a Soul Search involved directly dismantling the soul to sift through all its memories.\nAfter a Soul Search, the person was usually finished.\nMost importantly, the soul endured extreme pain during the process.\nTo use a relatively common analogy, it was like immersing a human body in a highly corrosive liquid such as sulfuric acid.\nAnd the agony of a Soul Search was akin to soaking the soul in such a substance.\nCountless martyrs, upon capture, chose suicide. One reason was the fear of vital secrets being leaked after a Soul Search; another was that the pain of the process was truly unbearable for the average person.\nIt’s better to die a quick death.\nIf it were an ordinary person, perhaps those present might grit their teeth and attempt a Soul Search.\nHowever, the identities of those apprehended this time were clearly extraordinary. Under such circumstances, perhaps only this individual could so casually suggest, \"force a Soul Search.\"\nBeside him, Qin Chuan’s face was somewhat pale.\nIf, after the Soul Search, Mu Yu and the others all perish here, then what about him...\nBut evidently, at that moment, Qin Chuan could no longer afford to dwell on such thoughts.\n「Inside the interrogation room.」\nHarman was still frowning, looking at the interrogators before him. He seemed to have noticed their outward ferocity masking inner timidity, and he grew even more brazen.\n\"Even in the Magic Capital, your Law Enforcement Office can’t just arbitrarily capture a citizen from Eagle Country! Xie Te, I’m telling you, once I get back to the Magic Capital, I will definitely take you mongrels disguised as dogs to court!\"\nThe interrogators’ faces turned ashen at the insults, but they were helpless.\nAnything on an international level was no small matter.\nSince they hadn’t extracted any information, their capture and interrogation were indeed likely to cause trouble.\nAnd just as everyone glared furiously at Harman, powerless to do anything, Gu Hao walked back in.\nLooking at the captain of the enforcement team, Harman showed no hint of fear. Instead, he sneered,\n\"You! You damned yellow-skinned monkey, an inferior race unworthy of being Beast Tamers! Just you wait until I’m out. You’ll see.\"\nIt had to be said, this time, Harman had truly managed to infuriate everyone.\nThe group of interrogators shot to their feet.\nIf not for the surveillance cameras still running, they might have already summoned their Pet Beasts.\nYet, to their surprise, their captain remained exceptionally calm.\nEven the look he gave Harman was tinged with pity and derision.\nThis kind of gaze made Harman uncomfortable, and he frowned at the man.\nGu Hao said little, not even deeming it necessary to look at Harman again. He turned and bowed to the figure behind him.\nOnly then did everyone see the small, fist-sized blue fire sprout behind Gu Hao.\n\"Lord Lanling, the Soul Search can be conducted at any time!\"\nAt these words, everyone present was stunned.\nHarman blinked. His green eyes, reflecting the slowly drifting blue flame, turned an azure hue.\nIn that instant, Harman seemed to finally register what had been said.\nSoul Search?\n\"No! People of the Dragon Nation! What kind of joke is this? You have no evidence! I really haven’t done anything! I truly don’t know what that damned bombing case has to do with me! What you’re doing is improper! The Eagle Country embassy will never allow you to do this...\"\nHowever, it was clear that neither Leng Ye, calmly observing from outside the surveillance room, nor the ethereal blue flame advancing on Harman, would halt their actions because of his screams.\nFinally, the ethereal blue flame slowly came to a halt before him.\nSimultaneously, the flame swelled, growing from its previous flower-like size until it was as large as a human head.\nWithin the flame, a terrifyingly demonic face seemed to emerge. It wore what looked like a smirk, its gaze fixed greedily on the man before it, as if eager to devour him whole.\n\"No! No! Please! I really haven’t done anything! Spare me... spare me...\"\nHis shrill, terrified screams, lasting less than half a minute, formed a stark contrast to his earlier arrogance.\nThese anguished cries made some interrogators feel a grim satisfaction, while others found it hard to watch.\nHowever, no matter how frightened Harman became, no matter how much he pleaded,\nthe Blue Flame Heart Demon showed no intention of stopping.",

      "content": "Chapter 274: Chapter 164: Qin Chuan’s Panic! Charles’s Experiment!_2\nThe flames flickered and instantly enveloped An Erman’s head. This blonde-haired, blue-eyed Caucasian man seemed to have his entire head engulfed by the blue flames. The shrill howls vanished. Even the flames that wrapped around his head disappeared. Only a faint blue hue still flowed in Harman’s eyes. At the same time, Harman’s body started to twitch violently. Even though the interrogation chair firmly restrained him, the severe twitching still made the chair creak and sway.\n「Meanwhile, outside the interrogation room,」\nLeng Ye extended his hand, and a phantasmal mental image appeared before everyone. As the Blue Flame Heart Demon connected to his soul, all the images it witnessed during the Soul Search were naturally relayed back to Leng Ye’s mind. Everyone focused their minds on the images. It was clear the memory was rewinding, and the scenes reflected by the Blue Flame Heart Demon from the Soul Search were selectively important ones.\n「During his capture,」\nThe scene showed Harman’s astonishment and Mu Yu’s calm. However, just as the rewind began, there seemed to be a problem with the Soul Search process.\nLeng Ye raised an eyebrow slightly. \"Hmm? TSK, amateurish tricks.\"\nBut soon, a shriek, like an insect’s cry, rang out from inside the interrogation room. Then, the Soul Search images began to proceed in an orderly fashion once again.\n\"This is a soul louse egg. Consume it. My body has the Soul Power of Lord Charles...\" Mu Yu said from within the Spirit Barrier as he produced the soul louse egg. \"By ingesting this, everything that happened before will be consumed by the soul lice in your soul. Even if they use Spirit or soul-type abilities, they won’t get anything out of you...\"\nEveryone’s expression changed slightly. At the same time, they all let out a long sigh of relief. These words alone had already proven a great deal. Only Qin Chuan’s face suddenly changed!\nBecause as the Soul Search memories rewound, the scene appeared again:\n\"Lord Mu, that Su Ping has an extraordinary background, and he seems to be somewhat connected with Director Qin’s father...\"\n\"First of all, as long as this matter is taken care of, the rest doesn’t matter. Secondly, Qin Chuan won’t fall out with me; he’s now madly obsessed with joining the Heart of Gold, and only I can speak on his behalf...\"\nEveryone, especially Leng Ye, gave Qin Chuan a calm look. However, the following conversation made him feel even more uneasy.\n\"I have already investigated. Breeder Su’s identity and background are not bad, but he’s still just an elite Breeder. And indeed, the Secret Realm that Qin Chuan mentioned is in Su Ping’s breeding base...\"\nQin Chuan’s face turned extremely pale.\nHe truly hadn’t expected this matter to actually be somewhat related to him? The problem was, the Secret Realms produced in Linzhou these past few years, although relatively concealed, were after all completed products with known whereabouts. This wasn’t a secret! He had never imagined that this could be connected to such a matter.\nYet obviously, at this moment, no one thought this way.\nAt this instant, even Qin Erlong looked at Qin Chuan differently. Disappointment, anger, complexity—it was all there in his gaze.\n\"Dad, I truly didn’t know...\" Qin Chuan began.\n\"Silence!\" Leng Ye’s voice was flat as he continued to watch the images from the Soul Search.\nScenes of clinking glasses and lavish banquets, some with Qin Chuan present and some without, all appeared. Everyone could see clearly, and the more they watched, the clearer the situation became. Dong Muyun, in particular, watched Director Qin with great interest.\nPreviously, when this Director Qin entered Linzhou, he was a formidable enemy to Tianyun. Now it seems that in the future, never mind how the company fares, it remains to be seen if his father can protect this precious son of his. One wonders if Miss Qin knows about the ’effort’ her father put into breaking up her relationship!\nEven Leng Ye slightly narrowed his eyes, thoughtfully mulling over the four words that appeared in the Soul Search memories:\nHeart of Gold?\nThe situation was already quite clear. As the memory continued to rewind, some inconsistencies arose, but for the most part, it was as those present had anticipated.\nUsing ploys to control Beast Tamers, secretly supplying Mechanical Weapons, monitoring Su Ping’s activities at the Breeder Association, planning the attack route and location—even the plans and means for the aftermath had been laid out. What to do with the Sword Seal after dealing with Su Ping, how to handle the various outcomes of different situations... all of this was accomplished in just one afternoon. This level of planning even made Leng Ye nod slightly.\nIndeed, their efficiency was quite impressive!\nIt was just that neither Mu Yu nor Harman had imagined that such an unexpectedly powerful figure lurked behind Su Ping. Of course, it wasn’t just the two of them who were unaware; Su Ping himself was completely oblivious.\n「Finally, the Soul Search memories slowly faded away.」\nPerhaps Leng Ye had achieved his goal. The remaining memories concerned Harman’s affairs in Magic Capital, unrelated to this case, so naturally, there was no interest in continuing to watch.\n「The blue Blue Flame Heart Demon slowly floated up from Harman’s corpse.」",

Charles’s Experiment!_3\nIndeed, a corpse.\nIn the gaze of all present, as Leng Ye’s thoughts flickered, the Blue Flame Heart Demon slowly emerged from Harman’s pupils, dragging out his ethereal soul as well and then devouring it in one gulp.\nThe pitiful and piercing wails made everyone’s teeth chatter.\nThis Ghost Saint truly lived up to his reputation!\nHowever, this Blue Flame Heart Demon also seemed rather peculiar.\nCould it directly devour living souls?\nOf course, at this moment, no one would object, nor did anyone dare to.\nThe strange human face within the Flames appeared exceedingly jubilant, though it seemed not quite sated. Its baleful and greedy eyes covetously surveyed everyone present.\nLeng Ye’s mind moved again, and the Blue Flame Heart Demon flew back to him. Excitedly orbiting Leng Ye, it transformed once again into a tiny Flame.\nYet clearly, a mere Harman was not the end of it!\nIt had been a close call. If Leng Ye hadn’t made preparations in advance, and if Su Ping hadn’t been lucky, the Heavenly Tomb Sword Seal might truly have been lost. Even though the Heavenly Tomb was to the north of Dragon Nation, and with the geographic advantage, it would be difficult for Eagle Country to act rashly. However, losing the Sword Seal was equivalent to losing the initiative.\nIn fact, Leng Ye was well aware of this. Even Dragon Nation was searching for the whereabouts of those keys within the territories of the other two Heavenly Tombs. Eagle Country was watching so closely. The Heavenly Tomb must contain a great secret!\nIt was for this very reason that Harman, the long-time envoy in Dragon Nation, didn’t amount to much. However, Mu Yu, who had returned from Eagle Country, was clearly of far greater importance. Anything involving the Heavenly Tomb was naturally no trivial matter. Moreover, Leng Ye was curious:\nWhat exactly is inside the Heavenly Tomb?\nAlthough Mu Yu might not necessarily know, having just one more source of intelligence was of tremendous value to Dragon Nation. Now, with such an opportunity and excuse presenting itself—his visitors practically delivering themselves to his doorstep—he couldn’t be happier!\nSo, after playing with the Blue Flame Heart Demon for a bit, Leng Ye thought for a moment and walked directly into the interrogation room.\nCompared to Harman’s earlier provocations, Mu Yu at this moment was extremely quiet, even a little too quiet. He was silent, his breathing becoming slightly rapid.\nHe didn’t know what exactly had happened, but Mu Yu knew one thing for sure.\nThe soul louse is dead!\nThe soul louse I left inside Harman... it’s dead!\nThe implications... they were undeniable.\nIf Harman had simply died along with it, that would have been one thing. But if Harman hadn’t died, or if he had spilled the beans before dying, then the outcome would be self-evident.\nIn fact, if the Heavenly Tomb Sword Seal had already been obtained, I wouldn’t have cared so much.\nIf I die, I die.\nEven I had made certain preparations for this trip to Dragon Nation. I even had some expectations.\nHowever, what I’m worried about is that Lord Charles’s task hasn’t been completed!\nThe Sword Seal!\nMatters concerning the Heavenly Tomb were, for Mu Yu, currently more important than his own life.\nSo, at this moment, a sliver of wishful thinking sparked in Mu Yu’s heart.\nEven if Su Ping is fine,\nhe thought,\nthey won’t know my true purpose. They’ll think all I wanted was his Paperman. If that’s the case, then obviously, things can still be salvaged. In the future, Eagle Country might still have a chance to get the Heavenly Tomb Sword Seal.\nHowever, in the next second, that sliver of wishful thinking in Mu Yu’s heart was utterly shattered, leaving not a trace behind.\nFor into the interrogation room walked a figure.\nA figure he had seen before in photographs.\nThis figure’s face was one that required close attention from Eagle Country.\nHow could he be here?\nMu Yu’s eyes bulged.\nThe one who understands you best is always your enemy.\nEven within Dragon Nation, very few had truly seen Leng Ye or knew of the Ghost Saint. But now, Mu Yu recognized at first glance who the newcomer was. He also understood now why the soul louse he had been so confident in had been detected and eradicated.\nIf this personage himself has come, then everything makes sense.\nLeng Ye looked at him, a smile in his eyes, and said, \"Judging by your expression, it seems you know who I am, eh? TSK, TSK. To go to such lengths, all for this thing?\"\nMu Yu looked in despair at the Heavenly Tomb Sword Seal that had appeared in Leng Ye’s hands.\nAs expected! With him here, it would be truly unbelievable if the matter of the Sword Seal could still be concealed.\nAlthough he had anticipated this, upon seeing the item, the breath Mu Yu had been holding, the tension he’d maintained, completely deflated.\nMu Yu lifted his head, his expression one of complete resignation, and said, \"Leng Sheng, if you have anything you want to ask, just speak directly!\"\n\"Something I want to ask?\" Leng Ye chuckled. \"Question you? I never question living enemies. Corpses and souls are far more truthful!\"\nMu Yu froze. Then, a flash of deep blue instantly enveloped his entire field of vision.\n\"AHHH...\"\nThe equally agonized howls didn’t cause the slightest flicker of emotion in Leng Ye. Soon, however, his eyebrows knitted together slightly. He looked at what was before him.\nAnd at that moment, within the interrogation room, a light flared. The Blue Flame Heart Demon was forcibly ejected from Mu Yu’s body.",

      "content": "Chapter 276: Chapter 164: Qin Chuan’s Panic! Charles’s Experiment!_4\nMeanwhile, Mu Yu’s pupils turned pitch black. He faced Leng Ye, even baring a smile. His teeth, eyeballs, and the whites of his eyes all became exceedingly dark. At this moment, Mu Yu seemed to not be human anymore. In fact, that seemed to indeed be the case, because at this moment, an extremely unique voice rang out, \"Leng? Long time no see!\"\nLeng Ye slightly narrowed his eyes, looking at Mu Yu, whose muscles all over his body were starting to atrophy, becoming even more withered. At this moment, Mu Yu’s body seemed to have turned into a skeleton, and all over him, at a speed visible to the naked eye, turned charred black. Only within those dark pupils was there still a glimmer of light.\nNot to mention Su Ping, at this very moment, everyone outside the interrogation room, monitoring and perceiving this scene, felt a chill in their hearts.\nWhat kind of technique was this? Was this the ability of a truly Advanced Level Beast Tamer in this world?\nHowever, at this instant, everything in the interrogation room was shrouded. Whether it was the people outside or the others inside the interrogation room, no one could see clearly anymore what was happening before them.\nAfter doing all this, Leng Ye then said, \"Charles? Tsk, there have been ongoing rumors of your death, yet here you are, not dead. I wonder what means you used to cling to life, you old thing?\" Leng Ye smiled, taking an apparent interest in this ’thing.’\nCharles was not bothered, seeming as if he had only just received all the information, conversing as if with an old friend, \"If you, Leng, or the Legendary Lord of Dragon Nation, want such a Secret Technique, you can come find me in Eagle Country. I, Charles, certainly won’t be stingy with my dearest friends and revered idols. By the way, has the Sword Mark of the Heavenly Tomb in Dragon Nation been found?\"\nLeng Ye chuckled lightly, paying no heed to the other’s trivial words, instead pondering over the current situation.\n\"Indeed, when I sensed through the Heavenly Tomb that a key from Dragon Nation’s Heavenly Tomb might have emerged, I had a premonition. The strategies and tactics you people of Dragon Nation excel in. This move should be called luring the snake out of its hole, right?\"\nLeng Ye showed no reaction, tacitly accepting the other party’s flattering over-interpretation. Even the sarcastic smile on the corner of his mouth did not waver, as he casually said, \"Pity, no big fish were hooked!\"\n\"Heh, good enough. Mu was almost really killed in Dragon Nation.\"\nLeng Ye frowned slightly, glancing at Mu Yu’s body, which in that short time had almost turned into a desiccated skeleton; his frown deepened.\nMu Yu wasn’t dead yet? Sure enough, for Charles to speak like this, he must have truly left some contingencies in place.\n\"It’s just a pity that Mu’s body is too frail, and the remaining spiritual power is not sufficient to support it. Otherwise, I would have really liked to talk more with you, my dearest friend.\"\nLeng Ye sneered coldly. Beside him, not only did that wisp of dark blue flame continue to appear, but behind him, a single blood-red pupil also materialized.\n\"Dear Leng, what are you doing? I really just wanted to talk to you. Now, you should know, this is not the real me. If you make a move now, aside from destroying some buildings and machinery of Dragon Nation, it’s meaningless.\" The figure didn’t care about Leng Ye’s actions at the moment and continued to speak quickly, as if truly short on time, \"I know Dragon Nation has always been curious about what’s inside the Heavenly Tomb. So, do you know why, despite guessing that this was Dragon Nation’s ’luring the snake out of the hole,’ I still sent Mu here? In fact, Mu’s death this time is the final step in the completion of one of the Heavenly Tomb’s experimental results! Dear Leng, until we meet again. I’m truly looking forward to discovering what other secrets lie within Dragon Nation’s Heavenly Tomb.\"\n\"Whatever secrets there are, they have nothing to do with you!\"\nThe Darkness receded. All the aberrations vanished. The aura on Mu Yu’s body disappeared without a trace, including the aura of life. Leng Ye’s brows furrowed as he stared at Mu Yu’s corpse, which had turned into a mummy, falling into contemplation. Indeed, once the Blue Flame Heart Demon re-entered Mu Yu’s corpse, there was no longer any trace of life or Soul Breath. The body before him was indeed as dead as could be.\nThe problem still lay in what Charles had said earlier. What did it really mean? Could the gains from the Heavenly Tomb in Eagle Country allow Mu Yu to resurrect under such circumstances?\nAt this thought, a hint of interest appeared at the corners of his mouth. As Charles had said, if the Heavenly Tomb in Eagle Country contained such gains,\nthen what secrets lay within the Heavenly Tomb on Blue Star?\nThe pitch-black Darkness vanished. The situation in the interrogation room reappeared before everyone’s eyes. Su Ping looked dubiously at Leng Ye as he walked out of the interrogation room. Although the latter’s expression had returned to normal, Su Ping could still tell that something unexpected must have happened in the past few moments. However, in the footage, Mu Yu, who had turned into a charred skeleton, indeed showed no sign of life anymore.\nWhat exactly had happened just now?\nSu Ping did not know, and it was clear that Leng Ye had no intention of explaining.\nAt this point, it was Qu Ming from the Law Enforcement Office who mustered up the courage to ask, \"Sir, how should we proceed with that?\"\nLeng Ye looked up and glanced at the last interrogation room. Inside was none other than the last person brought by Mu Yu: his apprentice, Chris. Leng Ye’s brows tightened slightly. Instead of answering, he simply nudged the blue flame resting on his shoulder to move again. Piercing howls erupted once more, but they did not cause any change in the expressions of the people present. Because everyone knew that at this time, it wasn’t over yet!\nMu Yu and his two companions were dead. The situation was now clear. So, with these three dead, and all prior Soul Searches preserved, their criminal acts were as good as proven. Even if confronted by people from Eagle Country, they could say nothing in their defense. The use of Mechanical Weapons, and within the urban limits of Dragon Nation at that—what this implied was self-explanatory. This was Eagle Country; if it had involved some relatively small neighboring countries, given the temperament of those in charge in Dragon Nation, they would even have had grounds to dispatch troops directly.\nBut though they were dead, it didn’t mean everything was settled, because at this very moment, another anxious figure sat in the room. Qin Chuan’s lips had turned a bit pale. Because in the silence of that moment, he could feel that gaze slowly shifting towards him.\nClearly, how would Qin Chuan be dealt with in this situation?\nAt that moment, Leng Ye’s voice also rang out, sounding like the Grim Reaper’s decree as he said, \"In consideration of Sang Sheng’s reputation, I can give you a chance to explain.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 277: Chapter 165: Demands That Can Be Made Casually!\nHe was given an opportunity to explain.\nQin Chuan pursed his lips, sweat already forming on his forehead.\nBecause he knew that in the Magic Capital, countless people showed him respect because of his mother’s presence. But today was different. And undoubtedly, the words spoken by the man before him were definitely not a joke. If his explanation wasn’t satisfactory, this man would not be ambiguous!\nQin Chuan said powerlessly, \"Ghost Saint, I really didn’t know that this matter was related to Su Ping, and the things that Mu Yu was asking about were also trivial matters! Please believe me...\"\nSu Ping wanted to speak, but a strand of cold that enveloped his body rendered him voiceless.\nOnly then did Leng Ye indifferently say, \"Being overly intimate with people from Eagle Country, even wishing to join some ’Heart of Gold’ organization of theirs, do you really want to rid yourself of Dragon Nation that much? What’s next, are you planning to change your nationality?\"\nUpon hearing this, Qin Chuan’s complexion turned even paler, but he had no explanation to offer. Because what was said was the truth.\n\"Relying on the relationship and background of Sang Sheng and President Qin, your Ability, using the resources of Dragon Nation, and then you go seeking an organization from Eagle Country? I now suspect whether this is your idea, or perhaps even Sang Sheng or President Qin has a change of heart?\"\nWith these words, not just Qin Chuan, but even Qin Erlong by his side turned pale.\nThis accusation was too severe. So severe that even he wouldn’t dare be stained by it, much less his own wife.\n\"Ghost Saint, Qin Chuan has only been in touch with Eagle Country for a while,\" Qin Erlong said. \"I can put my life on the line to guarantee that he holds no second heart towards Dragon Nation! Qin Chuan merely didn’t want to be under the protection of me and Ah Sang. Please understand. I can assure you, such an incident will absolutely not happen again.\"\n\"Your guarantee...\"\nLeng Ye let out a disdainful laugh but did not continue speaking, the implication hanging in the air.\nHowever, at that moment, Su Ping finally realized that the piercing cold that had prevented him from speaking had vanished.\nHe now understood his second great-uncle’s well-meant intentions.\nHe feigned a light cough and said, \"Second great-uncle, I think this matter shouldn’t involve Old Qin, and President Qin truly didn’t know about Mu Yu’s affairs. How about we let it go?\"\nSecond great-uncle?\nIt was the first time Su Ping used this term in front of Qin Erlong and Liu Fuhai.\nIn that moment, the doubts that had lingered in their minds were immediately resolved. But then, a bigger doubt surged forward.\nHow had this Ghost Saint become this youngster’s second great-uncle? They had always prided themselves on knowing Su Ping for a long time, understanding him quite well. Where had this kid gotten such immense familial influence? They had no idea.\nAnd by his side, Qin Chuan had also become numb.\nOnce again, he looked at this young man with a complexity of emotions, uncertain of how to express himself.\nNaturally, Leng Ye had no intention of actually dealing with Qin Chuan.\nAlthough he often acted with reckless abandon, that was on a personal level. As for Qin Chuan, well, that might be fine, but the individual from the Magic Capital involved the whole Dragon Nation. Educational reforms were absolutely necessary. The changes in the Rules for professional Beast Tamer examinations. The support for Beast Tamers from humble backgrounds after graduating from Basic Beastmaster Academies. As well as the enrollment Rules and restrictions of the Advanced Beastmaster Academies. A slew of policy changes needed to be tried and updated. The one from the Magic Capital was at the forefront of it all. To deal with his son so harshly at a time like that would indeed involve too much.\nHowever, while a death penalty might be spared, a lesser punishment was unavoidable, especially for someone like Qin Chuan, an ungrateful brat who returned after years abroad without recognizing his Ancestors. Leng Ye indeed had no regard for such a fellow. Enjoying the resources on Dragon Nation’s side, his parents in high positions, yet still thinking about ingratiating himself with the people of Eagle Country? If it were his own kid, Leng Ye wouldn’t waste words and would have Lanling eat him instead.\nSo, the purpose of this conversation was to give him a warning.\nIt hardly mattered whether Qin Chuan lived or died, or even what happened to his parents from Leng Ye’s perspective.\nBut nothing could go wrong with Dragon Nation’s upcoming major strategies!\nSo, although he disliked the situation, Leng Ye uncharacteristically refrained from taking action. Of course, this also gave the youngster some face and a favor.\nAfter all, Qin Erlong held absolute authority in Linzhou and Jianghai. There were many matters in Jianghai that he, still in Beiyuan, couldn’t reach.\nTherefore, upon hearing Su Ping’s words, he also followed the path of least resistance, thought for a moment, and then nodded. \"Fine then, for your sake, let’s drop it. But if there’s even a hint of this again, don’t blame me for not being polite!\"\nAfter saying this, he didn’t wait for the others to react, gave Su Ping a look, and led the way out of the interrogation room.\nSu Ping smiled helplessly and then gestured to Qin Erlong and Liu Fuhai, \"Old Qin, Old Liu, I’ll come find you for tea when I have the time.\"\nOld Liu waved his hands with a cheery smile, feeling entirely at ease.\nBy his side, Qin Erlong quickly propped up a smile and waved his hands. After Su Ping, along with Dong Muyun and Lin Lei (who had been spectating the entire time), left, his expression finally sunk into a complete gloom.\nLiu Fuhai glanced at Qin Erlong, then at Qin Chuan. This time, he did not speak and left first, not even accompanying Qin Erlong further.\nThe others were perceptive as well. All the interrogators leaving the interrogation room, including Captain Gu Hao and Director Qu Ming, hurriedly exited.\nFor a moment, within the interrogation room, only the father and son remained.\nQin Erlong looked at the slowly emerging dawn’s light through the window of the interrogation room.\n「A whole night had passed.」\nThis night was the most memorable and difficult one for Old Qin in more than a decade. Because on one hand was his son, and on the other was the younger generation he was most optimistic about—and before this, their relationship could have potentially become even closer. But after this night, the future was uncertain.\nEven though, in reality, his actual subjective relationship with Qin Chuan was indeed not great. Nevertheless, Qin Chuan unknowingly provided Mu Yu with information that almost led to Su Ping’s death, and that was a fact.\nAnd the arrival of the Ghost Saint was something he had never imagined.\nSo, looking at the distant, pale Sky Dome of dawn, Qin Erlong finally said, \"I won’t tell Xiao Xue about this. There’s no need for her to end up like you, hating your own parents for a lifetime.\"\nThe first sentence made Qin Chuan purse his lips.\n\"But you won’t be able to hide it from your mother, so prepare yourself. Take the initiative and tell her later, then admit whatever mistakes you should admit. Sell that damn company of yours or give it away. Then go to the Magic Capital and be a teacher!\"\n\"Dad!\" Qin Chuan instinctively spoke out, his eyes filled with reluctance. But in the end, he could only lower his head. \"I understand.\"\nBecause he knew that this time, it wasn’t his parents making him do it. The person just now definitely wouldn’t discuss mercy with him.\nSo, under Qin Erlong’s gaze, Qin Chuan took out his phone. He dialed the number he never wanted to call in his life.\n\"Hello, I never thought there would come a day when you would actually call me first...\"\n\"...\"\nSu Ping didn’t know the situation inside the interrogation room, but he could guess some of it.\nIn fact, he couldn’t understand why Qin Xiaoxue would have such a father? But no matter what, for the sake of Miss Qin, he wouldn’t take any drastic actions, especially since Qin Erlong had been very good to him. As for Qin Chuan, Su Ping held no resentment, only curiosity.\nNoticing his confusion on the way back, Leng Ye chuckled, \"Don’t look so perplexed. That woman from the Magic Capital isn’t too vicious, but she has a strong desire for control. In his younger years, everything in this Qin Family kid’s life was arranged for him. Until it came to the major matter of marriage.\"\nLeng Ye clicked his tongue and said, \"In short, it’s a dramatic mess. Because of a woman and a marriage partner, this Qin Family kid, after many years of pent-up frustration, completely fell out with his family. However, in the end, he submitted to his mother’s dominance. Then it’s said some muddled things happened afterward; apparently his wife died, and then he left the country for a few years.\"\nObviously, Leng Ye had no interest in these affairs, only mentioning it briefly before changing the subject with Su Ping. \"If you want to know about their messed-up family squabbles, you can ask someone else in the future. Once we finish this last job, I’ll head back to Beiyuan.\"\nPausing, Leng Ye continued, \"You can rest assured, there shouldn’t be anyone coming after you for the Heavenly Tomb Sword Seal anymore. Charles believes Dragon Nation is trying to lure him out. He also likely believes he knows where the *real* Heavenly Tomb Sword Seal is now. Su Ping, you’re the decoy with the ’treasure.’ Once your role as bait is fully exposed or understood by the enemy, you’ll paradoxically attract less direct attention for it.\"\n\"Of course, you still need to be cautious, but I reckon, for the time being, your protection here shouldn’t be your concern anymore.\"\nLeng Ye was correct; the Legion and the two major associations would probably focus on this. Even further development of Linzhou’s suburbs was possible.\n「A night passed quietly.」\nStanding at the door of Heart of Woods, looking at the slowly rising sun and morning glow in the distance, Su Ping truly felt as if he had experienced a lifetime apart.\nA lot had indeed happened over the night.\nAfter not returning for a night, Su Ping led Leng Ye into the guest room of Heart of Woods.\nSeeing Su Ping, who was still a bit dazed, the latter said directly, \"Kid, you can slowly savor this later on. The path of growing as a Beast Tamer can’t possibly be smooth sailing, but now, you can make your requests! Go ahead, anything!\"\nHe didn’t at all conceal the value of the Heavenly Tomb Sword Seal from Su Ping. He even directly offered Su Ping such generous terms. He was even genuinely afraid that Su Ping would sell himself short. After all, this was, in a way, his own kid. So, Leng Ye was very generous.\nDemands! Ask for anything!\nIt must be said, at that moment, Su Ping’s mind was indeed filled with various demands. High-level resources, Pet Beast cubs with super high Racial Potential. Even various Pet Beast Cultivation and Evolution methods, among other miscellaneous requests. After all, this was the time to make extravagant demands!",

      "content": "Chapter 278: Chapter 166: Su Ping’s Demand! Feifei Repairs!\nMagic Capital, Advanced Beastmaster Academy.\nInside the personal villa belonging to the esteemed Sang Sheng, a woman sat cross-legged atop the rooftop terrace.\nEven though it was deep autumn, on the cusp of winter, her courtyard remained lush and green, full of vibrant life.\nAs the woman sat there, with each breath she took, the surrounding greenery seemed to slowly unfurl its branches and leaves. Bathed in the rising sun, it appeared lush and verdant.\nFinally, the woman slowly opened her eyes, her indifferent pupils gazing into the rising sun without the slightest hint of being dazzled.\nAt this moment, the woman’s entire body trembled slightly.\nIt was as if, in that instant, she transformed into a gigantic plant. Countless branches and leaves followed the rhythm of her breathing, swaying with her thoughts.\nThis continued for more than half an hour before she returned to her normal state.\nThe woman stood up and walked back to the first floor.\nIn the dining room, her breakfast had already been prepared.\nIt was a bowl of ’vegetable salad.’\nEven after reaching her cultivation Realm, her dietary requirements had greatly diminished. Especially when practicing the Forest of Myriad Forms Meditation Method, she could draw sufficient nutrients from sunlight and oxygen alone.\nHowever, the woman had still formed this habit.\nThough called a ’vegetable salad,’ the dish actually contained no salad dressing, only various plant leaves and twigs. Some were edible, while others, strictly speaking, weren’t considered food.\nCarefully savoring the taste and texture of each plant fiber aided her cultivation and her understanding of Pet Beasts.\nA habit formed over many years wasn’t going to change.\nUnfortunately, today, the woman seemed somewhat distracted.\nShe was already aware of Qin Chuan’s situation. Such a significant event had occurred in Linzhou, something she herself had not anticipated. But it had happened. Getting angry or blaming someone was not in her character.\nOf course, the matter now seemed to be resolved to Perfection, so she didn’t need to intervene.\nOnly now, she had started to doubt something.\nA phone call this morning, after Qin Erlong and Qin Chuan had called to apologize, brought her some news.\nThat young man from Linzhou, Su Ping, now apparently had a ’second grandfather’ surnamed Leng.\nThe woman found herself speechless.\nCould her words truly have become a self-fulfilling prophecy? Would Qin Erlong eventually call, claiming that young man was the illegitimate child of the Legend of the Holy Dragon?\nShaking her head, the woman let out a helpless sigh.\nHowever, she wasn’t particularly angry, even though she had indeed felt a surge of fury upon hearing Qin Chuan’s words.\nBut after calming down for a moment, she considered it might even be a good thing. For Qin Chuan, this was indeed a major setback in his life. All his past efforts and the company he had built were now in ruins. But in truth, to her, that blasted Dachuan Real Estate meant nothing; it wasn’t even worth a sideways glance. At least this had quieted him down and, at the same time, removed his inclination to stay in contact with those from Eagle Country. This was far better than him potentially committing a catastrophic mistake in the future.\nThus, she wasn’t really angry.\nHer thoughts now turned to how she might mend her relationship with that young man.\nPreviously, when Qin Erlong and Xiao Xue had been optimistic about him, the woman hadn’t particularly cared but hadn’t objected either.\nBut now, even though she still found it all rather surreal, she couldn’t help but revise her assessment of this young man—whom she had never even met—upwards again, for what felt like the umpteenth time.\nWith that in mind, the woman made a phone call to Qin Xiaoxue.\n\"Xiao Xue, Su Ping’s second Pet Beast, you mentioned before that it’s of the Necromancy Series, right?\"\n\"Ah? Yes... yes, that’s right...\"\nQin Xiaoxue’s voice sounded somewhat guilty.\nIn her view, Su Ping had chosen his second Pet Beast from the Necromancy Series because of her suggestion. She had previously told Su Ping about her desire to try two Meditation Methods from Magic Capital: ’Forest of Myriad Forms’ and ’Union of Myriad Transformations.’ This meant his second Pet Beast would need to be either a pure Wood Element, Plant Type Pet Beast, or an Undead Pet Beast. But undoubtedly, this was against the rules.\nNow, hearing the old lady suddenly inquire, she instantly thought she was about to be reprimanded. Qin Xiaoxue also wondered who could have told the old lady about this.\nHowever, unexpectedly, the anticipated reprimand from the old lady didn’t come. Instead, she just nodded and continued with a smile, \"Vacation starts in a month. Don’t forget to tell Su Ping to come to Magic Capital then to see your Woodhead’s Evolution...\"\n\"Yeah, I’ve already told Su Ping.\"\n\"Alright, that’s all. Go to class. You’re entering the Linhai Secret Realm today, right? Be prepared and don’t get hurt.\"\n\"Mmm, I know, don’t worry, Grandma!\"\nAfter hanging up, Qin Xiaoxue scratched her head, a little confused about what her grandmother meant.\nMeanwhile, the woman, having hung up, made another call.\nShortly after, a woman walked into the dining room, \"Headmistress.\"\nUpon seeing the newcomer, the woman smiled lightly, \"Xiao Qin, do me a favor. Go to Linzhou and deliver something for me.\"\n\"Yes!\"\n...\nSu Ping waved at the oddly-shaped aircraft as it slowly ascended into the sky.\nIn just an instant, the Sky-splitter disappeared from view.\nIt’s to be expected, after all.",

Feifei Repairs!_2\nBeing able to travel from Beiyuan to Jianghai in less than two hours.\nWhat did that even mean?\nSo, watching the disappearing Sky-splitter, Su Ping once again showed a hint of envy.\nNext to him, Dong Muyun, seeing the look of envy on Su Ping’s face, said oddly, \"Kid, I can’t get that thing for you. If you want it, you’ll have to work hard yourself!\"\nSu Ping curled his lips. He didn’t plan on thinking about it for a while.\nGood grief, Spirit Saint Level.\nIf reaching that level were so easy, then Spirit Saint Level Beast Tamers wouldn’t be so rare all over the world, nor would they have such a high status in Dragon Nation.\nSince ancient times, those who have reached that level have been as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.\nSeeing that Su Ping wasn’t paying him any attention, Dong Muyun didn’t mind and also said with considerable admiration and emotion, \"Ghost Saint is truly powerful!\"\n\"But speaking of which, why did Ghost Saint look at you so weirdly before he left?\" Dong Muyun seemed to recall something and looked at Su Ping with surprise.\nSu Ping touched his nose somewhat awkwardly upon hearing this. \"\nReally? Was it because I asked for too much? But it was Leng Ye who told me to make any demand I wanted. And didn’t he outright refuse in the end!? Damn it! He clearly said I could name any price, and yet when I mentioned several Mythical Level and Legendary Level Pet Beast cubs, not only did he refuse, but I even got hit for it.\n\"\nThinking about this, Su Ping was filled with righteous indignation.\nIn the end, despite not gaining any substantial benefits, it seemed as if he had somehow offended the other party greatly and deeply aggrieved him. Is there anyone else in this world like him?\nIndeed, the value of the Heavenly Tomb Sword Seal is very high. Considering how desperately the people from Eagle Country were after it, it must be valuable. And Leng Ye did indeed give him the power to ask for a hefty price. However, apart from those Pet Beast cubs that didn’t seem very relevant, Su Ping didn’t really want anything else. In fact, even if there were those Legendary Spirit Saint Level cubs, Su Ping wasn’t particularly interested in them. At best, it was just boasting. With the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas at hand, Su Ping was naturally unsuited for those exceptionally High-level, extremely rare special Pet Beasts. He wasn’t too interested in those naturally divine and holy Pet Beasts either. Of course, if he could research them and see if he could devolve those Pet Beasts, Su Ping would be quite interested. But to waste such a precious opportunity on experimental subjects whose success he wasn’t sure of... Su Ping didn’t feel so extravagant.\n\"\nSo, after tossing and turning with the thought all morning, Su Ping, damn it, still couldn’t think of anything he actually needed.\nAdvanced Level materials like Soul Seed or Sword Intent Origin? What use would they be to him? For his Paperman to continue using? There’s no need for that for the time being! As for Xiao Qing’s evolution, that’s even more of a mystery; he had no clue what materials it might require, not even Su Ping himself knew.\n\"\nThus, Su Ping, who had been prepared to make a huge demand, ultimately couldn’t figure out what he really needed.\nHe did indeed need some things, like resources to quickly enhance his own Realm. But although those resources were scarce, Su Ping himself felt it would be a waste to use such an opportunity for them. He could exchange for them at either the Breeder Association or in the Legion, so why waste this chance?\n\"\nTherefore, after much consideration, Su Ping simply made a very special, basic request.\nAs the saying goes, it’s better to teach a man to fish than to give him a fish!\nFor Su Ping, a momentary precious Spirit Saint, or even Legendary Level resource, was indeed valuable, but it might not provide much help to him at present, especially when it comes to the critically important Realm advancement of a Beast Tamer.\n\"\nSo, Su Ping’s condition was: Secret Realm Exploration!\nSu Ping’s \"fishing skill\" was his Beast Taming Space characteristic, which normally didn’t have much opportunity to be utilized.\nThe Space Element Resource Type characteristic: Space Absorption!\nSu Ping had never forgotten about this.\nFor a Beast Tamer, Pet Beasts are their combat power, but the true foundation of a powerful Beast Tamer is always their Beast Taming Space.\nA Beast Tamer’s Beast Taming Space is also one of their fundamentals.\nSu Ping’s Realm was too low, and currently, his Beast Taming Space couldn’t yet effectively nurture or cultivate too Advanced Level resources.\nBut that wouldn’t always be the case in the future.\nMoreover, with the Space Absorption ability, it was even possible to absorb residual origin characteristics from other Secret Realms and assimilate them into his own space characteristics.\nFor Su Ping, the potential that this space characteristic brought to his Beast Taming Space was unlimited.\nUnfortunately, there hadn’t been many Secret Realms appearing, leaving this space characteristic with no real use!\nBut now, an opportunity had undoubtedly arisen.\nThe situation with Secret Realms was complex, as Leng Ye had said.\nUnder normal circumstances, Secret Realms are categorized as renewable and non-renewable.\nIf it’s renewable, then it’s truly precious.\nThe energy in such a Secret Realm can be cyclically regenerated. Even if the owner dies, the Beast Taming Space that formed the Secret Realm will still have effective space characteristics and resources.\nMany of Dragon Nation’s High Order resources are produced this way.\nTypically, such Secret Realms can also exist stably for a long time.\nAfter all, Dragon Nation and the local forces would carefully preserve and maintain these Secret Realms.",

Their energy only depletes without replenishment.\nSuch Secret Realms do not have a guaranteed existence. Some, like the Fengdu Sword King’s Secret Realm, collapse almost instantaneously.\nOthers may last for a year or two, perhaps even three to five years, but there is no certainty.\nOnce they appear, Beast Tamers go in for a quick plunder before retreating.\nAs for when they will collapse, if they pose some danger and are too close to populated areas, measures would be taken to deliberately trigger their destruction sooner.\nIf they are not particularly dangerous, they would simply be left as is, without much interference.\nClearly, Secret Realms that can continuously regenerate resources are treasured in any region.\nFor those, if Su Ping were to enter and begin absorbing spatial Origin Traits, even with Leng Ye there, he would undoubtedly get killed.\nHowever, those non-renewable Secret Realms that are quickly plundered are evidently different.\nLeaving such Secret Realms to collapse in the void is a waste; isn’t it fair for them to contribute some power in the end?\nSu Ping didn’t think it was excessive.\nRegrettably, under the laws of Dragon Nation, not just anyone can access these types of Secret Realms.\nMore importantly, not just anyone can find them.\nUnless one has a Space-based Pet Beast with extremely sensitive perception like Dong Muyun, maybe then they can sense these fluctuations and locate the Secret Realms. Otherwise, it would be like finding a needle in a haystack.\nWithout a doubt, Su Ping did not possess such a Pet Beast, and even if he did, it would be only slightly better than looking for a needle in the ocean.\nThe most direct and efficient method, of course, is to leverage the government’s power to search for these Secret Realm resources, giving oneself the information and identity necessary to enter!\nIndeed, that was the condition Su Ping finally offered to Leng Ye.\nTherefore, Su Ping felt that the look Leng Ye gave him when he left wasn’t disdain for asking too high a price, but too low! Su Ping flattered himself, thinking that exemplary youths like him who contribute to the nation’s development were truly rare!\nAfter all, Leng Ye did say, when leaving, that Su Ping could come to him if there was anything else.\nThis promise was more precious than many conditions.\nShaking his head, Su Ping wondered when Leng Ye would be able to sort things out.\nSu Ping had always been looking forward to the development of the Beast Taming Space.\nOnce the Beast Taming Space was enriched, the ability to produce some resources would be the true foundation of a Beast Tamer.\nSo, the conclusion was still the same old saying: giving a man a fish is not as good as teaching a man to fish.\nDong Muyun paid no attention to Su Ping’s showmanship.\nShe didn’t even delve into what exactly was going on between Su Ping and Leng Ye.\nInstead, she spoke directly:\n\"I have something to tell you. Dachuan Real Estate was sold to our Pingyun Company for the price of five hundred million!\"\n\"Hmm? Ah?\"\nSu Ping looked at her suspiciously.\nHe certainly knew that Dachuan Real Estate was Qin Chuan’s business, but he hadn’t expected things to move so fast!\nIt had only been a day!\nAnd five hundred million? Wasn’t that too cheap?\nNot to say it was a giveaway, but it was almost there. Not to mention other things, just the several land deeds Dachuan Real Estate had secured in Linzhou during this period alone must be worth more than five hundred million, right?\n\"I agreed to this transaction without seeking your approval. You’re not going to blame me, are you?\"\nSu Ping gave Queen Dong an odd look. She was acting unusually coy. \"I’ve already said that you have the administrative rights to the company,\" he replied.\nDong Muyun feigned a wistful head shake and said:\n\"That’s true, but since Qin Chuan is Miss Qin’s father, if you blame me out of regard for Miss Qin, this young lady can only silently bear it.\"\nSu Ping gave the woman a speechless glance.\nAs they became more familiar with each other, is this woman revealing her true nature more and more?\nHowever, he didn’t continue to speak.\nQin Chuan is Qin Chuan, and Qin Xiaoxue is Qin Xiaoxue. The help Miss Qin provided, especially from the Stone of Creation, was extraordinarily significant to me. Therefore, if Qin Chuan’s actions were truly unintentional, I wouldn’t take it out on others.\nAs for Qin Chuan himself, I have no comment.\nBut as for Dong Muyun, her visit this time was undoubtedly for some serious business:\n\"By the way, there’s more, your Mechanical Core has been repaired!\"\n\"Hmm?!\"\nSu Ping’s eyes lit up, \"That fast?\"\n\"When it comes to matters concerning Director Su, how could a humble worker like me not handle them properly?\"\nSu Ping frowned slightly, \"Can’t you speak properly anymore?\"\nDong Muyun rolled her eyes at him, then continued:\n\"This Mechanical Core’s self-intelligence is much higher than that of a typical newly-born Mechanical Pet Beast.\nFollowing the explosion of that mechanical weapon, it used its hardest part to face the blast. At the same time, it was protected by Black Blood’s mechanical shell!\"\n\"So, it wasn’t affected too much. Naturally, using specialized restoration methods for these kinds of things and consuming some resources wasn’t too difficult.\"\nDong Muyun spoke lightly, but Su Ping knew that it must have still cost quite a bit.\nHowever, he didn’t say much.\nIt was Dong Muyun who continued with interest:\n\"As for your Third Pet Beast, if you want to choose this item, you’d better think it through!\nMechanical Pet Beasts are different from all other Pet Beasts. Do you have any familiar Mechanists? Do you want me to introduce you to one?\nOr maybe I could just sell you some mechanical blueprints at an internal price from Tianyun?\"\nMechanists, mechanical blueprints?\nSu Ping scratched his head.\nAdmittedly, I’m not very familiar with Mechanical Pet Beasts, a luxury type of Pet Beast.\n\"However, your Pet Beast can’t merge with a mechanical body. Blueprints and the like are also unnecessary. If you ask me, if you want to contract a Mechanical Pet Beast, why choose such a one?\nIf you wish, getting a successfully awakened Mechanical Core is still definitely possible!\"\nDong Muyun didn’t understand Su Ping’s persistence.\nAnd sure enough, Su Ping, holding Feifei’s Mechanical Core, shook his head with a smile and refused:\n\"No need. I didn’t choose Feifei because of a Mechanical Pet Beast’s core, but rather because of Feifei, I want to contract the Mechanical Core.\"\nThese words made Dong Muyun pause.\nThey also made Su Ping pause.\nBecause just as he uttered these words, suddenly, a glow burst forth from the deepest part of his soul’s Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas.\nThen, an Illustrated Handbook that Su Ping had never seen before appeared in his mind.\nIt was an Illustrated Handbook that shone with a golden glow.\nOf course, this golden glow was not of a Legendary Level Illustrated Handbook.\nIt was simply because the Pet Beast on the Illustrated Handbook was golden.\nAt the same time, on the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, the feedback from this unfamiliar Catalog also appeared in Su Ping’s mind:\n[Catalog ’Gold Elemental Elf’ activated, Current Level: 1, Origin Reward Obtained: Elementalization!]",

These beings are born from an Elemental Core and exhibit a wide variety of forms and exceptionally unique growth abilities. However, due to the special nature of the Gold Element, Gold Elemental Cores are relatively easy to find, yet pure elemental elves born from Gold Elemental Cores are extremely rare.\nRacial Potential: Elite Level. Racial Skills: Elemental Body, Jinge Technique, Heart of Gold, etc.]\n[Current Catalog Level: 1 (100/500)]\nKnown Evolutionary Atlas, special Cultivation:\n[Mechanical Awakening: Uses a Gold Elemental Core activated by modern Electromagnetic Force. Data and knowledge are used to forcefully awaken the core’s intelligence. The downside is its inability to form an Elemental Body or corresponding Racial Skills. However, it can instead complete mechanical Cultivation. This is a special Cultivation method with high potential.]\nPreferences, habits:\n[Preferences: Enjoys consuming metal and conducting electricity.]\nRecord Log:\n[Discovered and contacted an awakened Mechanical Core (Gold Elemental Core). Intimacy requirement met. Catalogue Experience +100!]\n[This Mechanical Core is a special Mutant. Each subsequent day spent with it will add +5 Catalogue Experience!]\nAs expected!\nSu Ping nodded. The Pet Beast born from the Mechanical Core couldn’t be considered a new type of Pet Beast.\nInstead, it was a variant of the so-called Gold Elemental Elf, an awakened form achieved through Cultivation.\nHowever, on closer reflection, it did seem to be the case.\nSu Ping often heard about Pet Beasts like Wind Element Spirits, Water Element Elves, and even the relatively rare Thunder Element Elves and Earth Element Elves.\nHe had even just witnessed a Fire Elemental Spirit.\nIndeed, it was Leng Ye’s Blue Flame Heart Demon.\nOf course, that was an Evolutionary Body of a Fire Elemental Spirit.\nBut he had hardly ever heard any mention of the Gold Elemental Elf.\nThe birth of Gold Elemental Elves is extremely rare.\nThe specific reasons for this were also provided in the Catalog.\nGold Element is relatively rare and difficult to condense.\nSo, could Feifei evolve in this direction?\nHowever, Su Ping scratched his head; he was clearly getting ahead of himself.\nBecause damn it, in that annoying, cursed Record Log, he frustratingly found those two words once again:\n’Mutation!’\nSu Ping placed Feifei’s Mechanical Core on the table and then said, \"Feifei, are you there?\"\nHe was quite certain that Feifei had already awakened.\nOtherwise, the Gold Elemental Elf’s entry in the Catalog wouldn’t have lit up after he spoke those words.\nThis undoubtedly meant that Feifei had heard him, which was why its intimacy with him had finally reached the required level.\nSure enough, the Mechanical Core rotated slightly, and then a voice emerged from it, \"Master, I’m here~ Thank you for repairing me, allowing me to see you again, dear Master.\"\nIt was, indeed, Feifei’s voice.\nSu Ping breathed a sigh of relief and then turned his attention to Feifei.\nHe had to see, damn it, how could a Mechanical Core mutate?\nAnd what kind of strange variations could a Mechanical Core even undergo?\nThe Eye of Truth was instantly activated, locking onto Feifei before him.\n[Awakened Mechanical Core (Wild)]\n[Attribute: Psychic]\n[Current Level: Common First Rank]\n[Racial Potential: Common Tenth Level]\n[Skills: Psychic Perception (Proficiency)]\nSu Ping blinked.\nHe was so shocked by this unexpected answer he nearly threw out his back!\nEven if it had mutated, as a mechanical life consciousness awakened from a Gold Elemental Core, shouldn’t it have retained the Metal Element Attribute?\nWhat in the world was this?\nAnd why was it Psychic Element?\nPsychic Element Pet Beasts were reputed to be the hardest type to cultivate. Although quite powerful, they required an extremely large investment.\nStill, a Psychic Element Mechanical Pet Beast? As odd as it sounded, Su Ping had to admit that, aside from his astonishment, he was greatly intrigued.\nA Psychic Element Mechanical Pet Beast?\nSu Ping didn’t know if anyone else had ever heard of such a thing, but he certainly hadn’t.\nMechanical Pet Beasts have many advantages.\nFor instance, it was easier to equip them with single-use Mechanical Weapons, allowing them to engage in battle without consuming their own Energy.\nFurthermore, besides self-circulating Energy absorption and recovery, they could also use batteries or charging to rapidly replenish their power.\nMost also possessed transformative abilities, much like Transformers, offering diverse functions. Yunning, for example, could travel anywhere, whether on land, in the sky, or underwater.\nTheir Cultivation was also more interesting and relatively simpler. One merely needed enough money to replace the materials and components of their mechanical bodies...",

      "content": "Chapter 282: Chapter 167 Feifei’s Attribute!_2\nTherefore, most mechanical Pet Beasts hadn’t experienced much development in their spiritual aspect.\nSu Ping scratched his head as he remembered his conversation with Feifei from the previous day. He gained a deeper understanding of Feifei. Feifei had said that it hurt when it merged with its mechanical body! Clearly, this was an extremely rare occurrence, and a situation that shouldn’t have happened. It was for this reason that Feifei had failed to merge with the mechanical body, transforming into its current form—a mechanical core ball resembling a dinosaur egg, devoid of any combat ability.\nSo, was this why Feifei’s Metal Element was extremely low while its Psychic Element was extremely high?\nHe looked at Feifei spinning in circles on the table and, for the first time, felt utterly stumped. Even Qian Yi hadn’t posed such a challenge for him. Of course, the main issue was Su Ping’s severely lacking research on mechanical types. Suddenly, Su Ping had found a new direction for absorbing knowledge. And admittedly, it wasn’t too late.\nHe still had some distance to cover before reaching the Commander Level. Only after breaking through to the Commander Level could he contract a Third Pet Beast. This was a good opportunity to raise Feifei while studying simultaneously. At this thought, Su Ping relaxed slightly. Indeed, there was no need to rush.\nFor now, Xiao Qing was more important. Su Ping was very satisfied with the results of Qian Yi and Xiao Qing’s actual combat practice the previous night. Qian Yi’s \"Qian Yi Whirlwind\" might have had a lame name, and using it left Qian Yi almost devoid of combat power. However, the skill’s power was undeniable. It could directly spin a Commander Level Steel Arm Ape to death, making it a viable killer move and trump card. Simultaneously, it could also function in area-of-effect combat. This was quite impressive. A Pet Beast capable of fighting beyond its level was truly a protagonist’s standard, so Su Ping was very satisfied.\nXiao Qing, however, had clearly been less impressive in this battle. The significant difference in strength against the opponent was one factor. Furthermore, in terms of abilities, Xiao Qing was certainly inferior to Qian Yi. Of course, their roles were different as well. Xiao Qing was designed for group combat, but Su Ping had been careless and hadn’t brought the Wolf pack into action.\nRegardless, researching Xiao Qing’s evolution path was the most pressing matter for the foreseeable future, aside from cultivating Old Sha’s Heart of Woods. Of course, there was no immediate rush. He was merely planning his focus for the period following Qian Yi’s evolution.\nSo, Su Ping lay on his bed and began to contemplate the other reward he had just acquired. He had lit up a new Talent awarded by the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas. Although most of these Talents had been mediocre previously, and a Beast Tamer couldn’t solely rely on them. For instance, some web novels from his current life depicted characters awakening Mythical Level Talents and becoming invincible—though such stories were indeed rare. Nevertheless, Talents could still play a crucial role in many situations. Any Talent that could be utilized in combat was a good Talent, and Su Ping had finally acquired one. Yes, this time the Talent could actually be useful in combat:\n[Elementalization: A special Beast Tamer Talent. It allows the user to transform their body into an elemental state, greatly increasing speed. Simultaneously, it grants immunity to many special types of damage abilities.]\nIf this Talented Ability could affect Pet Beasts, it would be a game-changing trump card. However, for a Beast Tamer, while still remarkable, it could only be used as a life-saving skill. Su Ping, nonetheless, was already very content with this. For one thing, with this skill, the damage he’d take from Mechanical Weapon explosions would be greatly reduced. After all, an opponent wouldn’t know he possessed this Elementalization ability. Therefore, they wouldn’t prepare Mechanical Weapons capable of harming an elementalized state in advance. This ability could genuinely serve as a life-saving trump card. And admittedly, a Talent that involved transforming one’s own body was quite amazing!\nWith a slight mental prompt from Su Ping, his body instantly became incredibly light. In such a state, his speed would naturally surge. Simultaneously, his body began to turn translucent. He took a pair of crafting scissors and gently pushed them into his body. As expected, they passed right through.\nHowever, as Su Ping watched the scissors pass through his body, a reckless, potentially self-destructive thought surfaced:\nWhat would happen if he deactivated Elementalization while the scissors were still passing through his body?\nSu Ping shuddered and quickly dismissed the thought. Although he possessed a scientific spirit and was interested in studying various skills, it clearly made no sense to be so harsh on himself.\nIf they really got stuck in there, could they even be removed?\nAlthough it was highly probable the scissors would be ejected, there was clearly no need to gamble with his life like that.\nNevertheless, the sensation was truly peculiar. Su Ping felt that maintaining this state required the consumption of spiritual power. However, it was precisely this consumption of spiritual power that allowed him to perceive the more specific details of being elementalized even more clearly. These details gave him a deeper understanding of Elementalization.\nHe had previously thought about trying to evolve the Elf Wolf.",

      "content": "Chapter 283: Chapter 167 Feifei’s Attribute!_3\nNow that Qian Yi’s evolution is complete,\nI can finally free up my hands to tinker with things a bit. The Elf Wolf is one aspect, but the most important is still the Elementalization evolution and Cultivation. I wonder if it’s possible to follow the Elf Wolf’s Cultivation and Evolution methods, as well as those perfected by the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, to bestow the semi-Elementalization abilities and effects of the Elf Wolf upon the rest of the Evolutionary Bodies? As of now, the Elf Wolf hasn’t been bred, but it’s actually me, the Beast Tamer, who has mastered the ability of Elementalization through the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas.\nHowever, it is precisely for this reason that Su Ping has gained a more intuitive understanding of this ability. Some details concerning Elementalization have suddenly become clearer and more profoundly understood.\nUnfortunately, Su Ping exited the state of Elementalization after only five seconds.\nThe consumption of spiritual power is simply too enormous! Even now, having reached Elite Sixth Rank, I cannot maintain the state of Elementalization indefinitely due to such excessive consumption. Clearly, in the end, the Realm of a Beast Tamer is fundamental!\n\"Feifei, you stay here for a while.\"\n\"Okay, Master, rest assured!\"\nMechanical Pet Beasts are great. For one thing, they’re not high-level, but they have high intelligence and can even communicate through speech. Unlike my own two Pet Beasts—one just howls like a wolf, and the other whimpers.\nSu Ping didn’t mention yesterday’s events to Lao Guan and his daughter, nor to Li Shu. He headed straight for the Forest Wolf woods. Sure enough, Li Shu and Guan Lili were feeding tree fruits to the Forest Wolves. Seeing Su Ping approach, Li Shu hurriedly waved at him.\n\"Bro Ping!\"\n\"How have things been recently?\"\n\"Great! After getting used to it, I’ve completely fallen in love with life here! BOO HOO HOO, I love you, Bro Ping!\"\nSu Ping gave the guy a dismissive glance. \"I’m asking how the Forest Wolves are doing.\"\nLi Shu stiffened, scratched his head, and then said, \"Each has made breakthroughs, especially in skill level. Three Forest Wolves have even had their Skills raised to Mastery Level, and there are even more breakthroughs to Proficient Level!\"\nSu Ping’s brow furrowed slightly. \"None have broken through to Perfection Level?\"\n\"That... No...\"\nAfter getting the answer, Su Ping pursed his lips and nodded.\nAs expected, leveling up Skills becomes increasingly difficult the further one progresses. Even though I’ve now broken through to Elite Sixth Rank and can share as many as forty-two Skills, training them to Perfection is still not something that can be accomplished in a short time.\nHowever, if possible, Su Ping still wanted to cultivate Old Sha’s Heart of Woods to Perfection Level before the Cultivation competition began.\nOnly then can I verify what the ultimate result of my Solar Formula truly is. Otherwise, without solid evidence, it won’t be persuasive enough.\nThinking this, Su Ping narrowed his eyes slightly.\nI do have a way to achieve this, but I simply haven’t attempted it before. Now, not only do I have the Heart of Woods, but Pingyun is also here. As for Cultivation funds, I don’t need to worry at all. It’s time to try some methods that don’t care about money.\nHowever, just as Su Ping was about to speak and make arrangements, a dark shadow suddenly flashed across the sky.\nSu Ping instinctively looked up, then his eyes widened and his mouth gaped open again.\nAppearing in the sky was a small, silver-white aircraft.\nI just saw a similar one not long ago, but it was black. And now another one shows up?\nBefore Su Ping could react, and before some of the guests of Heart of Woods and Yun Tian could look up to get a good look at the aircraft, it vanished from the sky as abruptly as it had appeared.\nThen, within Su Ping’s sight, a woman as agile as a cheetah, wearing a tight-fitting combat suit, dropped from the sky.\nDamn, that entrance really is flashy. But no matter how flashy it is, did I really need to see it twice in one day?\nNevertheless, Su Ping could tell that the woman in front of him was also quite special. Moreover, Su Ping could already guess some aspects of her true identity. Previously, he had speculated about Miss Qin’s identity. After this turmoil, he could finally confirm it.\nThat person from the Magic Capital?\nAs soon as this thought emerged, the black-short-haired woman spoke, \"I am looking for Major Su Ping. May I ask...\"\n\"That’s me!\" Su Ping responded. He then thought for a moment and took out the certificate and medal Zhao Deguang had given him last time from his Beast Taming Space.\nThe woman completely ignored Li Shu and Guan Lili beside her, who looked utterly dumbfounded. Li Shu, in particular, looked up again with an exaggerated expression, seemingly trying to gauge the height from which she had descended and how on earth she had managed the jump.\nThe woman said directly, \"Greetings, Major Su Ping. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I was sent by Principal Sang to deliver something to you. Please sign for it!\"\nAs expected.\nSu Ping sighed helplessly. He could guess her intention, but really, it wasn’t necessary.\nI’m not that petty. No matter what, Qin Xiaoxue was kind to me, and Qin Erlong has also been quite considerate. However, when dealing with such a high-level person, I should just take what’s given. She sent someone personally, and in such a manner, leaving no room for refusal.\nSu Ping nodded, took the box that was handed to him, and then said, \"Thank you, and please convey my thanks to Principal Sang as well. I will personally visit Magic Capital after some time to pay her a visit!\"\nThe woman just smiled. Then, perfectly displaying her impetuous nature, she leaped back into the sky. The flying device reappeared out of thin air, and in the next second, it was gone.\nThe entire exchange, from start to finish, lasted no more than two minutes.\nSu Ping, however, ignored the stares of Li Shu and Guan Lili. Holding the box, he returned to his room and opened it.\nTo his slight surprise, a book lay quietly inside the box.\nOn the cover of the book, several words were clearly written: ’Myriad Transformations Meditation Method.’",

      "content": "Chapter 284: Chapter 168: The Grand Fusion of Transformations! Feifei’s Internal Documents\nThe All-Encompassing Meditation Method.\nLooking at the item inside the box, Su Ping felt no particular surprise. It was something he had anticipated, and its appearance seemed perfectly reasonable. Thus, Su Ping felt at ease, sat down, and opened the book.\nWhat appeared before him was an ancient text quoted in relation to this special Meditation Method:\n’When the heart condenses and the form is released, all transformations merge into the dark...’\nThen, after reading for half an hour, Su Ping confirmed that this Meditation Method had absolutely nothing to do with the name from the ancient text. Su Ping had every reason to suspect that this name had been created first, and then someone had simply picked a pleasant-sounding name from ancient writings to attach to it.\nHowever, it had to be said that despite the unrelated name, the content within was enough for Su Ping to overlook this minor flaw.\nSu Ping finally understood the origin of Meditation Methods. Before actually seeing this, Su Ping had never explored research in this direction.\nNow that he considered it, within the Beast Tamer Civilization, although recorded history didn’t span ten thousand years, an endless stream of talented individuals had still emerged.\nAnd this direction was the Soul Contract!\nIn this All-Encompassing Meditation Method, humans were also considered a type of ’Pet Beast.’ They were special ’Pet Beasts’ primarily of the ’Psychic’ element, with the ’Space Element’ as a supplement.\nHowever, humans, as this type of ’Pet Beast,’ could not autonomously possess power, nor could they change form through Evolution. Even acquiring a Soul Contract and a Beast Taming Space required the aid of an ’Awakening Stone.’\nBut, every loss has its gain. Meditation allowed humans to achieve virtually limitless growth through self-cultivation. The Soul Contract, moreover, was a unique Ability of human Beast Tamers.\nThe Meditation Method was a technique for achieving meditative resonance with Pet Beasts bound by a Soul Contract. Through this resonance, one’s spiritual power would become familiar with this type of force.\nOnce a minor level of proficiency was achieved, Pet Beast assistance was no longer required, and one could meditate alone. During such meditation, effects and manifestations differing from normal meditation would occur.\nIt sounded easy, but it was extremely difficult in practice.\nTherefore, Su Ping didn’t overthink it. Instead, he chose to try it directly!\nWhat were the benefits of practicing this Meditation Method? Qin Xiaoxue had previously spoken of it somewhat vaguely. Su Ping hadn’t paid much mind then, but now it seemed that practicing this Meditation Method offered far too many advantages compared to simple meditation.\nTake this All-Encompassing Meditation Method, for instance. It was a Meditation Method that resonated with Wood Element and Undead Pet Beasts.\nFirstly, the speed of meditation would definitely increase slightly; this was without a doubt.\nSecondly, through Soul Resonance, one’s spiritual power could simulate some Wood Element and Necromancy Series energies. Of course, the effect would definitely not be as potent as that of one’s own Pet Beasts. However, it could still alter the spiritual power’s effect, preventing it from being merely a hindrance or a prime target on the battlefield.\nThese two functions were the main effects of this All-Encompassing Meditation Method!\nBesides these, there were also some secondary effects. For example, the one Su Ping valued most was the ability to maintain some meditative effects even during sleep. And there were many more.\nNo doubt about it. When Qin Xiaoxue had spoken of it previously, even with her status as Miss Qin, she had been so cautious about this Meditation Method; indeed, there was a reason for that.\nThe preciousness of this item was hard to imagine!\nLeaping across this world’s social strata wasn’t something achievable merely by encountering a talented Pet Beast or having a decent stroke of luck. Any little boost, accumulated over countless years, would result in a vast difference.\nSu Ping now somewhat understood how the Beast Taming Gate Families, which had existed for thousands, or perhaps several thousand years, had passed down their legacies. The Meditation Method definitely played a significant role in this heritage.\nAnd anyone capable of creating any Meditation Method was certainly no ordinary person.\nAs for whether this All-Encompassing Meditation Method was created by Lord Sang Sheng, Su Ping didn’t know.\nHis eyes were already closed.\nInside the Beast Taming Space, the Little Paper Figure, which until yesterday hadn’t left the space, seemed to sense something. While Xiao Qing was leisurely basking in the sun above, the Little Paper Figure suddenly let out a WAH!\nXiao Qing looked at the creature discontentedly.\nThis fellow that’s always muttering and drawing its sword, what’s it up to now?\nDamn, it’s so annoying! But I can’t beat it!\nBut soon, Xiao Qing also sensed something. Its two ears perked up straight.\nThey sensed that their master’s spirit seemed to connect with them. This feeling was extremely special. It was as if their master’s palms were simultaneously caressing their bodies.\nAt the same time, their faint spiritual connection seemed to link with their master through the Soul Contract.\nThen, the next second, the connection broke.\nSu Ping opened his eyes. He had failed.\nBut Su Ping wasn’t discouraged. He continued to attempt.\nInside the Beast Taming Space, the two little creatures immediately drooped. The Little Paper Figure continued to draw its Thunder Sword, practicing within its small, designated territory. Then suddenly, it let out another WAH!\nXiao Qing did the same; its ears had just drooped but then shot straight up again.\nFive seconds later, the two little creatures returned to normal. And then it started again...\nThis process repeated over and over, lasting for more than half an hour. It happened every ten seconds, making the two little creatures in the Beast Taming Space somewhat psychically hypersensitive. They always felt that in the next second, their master was about to initiate Soul Resonance with them via the Soul Contract. Yet, this resonance, no matter what, just couldn’t establish a complete connection.\nFinally, this resonance, which had nearly induced a stress response in the two little creatures, stopped. It gave the two little creatures a short respite!\n「In reality.」\nSitting in the study, Su Ping at this moment had fallen into self-doubt.\nDid Lord Sang Sheng know that practicing this Meditation Method was so difficult?\nOver half an hour! Although this duration wasn’t excessive, for meditation, it wasn’t a significant amount of time. But the problem was, during this entire half-hour, he had been constantly trying to resonate with Xiao Qing and Qian Yi, attempting to practice the Meditation Method. Yet, in all this half-hour, not once did the resonance last more than five seconds!\nMoreover, most of the time, the attempts weren’t even as effective as the first successful resonance!\nWhat the hell is this?\nSu Ping scratched his head. He didn’t try again. Throughout this half-hour, he had already tried countless times, refusing to give up. However, forget about completing the resonance and beginning meditation together; he couldn’t even maintain the resonance for a longer duration.\nTherefore, Su Ping sat on the chair, his face etched with existential doubt, murmuring in shock,\nCould it be that I have no Talent for cultivation?\nNo Talent!\nThis term, Su Ping had never before imagined it could be applied to himself. His Talent, not to mention in breeding research, was quite remarkable even in meditation. At No. 6 Middle School, his meditation score was the best in the school. And now, with this Meditation Method, Su Ping couldn’t even reach the beginner level in half an hour.\nIs it my problem?\nSu Ping found it somewhat inconceivable.\n\"Master, you’re the best! Don’t be discouraged!\"\nJust then, Feifei, on the desk, uttered consoling words. It provided a tiny bit of comfort to Su Ping, who was mired in self-doubt. But of course, it was just that—a tiny bit.\nIf it wasn’t a problem with my own Talent, then what was the reason?\nWas it because these two Pet Beasts, strictly speaking, couldn’t be considered pure Wood Element or Undead Pet Beasts?\nSeriously, that’s a real possibility.\nThese two mutated little ones, no one could say they were like normal Pet Beasts.\nDamn it!\nMutated Pet Beasts are my downfall!\nFrustration bubbled within Su Ping!\nAfter this contract with Feifei is complete, if I continue to advance, my fourth Pet Beast must absolutely not be another Mutated Pet Beast!\nThis is such a pain!\nYes, the fault lies with the Pet Beasts!\nIt’s definitely not an issue with his, Su the Great Genius’s, Talent.\nSu Ping was certain.\nSo, he decided to stop agonizing over this Meditation Method.\nSo what if it just increases meditation speed a little?\nSo what if it just improves meditation efficiency a bit?\nSo what if it just allows one’s spiritual power to undergo some Energy changes?\nWhat’s so great about that?\nHe, Su the Great Genius, doesn’t need it! Maybe I can even create my own Meditation Method in the future!\n\"Mhm!\" Su Ping nodded, already fantasizing how future biographers might write about him:\n’The great Breeder and Beast Tamer, Master X (X the Legend), possessing unparalleled Talent, adapted a Meditation Method to his own Pet Beasts, astonishing the world...’\nWith this thought, Su Ping’s mood improved significantly. Clearly, this self-deception was working wonders.\nAnd so, Su Ping stepped out of his study once again.\nMeditation Methods and whatnot, best not to mention them for now, nor practice them!\nComparatively, Pet Beast cultivation was more of a concern for him.\nNew Year’s Day was just over a month away. And on New Year’s Day, the Breeder Competition would begin in Magic Capital. At the Breeder Competition, he had to earn some face for Jianghai and for Old Liu. It was also the time to officially start building his reputation and winning awards.\nTherefore, Old Sha’s cultivation was even more important now. Unfortunately, the Heart of Woods’ skill level still hadn’t improved. Su Ping also needed to devise some special tactics.\nHe hadn’t tried them before. This was partly because he didn’t know if they would be effective, and partly because it was too troublesome. But now, he had to make time to try.\nIf I continue to feed it the Heart of Woods Magic Potion, will there be an improvement?\nFurthermore, if I use relatively Advanced Level materials and resources to enhance the Heart of Woods Magic Potion’s effects, could it accelerate the skill level improvement of Heart of Woods?\nAfter a brief planning session, Su Ping headed to the laboratory area.\nHowever, what Su Ping absolutely hadn’t anticipated was that just as he left the study, Feifei, on the desk, rotated its body slightly, swaying.\nThen, a very faint spiritual power spread out. Feifei’s only innate Skill, ’Psychic Perception,’ allowed it to ’look’ at The All-Encompassing Meditation Method book Su Ping had tossed onto the desk.\nIt wanted to help its master!\nLet’s see if there’s any way to help Master compensate for his ’lack of Talent.’\nMhm!\nRUSTLE, RUSTLE. The pages of the book flipped from beginning to end.\nAfter scanning all the content of The All-Encompassing Meditation Method, Feifei ’nodded,’ then secretly created a hidden file in its Mechanical Core. The file was named:\n\"About the Inability of the Master to Practice the Meditation Method Due to Lack of Talent...\"",

The Secret Realm Distribution Map of Qintian Monitor!\n\"Got one, got one!\"\nAt the rear of the Heart of Woods Pet Beast Comprehensive Cultivation Base, adjacent to the Lingxi River, an area was now connected to the river, forming a large lake approximately twenty miles in diameter.\nThe large lake was connected to the Lingxi River, which flowed through it. On the lake’s surface, besides a large bridge linking to the Lingxi River, there were also two pavilions in the lake’s center and several walkways built with special structures. These allowed people to walk freely over the surface of the Heart of Water Lake on either side.\nIt was also possible to fish and enjoy the scenery.\nIndeed, that was what was happening right now.\nOn this fishing platform, many excited anglers standing behind a lone figure shouted out.\nSeated in a pavilion in the lake’s center, Su Ping fiercely lifted his specially made mechanical fishing rod.\nIn the next moment, amid the exclamations of the onlookers, a big fish over a meter long was hoisted straight up by him!\nInstantly, some of the nearby anglers let out bursts of amazement:\n\"An Elite Level red-spotted silver carp! What a fine Pet Beast indeed! And the red-spotted scales it produces are quite pricey Water Element materials.\"\n\"Sure enough, the ads didn’t lie; you really can catch Pet Beasts here!\"\n\"Heh, this isn’t a place just anyone can afford. This is the best spot on Heart of Water Lake. Just to fish here for an hour, not to mention additional expenses, costs a whopping fifty thousand yuan!\"\n\"Fifty thousand for just an hour of fishing? Even if you don’t catch anything?\"\nA bystander exclaimed, obviously stunned by the high cost.\nImmediately, some people looked at the one who had exclaimed with disdain, with one person showing off, \"Fifty thousand is expensive? Let me tell you straight, that’s just the base price! To fish here, you have to purchase the accompanying services! A single piece of bait costs ten to twenty thousand! Want to use their fishing rods? Renting one also costs money!\"\nClearly, some people had been there for quite a while and knew a great deal about the place.\n\"What bait? So expensive, just for one piece? If you don’t catch anything, isn’t that a huge loss?\"\nSomeone was perplexed.\nIndeed, such terrifying expenses for a fishing venue left many in disbelief.\nYet some responded with disdain, \"Bait made by blending Water Spirit Grass with the flesh of Water Element Pet Beasts—do you think it’s worth the price or not!?\"\n\"Ah? Using such things for bait? What are you trying to catch, a Dragon?\"\nSome people were puzzled, while others continued to show off their knowledge with pride.\n\"The most important thing is, even if you do manage to catch a fish, you have to pay two more fees!\"\n\"Ah? Pay two more fees? I’ve heard that if you catch a fish here and want to take it with you, you must pay a fee based on the value of the fish. Is there another expense?\"\n\"Of course, there is. If you catch an Elite Level mature Pet Beast, or even a Commander Level one, do you think you can handle or even kill it on your own?\"\nWith that said, the novice seemed to understand something and nodded before widening his eyes in shock. \"You can catch Commander Level Pet Beasts here? How is that possible?\"\nSomeone responded with disdain, \"How is it not possible? Two days ago, I saw with my own eyes someone catch a Purple Thunder Eel! Even with the mechanical fishing rod reducing its strength right away, that lightning was terrifying. It was the staff member, who, after receiving the order from the angler to kill the fish, used a mechanical energy gun to finally put it down.\"\n\"Purple Thunder Eel? Damn!\"\nThe person was clearly no longer contemplating why a Pet Beast service base in the suburbs had access to Mechanical Weapons.\nAfter all, it was well-known that this Pet Beast base had connections that reached the heavens.\n\"So, if you land that kind of catch, and you can take it away or kill it on the spot without needing the staff here to use their Low-level Mechanical Weapons, such as guns and crossbows, then naturally you don’t have to spend that money.\"\n\"Heh, as if it’s that easy to catch. If you do hook one of those, you’d have to fish even if it meant taking out a loan. Catching one is a hugely profitable venture, no losses. The Thunder Gland of a Purple Thunder Eel is a high-grade resource, even among Commander Level ones!\"\nSome shook their heads, while others, confident in their fishing skills, were excited to try their luck.\nSome were resigned, steering clear of this fishing activity that was akin to gambling. \"Forget it, it’s too expensive here. Over by the outer perimeter of the Heart of Water Lake, it’s only a thousand yuan for an hour of fishing. It’s not far from here, so it should be about the same, right?\"\n\"Indeed, this place isn’t for people like us.\"\n\"Do you know why this place became so popular across Linzhou in such a short amount of time? Do you know who comes here to fish?\"\n\"See that person over there? That’s the old manager of Linzhou’s White Wind Snow Wolf Cultivation Base, Old Zhao, the Intermediate Level Breeder from the Jianghai Breeder Association!\"\n\"And that one over there, they say he’s a director of the Fire King Company...\"\n\"And that one...\"\n\"And that one...\"\nSomeone spoke quietly, their words all pointing to one fact:\n’This place really doesn’t lack for customers!’\nEspecially those willing to spend money on fishing!\nIn Linzhou, where else could you find a fishing ground where you might catch Commander Level, or even Advanced Commander Level Pet Beasts?",

For some, the money spent wasn’t even a concern. Besides, sometimes, if luck was on your side, what you caught wouldn’t just save you from losing money; you could even profit!\nWhat kind of concept was that?\nWealthy people aren’t fools. If it were just a scam to take their money, so many wouldn’t spend the entire day here. Some even combined their visit with a stay at the resort complex out front and decided not to leave at all.\nIt was precisely this kind of engaging entertainment, with excellent service and experiences worth bragging about, that drew people in. It wasn’t simply about scamming money; if you were lucky or skilled, you could even make money, and it was damn exciting. Such leisure spots were what truly attracted people.\nThat was why the Heart of Water at the Heart of Woods Pet Beast Service Base had become so bustling in just a few days since its official completion.\n\"Nice one, Little Su! You’re quite lucky today!\" someone nearby called out.\nIt was none other than Old Zhao, fishing on the platform closest to Su Ping.\n\"Haha, Old Zhao, you’d better step it up! Otherwise, I might win the price of a Snow Wolf from you today!\"\n\"Hey, you little rascal! So that’s why you insisted on betting with me this morning! You had this planned all along, eh? Just you watch what Old Zhao can do!\"\nUnfortunately, Old Zhao’s luck clearly wasn’t very good. All morning, apart from catching an Ordinary Level Black Whisker Grass Carp, he hadn’t made any other notable catches.\nSu Ping didn’t mind. He smiled faintly and flicked his fishing rod. \"Xiao Qing!\"\nXiao Qing let out a howl! It suddenly leaped from behind Su Ping and, in one bite, snatched the exhausted Red-Spotted Silver Carp being dragged by the mechanical fishing rod. Then, without waiting for Su Ping’s command, it bit the fish to death and took a large, satisfying bite, as if to show it off.\nThe onlookers couldn’t help but feel a pang of pity; after all, it was too extravagant.\nFeeding Elite Level fish meat so casually to Pet Beasts?\nSu Ping, however, obviously didn’t care much. The value of forming a Soul Contract with these mature, wild Pet Beasts wasn’t significant. Moreover, without a contract, their wildness was extreme.\nIt’s important to understand that in the classification by Beast Tamers, such Pet Beasts found in the wild weren’t truly considered Pet Beasts. In the Legion, these highly aggressive Pet Beasts were referred to as Ferocious Beasts. The materials from these Ferocious Beasts, even their flesh, were quite valuable resources. This was also why, at the Heart of Water fishing grounds, some powerful staff members were extremely well-prepared with Mechanical Weapons. Because in this world of Beast Tamers, fishing—especially wild fishing of this nature—could be called an ’extreme sport’! After all, who the hell knew what kind of creature might leap out from beneath the fishing rod.\nMeanwhile, Su Ping also found some satisfaction in this.\nServes them right!\nFreaking fish.\nSu Ping now understood which type of Pet Beast was the hardest to build a bond with.\nThat’s right—these aquatic creatures, like fish and shrimp.\nTheir seven-second memory was truly no exaggeration.\nPreviously, he had fished and casually raised some, hoping to reach the required intimacy level to activate the Catalog of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas. Although he didn’t plan on cultivating them, activating the Catalog would grant additional Beast Tamer Talents through the Origin feedback from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas. No one would complain about having too many Abilities, even though many Talents were actually quite useless.\nIt was just too bad that after all this time, he’d gotten nothing for his efforts. Instead, it had caused him a lot of trouble. Whenever he got slightly close, these ungrateful fish he’d raised for days would try to bite him or use their Skills, leading Su Ping to suffer some minor injuries over the past couple of days. In the end, all these various fish, which hadn’t warmed up to him despite being raised for so long, were given to his employees as extra meals.\nPeople are so much better,\nhe thought.\nEven an extra meal can build camaraderie, unlike with fish.\nThe uniqueness of the Heart of Water was naturally due to the Rainbow Coral Worms underwater. The Water Element Barrier sent by the Tianyun Group had been set up underwater, protecting the Rainbow Coral Worms yet still managing to attract countless aquatic Pet Beasts. The Lingxi River, being close to West Dragon Lake, saw large numbers of wild aquatic Pet Beasts coming and going, making it a perfect, natural hunting ground for them!\nAlthough, in Dong Muyun’s view, using Rainbow Coral Worms—such a precious resource Pet Beast—for such a seemingly trivial business was like using a butcher’s cleaver to kill a chicken: complete overkill and a waste.\nSu Ping, however, didn’t mind.\nThis kind of thing was truly comfortable.\nBy creating such an excellent fishing spot here, even the Advanced Level individuals around Linzhou who enjoyed fishing would have to thank him.\nOf course, when the place first opened, it attracted some unsavory types. However, there was no need for words; after a few discreet inquiries about the situation, no one dared to cause any trouble.\nA joke! The collaborator of Queen Dong of Linzhou, with partnerships with the Legion and various associations, and a young Intermediate Breeder highly valued by two chairmen—such connections truly made him untouchable in Linzhou.\nDuring this period, aside from the Meditation Method and the rather troublesome matter of raising fish, everything else left Su Ping quite satisfied. Especially Old Sha’s Cultivation. Although bringing the Heart of Woods to Perfection Level still seemed a ways off, Su Ping’s guess had indeed been correct.",

Secret Realm Distribution Map of Qintian Monitor!_3\nThe Heart of Woods Magic Potion still had room for development.\nReplacing it with a similarly medicinal, yet more potent and powerful resource material could indeed accelerate Old Sha’s progress with the Heart of Woods.\nIt had even raised Old Sha’s Level by one.\nTwo days ago, he had reached the Commander Tenth Rank.\nHe was just a single step away from reaching the Monarch Level.\nOnce he had a Monarch Level Pet Beast to secure his position, he would truly have something to rely on.\nThis left Su Ping extremely satisfied, and his heart surged with anticipation.\nOnly now did he realize just how precious and rare Old Sha’s Solar Formula truly was, and what it meant to produce a Super-Rank Skill through such a method.\nSu Ping treasured this opportunity all the more and eagerly awaited the day the Solar Formula would undergo a qualitative transformation.\nMoreover, Xiao Qing’s evolution path and the Elf Wolf’s cultivation were proceeding smoothly, so Su Ping didn’t need to rush.\n\"HAHA, got a bite!\"\nA surprised voice broke Su Ping’s contemplation.\nLao Zhao’s voice, full of delight, came from not too far away.\nIndeed, something special was dangling from the fishing rod. Its head sported two horns, but its body was quite bulky, and its front had a spike-like form. If not for these features, it might have somewhat resembled a flood dragon.\nIt was an Elite Peak Pet Beast: the Twin-horned Spearfish.\nIts flesh was delicious, and its two horns were an especially rare resource.\nLao Zhao’s face flushed with excitement. For him, a mere Elite Peak Level fish wasn’t much. But that was clearly the joy of fishing.\nThe evolved Snow Wolf beside him, unlike Xiao Qing, simply blew a breath, instantly freezing the Twin-horned Spearfish solid.\nThen, as if Lao Zhao had been prepared all along, he waved someone over. A waiter promptly brought a dish of dipping sauce.\nLao Zhao immediately had it sliced into sashimi and began to savor it with relish.\nSu Ping found the scene rather comical.\nHowever, rumor had it that this Twin-horned Spearfish tasted quite good, didn’t it?\nLao Zhao, clearly being generous, called out, \"Come on, Su, try some!\"\nSu Ping didn’t stand on ceremony. He put down his fishing rod, quickly walked over, and picked up a piece of the flash-frozen tuna that had already been sliced. He dipped it into the sauce—a mix of wasabi, soy sauce, and lemon juice—and swallowed it.\nThe initial spiciness gave way to the fresh, tender taste of the fish, complemented by an amazingly chewy texture and a subtle fragrance. It was truly a delightful surprise for Su Ping.\nMost importantly, after he swallowed, it seemed to transform into a faint coolness that coursed through his body, feeling incredibly comfortable.\n\"HAHAHAHA, how’s the taste? You little rascal, you’re either meditating or researching Pet Beast cultivation every day. When you have time, you need to learn to enjoy life too!\" Lao Zhao said with a smile.\nSu Ping didn’t hold back. He picked up two more slices; one he put into his own mouth, and the other he tossed to Xiao Qing, who was watching eagerly.\nOnce Xiao Qing caught it in her mouth, she let out an AWOO.\nClearly, the taste of the wasabi was too much for the little one.\n\"HAHAHA.\" Su Ping laughed heartily, picked up another piece, and said, \"Lao Zhao, this fish is my treat. Please put it on my tab with the staff.\"\nThe nearby waiter nodded in acknowledgment.\nLao Zhao wasn’t bothered. For the two of them, such a small matter wasn’t worth mentioning.\nUnfortunately, just as Su Ping was about to continue savoring the rare delicacy, his phone suddenly chimed.\nIt wasn’t a call, just a message notification.\nHowever, the sender was rather special, compelling Su Ping to check it immediately.\nThat’s right, the sender was none other than Leng Ye, who had departed that day and had been silent for the past few days!\nWhen Su Ping saw the sender’s name, his heart skipped a beat, and he eagerly looked at the message on his phone.\nSure enough, the content of the message made Su Ping’s eyes light up!\n[Leng Ye: Kid, I’ve sorted out that business of yours. Your certificate should arrive in a couple of days. From today on, you’re officially a ’Special Secret Realm Inspector,’ registered with the Dragon Nation’s special department, the Qintian Monitor.]\nA Special Secret Realm Inspector?\nSu Ping scratched his head.\nThe title and position sound a bit odd. And it’s under the Qintian Monitor?\nHe continued to read:\n[Leng Ye: From now on, you have the right to enter all Secret Realms for inspection. Also, Qintian Monitor inspectors have no authority to command or deploy you! However, as a trade-off, you are not eligible for some of the Qintian Monitor’s internal resource exchanges.]\n[Su Ping: Deal!]\nHe currently had access to internal resources from the Breeder Association and the Legion. What did he need the Qintian Monitor’s resources for? Unnecessary. For Su Ping, the most important thing was the Secret Realm itself!\nAt this thought, Su Ping’s eyes lit up. Just then, Leng Ye sent another message:\n[Leng Ye: The Qintian Monitor’s internal network has information on all discovered Secret Realms across the country, which you can browse at will. Kid, I don’t know what you’re up to, but remember this: those Secret Realms that are being properly managed by various regions for sustainable use—you absolutely cannot mess them up! If you cause any trouble, even if I can cover for you, the consequences will be severe. So, if you want something, just tell me. The Heavenly Tomb Sword Seal’s value isn’t limited to just this. If you need any other help, speak up early.]",

And incredibly effective!\nEven without thinking too hard, he knew obtaining such access privileges to a special department like this was an exceedingly difficult task. Although he couldn’t enjoy the resources, having this right and the internal information resources of the Qintian Monitor was the biggest gain.\nAfter Su Ping sent a message back, he switched on his phone, no longer caring about the fishing rod. From the message Leng Ye had sent, he accessed the Qintian Monitor’s internal network. Then, after entering his ID number and confirming his pupil through the phone’s camera, he fulfilled the entry requirements.\nAs expected, the most conspicuous option within this internal network was \"Current Secret Realms.\"\nAfter Su Ping clicked it, a huge 3D virtual map of Dragon Nation appeared on his phone screen. With a slight move of his finger, sure enough, the map displayed the number of Secret Realms that had been discovered across Dragon Nation.\nHowever, Su Ping soon noticed something different. Within this internal information from the Qintian Monitor, besides showing the number of Secret Realms in each province, there was also a classification of Secret Realm levels on the side!\nThis was beyond Su Ping’s expectations. After all, the only Secret Realm he had encountered was that of the Fengdu Sword King.\nWithin the internal network of the Qintian Monitor, Secret Realms were classified into four levels—Heaven, Earth, Profound, and Yellow—based on important criteria such as the realm’s spatial size, danger level, resource output, and the level of its former owner. Also, among the discovered and developed Secret Realms, they were differentiated as either recyclable or non-recyclable. The classification of Secret Realms was extremely meticulous.\nIndeed! Professional work should be left to professionals. And the work of the Qintian Monitor—that’s what you call professional!\nAfter a brief moment of contemplation, Su Ping clicked on the Secret Realms in Jianghai Province.\nTo his surprise, there were quite a number of Secret Realms scattered throughout Jianghai Province. He saw over twenty in total! To his further surprise, two of them were marked as recyclable, with one reaching Profound Level and the other even Earth Level.\nHe clicked to check. The Profound Level one, he now saw, was located in a place he was very familiar with: within the Breeder Association.\nHow had he never noticed before that the Breeder Association housed such a treasure? But Su Ping also knew that information about such places wouldn’t be casually disclosed; once discovered, they were properly guarded and managed.\nAs for the Earth Level recyclable Secret Realm in Jianghai, when Su Ping clicked to check, he received a notification:\n[Respected Inspector Su Ping, you do not have the authority to view specific information about this level of Secret Realm.]\nAlright then. Su Ping understood that Secret Realms of this level were immensely valuable and significant, not just for a province but for Dragon Nation as a whole. Besides, his target wasn’t these precious, resource-producing recyclable Secret Realms anyway. He was after the depleted, desolate Secret Realms!\nWith this in mind, Su Ping started to examine them one by one.\nJianghai Province was already quite large. The Secret Realms were located everywhere—some in other cities far from Linzhou, and some even in desolate wastelands.\nHow on earth did the people from the Qintian Monitor find these Secret Realms hidden in the most obscure corners and record them?\nSu Ping didn’t concern himself with these issues, looking through each one:\n[Jianghai Secret Realm 1014 - Non-renewable (Yellow Level)]\n[Details: Located at the abandoned Hongwei Steam Factory in the suburbs of Shuiyuan City, Jianghai Province. Discovered: January 25, New Calendar Year 223. Identified as the remnant Secret Realm of Yu Yu, the ’Wrathful Sea King’ from the late Liang Dynasty (approx. 300 years ago). Type: Ordinary Secret Realm. Estimated natural dissipation: 14 months. Resources produced: ...]\nShuiyuan City? It seems to be north of Linzhou City, a port city near the Eastern Sea. It’s famous for its abundance of aquatic Pet Beasts. I didn’t expect there to be one there.\nThinking of this, Su Ping felt a surge of urgency.\nDiscovered in January, and it was already almost November. In just four more months, according to the Qintian Monitor’s prediction, it would completely dissipate. Wouldn’t I lose my chance to fleece it then? And this was just one such case.\nSuddenly, Su Ping no longer felt like fishing.\nA quick look showed that time waits for no one! He could only watch helplessly as Secret Realms in other provinces naturally dissipated; there was nothing he could do about those. But he couldn’t let the ones in Jianghai Province slip away during this period!\nHe looked at the Secret Realms in Jianghai Province with furrowed brows and a grave expression. Clearly, apart from those two that could be recycled, the rest were all on the verge of dissipation within this period.\nThe number of Secret Realms didn’t actually surprise Su Ping. It was true that only deceased Emperor-level Beastmasters could generate Secret Realms. Emperor-level Beastmasters were indeed quite rare. But it depended on the perspective. Consider the historical timeline as the X-axis and the geographical area where Beastmasters from Dragon Nation—and even surrounding regions who came to Dragon Nation—died as the Y-axis. Then, even within a single century, the number of Emperor-level Beastmasters who emerged would definitely not be small!\nTherefore, the number of Secret Realms didn’t surprise Su Ping.\nAfter quickly reviewing all the Secret Realm information, Su Ping let out a long breath.\nAmong the twenty-plus Secret Realms, what Su Ping hadn’t expected at all was that quite a few were within Linzhou City’s vicinity—a full six of them! And that was excluding the recyclable Secret Realm. But that made sense. The condition for a Secret Realm’s emergence was the location where a Beastmaster had died in the past. In ancient times, Linzhou was a major city in the eastern region. At one point, it was even more prosperous than the Magic Capital. So, it was perfectly normal for there to be so many remnant Secret Realms.\nAnd soon enough, Su Ping had locked on to one of those targets.\nIt wasn’t because this particular Secret Realm was predicted by the Qintian Monitor to dissipate soon; the few Secret Realms in Linzhou City still had several months, or even more than half a year, remaining.\nSo, time-wise, there was still a comfortable margin. The reason he locked onto this one was purely because it was very, very close. So close, it was almost unbelievable.\n[Jianghai Secret Realm 972 - Non-renewable (Yellow Level)]\n[Details: Located in the wilderness 10 kilometers north of the Lingxi River station, outskirts of Linzhou City, Jianghai Province. Discovered: April 11, New Calendar Year 222. Identified as the remnant Secret Realm of Niu Ba, the ’Shaking Forest Pig King’ from the mid-Liang Dynasty (approx. 500 years ago). Type: Ordinary Secret Realm. Estimated natural dissipation: 22 months. Resources produced: ...]\nThat’s right, in the wilderness forest 10 kilometers north of the Lingxi River station, on the outskirts of Linzhou City.\nHis own place was the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base near the Lingxi River station. His Heart of Wood Cultivation Base grounds even encompassed a stretch of the Lingxi River. And its location was south of the Lingxi River station. South of the main road, to be precise. This remnant Secret Realm of the so-called ’Shaking Forest Pig King’ Niu Ba was practically just across the road from his base, in the undeveloped wilderness to the north. The kind one could find by venturing about ten kilometers into that wilderness. In other words, Su Ping could probably ride Old Sha across the road and find it in less than five minutes.\nThinking of this, Su Ping felt a surge of excitement!\nI’ll go check it out!",

Damn Tomb Raiders!\n\"I have to say, you in that outfit really do look like one of those ancient generals, all valiant and ready for war!\"\nBeside him, Dong Muyun observed Su Ping.\nMounted on ’War Wolf Old Sha,’ Su Ping wore what could only be described as luxurious soft Scale Armor, crafted from the scales of Ironrock Giant Lizards. He even had a mechanical firearm holstered at his waist.\nThe Beast Master Association of Jianghai had authorized him to use Mechanical Weapons after the last assassination attempt on him.\nBehind Su Ping was a dense pack of wolves, thirty or forty strong.\nA pack of this size would likely cause an unimaginable disturbance if it appeared on the streets, especially in a bustling district. Fortunately, they were in the suburbs, specifically within his own Pet Beast base.\nSu Ping snorted. \"What do you mean, ’look like’? I *am* going to battle!\"\nDong Muyun curled her lips. \"It’s the first time I’ve heard of an ancient general going to war with divine weapons, leading thousands to plunder an empty mountain stronghold with no enemies left, and even taking along Advanced Level bodyguard Battle Pets!\"\nOf course, that was just talk. Even if Su Ping hadn’t mentioned it, Dong Muyun would have insisted on accompanying him once she knew his intentions. The Secret Realm was, after all, far too dangerous.\nSu Ping seemingly missed the mockery in her words. Instead, he looked at her with some surprise. \"You consider yourself an Advanced Level bodyguard Battle Pet? Alright then, call me ’Master’ and let’s hear it!\"\nDong Muyun glared, her hand sheathed in Yunning. The energy cannon on her arm seemed ready to fire at Su Ping.\nJust then, Yunning’s voice interjected, \"Master, Mister Su Ping is your partner, and his status is special. Unless there is a life-threatening situation, it is not advisable to engage Mister Su Ping!\"\n\"HAHAHA!\" Su Ping laughed. \"See? Even Yunning doesn’t agree.\"\nDong Muyun’s face darkened. Yunning’s faceplate immediately deployed, and then Dong Muyun snapped, \"Cut the crap! I’m really pressed for time. I don’t have all day to waste on your fruitless ventures!\"\nSu Ping looked skeptically at the woman.\nWhat’s with her? She’s acting as if she has a short fuse.\nBut seeing she wasn’t in the best of moods, Su Ping didn’t continue to tease her. Looking at the wolves waiting patiently behind him, he addressed them like an officer rallying his troops, \"Boys, are you ready!?\"\n\"AWOO!\"\nIn front of the Heart of Woods base, a chorus of wolf howls rose in unison.\nSu Ping nodded in satisfaction. He recalled all the Forest Wolves into his Beast Taming Space, then grabbed the branch-like antler on Old Sha’s head, looking towards the distance with excitement. \"Old Sha, let’s roll out!\"\n\"AWOO!\"\nOld Sha seemed to snap to attention, like a soldier beginning his march, and strode out of the Heart of Woods gates with a bold and impressive air.\nSeeing Su Ping’s show of bravado, Dong Muyun was amused despite herself, then shook her head helplessly.\nHonestly, only this guy could drag me out for something so trivial,\nshe thought.\nThis is probably just going to be an outing, and he needs me, a Monarch Level Beastmaster, to act as his guard and bodyguard? Does this guy really think I have nothing better to do than to hang around with him all day?\nOf course, Dong Muyun’s foul mood wasn’t really because of this. It was purely due to a phone call that morning.\nIt wasn’t from just anyone; it was from her esteemed father.\nIn truth, the father and daughter had spoken a few times before. Previously, however, Dong Muyun’s attitude had been relatively indifferent, especially since Dong Mutian had been rather quiet lately.\nHowever, the situation had apparently changed. She had learned that Dachuan Company, their competitor against Tianyun Real Estate, had been acquired by Pingyun Company—the venture she co-founded with Su Ping—for an unbelievably low price.\nThis news had undoubtedly reached the Dong Family.\nWhile it would be extremely difficult for outsiders to glean the finer details, it posed no challenge for the Dong Family. They naturally knew that a very important figure had visited Linzhou that night.\nSo, the increasing frequency of her father’s calls over the past few days had given Dong Muyun an inkling of what was to come.\nAnd that morning, he had outright asked a question he had never dared to broach before.\nHer father, the patriarch of the esteemed Mirror Saint Dong Family lineage, actually wanted to use his daughter’s connection to meet Su Ping, a junior.\nThe implications were self-evident.\nDong Muyun’s gaze turned indifferent.\nSu Ping is ’mine,’\nshe mused.\nHe’s my best chance to shed the Dong Family label. A prominent family provides an excellent platform and background, but in this era, it’s also a shackle. This is my best opportunity. I can’t let the people around Su Ping, or those supporting him, think he’s connected to me only because of some tie to the Dong Family.\nSo, almost without a second thought, Dong Muyun had bluntly rejected her father’s proposal.\nBut I wonder what this kid thinks about it?\nShe glanced ahead at Su Ping, who was swaggering proudly on Old Sha as he crossed the road, heading purposefully towards the wasteland north of it.\nAt that thought, a smirk touched Dong Muyun’s lips, and she quickly followed him.\nSu Ping, however, was oblivious to all this. He was currently mounted on Old Sha, scrolling through messages on his phone from the owner of the Secret Realm.",

      "content": "Chapter 290: Chapter 170: Seizing the Secret Realm Again! Damn Tomb Robbers!_2\nNiu Ba, the Forest Pig King. The name and title were actually quite amusing, but the man himself was still rather famous. Although he wasn’t as incredible as Yu Liangqing, the Fengdu Sword King—who, while at the Emperor-Level, had managed to defeat opponents of a higher level, specifically by bridging the gap to the Spirit Saint Level—nevertheless, this Forest Pig King’s reputation was not insignificant.\nSearching online, Su Ping learned that Niu Ba had originally been just a butcher who raised pig beasts. Later on, this Niu Ba personally developed a special evolution for pig beasts: the Pine Oil Wild Pig. It was a pig-class Pet Beast with the Wood Attribute. It transformed from an Ordinary-Level Pet Beast—which previously could only provide decent meat and was one of the most inferior types—into a creature with Commander-Level potential and formidable combat power. It wasn’t quite a meteoric rise, but it was close.\nIn the ancient Liang Dynasty, the hierarchy among Beast Tamers was also rigidly structured. To rise from a common butcher who slaughtered pigs to a King-Level Beast Tamer during those times, one could only imagine the hardships Niu Ba had faced. Therefore, Su Ping held great admiration for him. He had always respected those who rose from obscurity through their own efforts.\nHe had once thought he would be such a person—though, aside from hard work, he also had a cheat option. However, it seemed fate hadn’t granted him that opportunity, leaving him somewhat disappointed. Rising from obscurity was no longer something he could realistically hope for. He could only try to see how far he could reach, what sights he could behold, standing on the shoulders of giants!\nSo, in coming to the Secret Realm left behind by the historical figure Niu Ba, Su Ping arrived with a respectful heart, even though this place had already been picked almost clean.\nHe entered the wilderness. Su Ping waved his hand, and a pack of wolves appeared. Countless Forest Wolves scattered in all directions, swiftly beginning to search the area.\nSeizing the chance, Dong Muyun sidled up to Su Ping and asked in a roundabout way, \"Su Ping, are you familiar with the Dong Family? What are your thoughts on them?\"\nWhat is this woman asking that for?\nHowever, after pondering for a moment, he still shook his head. \"I’m not familiar with them, but I’m not too fond of them either.\"\nDong Muyun’s delicate brows arched. \"Why not?\"\n\"Because of you. The way they treat you—of course I don’t like them,\" Su Ping said matter-of-factly.\nA family that prioritized profit above all else, where even familial bonds were significantly diluted, might be relatively common among powerful clans and wealthy families, but Su Ping still found it dispiriting. Such families might well survive for countless years, and perhaps that was the best model for their growth. But Su Ping still didn’t like it.\nObviously, Dong Muyun misunderstood. Her eyes flickered, but true to her nature, Dong Muyun wouldn’t let her feelings show on her face. She wouldn’t react as overtly as Qin Xiaoxue; that was hardly likely. She merely pursed her lips, though their corners couldn’t help but curve upwards slightly.\nSu Ping shot the woman a suspicious glance.\nJust moments ago, she looked like someone owed her a fortune, and now this sudden change? Women... truly creatures far more complex than any Pet Beast.\nFortunately, he didn’t have much time to ponder it. In that brief moment, a wolf howl echoed from nearby. Su Ping was instantly invigorated. Leading Old Sha and the gathered wolf pack, they rushed to the location.\nIt was indeed a forest. The dense, sky-obscuring forest, though it hadn’t produced any plant-based Pet Beasts, possessed a somewhat eerie atmosphere. There, perched on a tree branch, Su Ping spotted another familiar entrance to a Secret Realm. It was still the slowly rotating spatial vortex. The surrounding spatial ripples lent the area an odd sense of being disconnected.\n\"This is it! Well done, Thirteen!\" Su Ping tossed a favorite blueberry tree fruit to the elite Forest Wolf that had found the Secret Realm’s entrance. Then, he turned his gaze to the spatial vortex and, without hesitation, stepped right into it as soon as all the Forest Wolves had arrived.\nHowever, despite being mentally prepared, Su Ping couldn’t help but feel immense disappointment. The Secret Realm he had eagerly come to was as barren as if a dog had gnawed it clean, not a speck left behind. It was a vast and boundless land. Besides the barren land, Su Ping could also see faint traces of past plant cultivation within the Secret Realm. However, the Secret Realm lacked sufficient residual energy. Even if some traces remained, it wasn’t nearly enough to rejuvenate this realm.\nRefusing to accept it, Su Ping circled around once more, then sighed.\nThis time, it was Dong Muyun beside him who offered consolation. \"This is pretty normal. I know a little about the people from the Qintian Monitor. The profession of Qintian Monitor has existed since ancient times. Now that the Dragon Nation has been established, its name was simply changed. Do you know what these guys were called in the Liang Dynasty and the eras before it?\"\n\"What?\" Su Ping asked, while wandering around with his legion of Forest Wolves.\n\"The official term was ’Touch Gold Officer,’ and those in charge of them were called ’Fei Qiu Zhonglang Generals.’ They explored Secret Realms and, unless it was a special Secret Realm with rules left by its master, they usually picked it clean.\"\nSu Ping was speechless.\nDamn it, thinking about it, isn’t that true? The Secret Realms left behind after the death of powerful Beast Tamers did indeed resemble the tombs of past generations. And what was left in these Secret Realms were precisely the treasures these Beast Tamers possessed in life. Calling these people Touch Gold Officers really made sense.\nSo, does that mean the unofficial ones are just common tomb robbers?\nThe Dragon Nation really did a thorough job with the name change,\nSu Ping mused.\nWhat connection did these specialized Secret Realm explorers actually have with a department that should have originally been focused on stargazing? Was it because the original name wasn’t auspicious enough?\nHe had hoped that those Qintian Monitor fellows might have left something behind for him to scavenge. Now it seemed wiser not to pit his luck against their professional thoroughness.\nStill, he felt somewhat indignant! Damn tomb robbers!\nSoon, Su Ping composed himself. Getting lucky once, like with the Fengdu Sword King, was enough. It was better to focus on earning his guaranteed rewards steadily.\nWith that, Su Ping shifted his focus, ignoring the astonished Dong Muyun. He merged his consciousness back into his Beast Taming Space. Last time, Su Ping had used a clever method, reaching into the collapsing Mysterious Realm Space of the Sword King’s Secret Realm to complete the absorption. The effectiveness of that absorption was unknown. But now, Su Ping stood firmly within the Secret Realm, ready to activate his ability according to the specific trait of Space Absorption.\nAs for Dong Muyun’s presence, when Su Ping had previously used this ability, he indeed needed some privacy. But not anymore. Especially not with Dong Muyun around.\nSpace Absorption wasn’t the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, nor was it some external cheat. It was his own genuinely awakened Space Characteristic; what was there to fear?\nAnyone objects? They can take it up with Second Master! Being a genius and a second-generation scion meant he could indeed act as he pleased.\nHis spiritual tendrils slowly extended, seeming to permeate the deepest parts of this Mysterious Realm Space through the void. His Beast Taming Space began to slowly connect with the Origin of this Forest Pig King’s Secret Realm. Then, he rapidly began to absorb its nourishing essence.\nDong Muyun watched Su Ping’s actions, actually somewhat curious as to what he was up to. After all, these thoroughly plundered Secret Realms weren’t just useless; they could even become troublesome if located in certain places, like within cities. And now Su Ping was actively seeking one out?\nWhat was he planning?\nDong Muyun watched as Su Ping’s expression began to change.\nFirst, a faint smile touched Su Ping’s lips. Dong Muyun pursed her own slightly, still considering it normal.\nThen, Su Ping’s mouth opened a bit wider. Dong Muyun frowned slightly, sensing something was amiss.\nFinally, as she observed Su Ping’s look of utter bliss, Dong Muyun began to grow suspicious.\nSuddenly, at that very moment, ripples and fluctuations appeared in the Mysterious Realm Space. Then, before Dong Muyun’s shocked eyes, the entire Secret Realm abruptly shattered and collapsed.\nDong Muyun gaped at the youth, who wore an expression of pure contentment.\nWhat in the world? Those official tomb raiders from the Qintian Monitor—no, wait, Touch Gold Officers—they only scavenge the items inside. But this kid... he directly blew up the entire ’tomb’?!",

      "content": "Chapter 291: Chapter 171 Feifei’s Direction? The Vision of Local Area Networking!\n\"What are you staring at? This Secret Realm is about to collapse, hurry up and get out!\"\nHaving opened his eyes, Su Ping put his wolf pack back into the Beast Taming Space and, seeing Dong Muyun still confused, he quickly spoke.\nDong Muyun looked perplexed.\nShe actually didn’t know that this Secret Realm was about to collapse?\nBut, was that rational?\nWas this collapse reasonable?\nDid this kid not quite understand what exactly was going on here?!\nAlthough this Secret Realm had been here for some years, it clearly wasn’t one that seemed about to collapse just by looking at it.\nThe two of them exited the Secret Realm.\nWatching the Secret Realm’s entrance gradually become fainter until it disappeared completely, Dong Muyun finally reacted, looking at Su Ping.\nHowever, since leaving this Secret Realm, Su Ping had not paid any more attention to her.\nAll his consciousness had merged into his own Beast Taming Space and his own enhancement.\nJust as he had anticipated.\nThis time, the Secret Realm yielded almost the same harvest as the last time when he absorbed from the Fengdu Sword King’s Secret Realm.\nHis very own Beast Taming Space had indeed expanded by roughly ten square meters.\nSimultaneously, based on this round of Space Absorption and the comparison with the previous one, he had gained further understanding of this ability.\nBeing in a Secret Realm, indeed, the Space Absorption ability seemed to activate more thoroughly, and the Origin it absorbed seemed to be more plentiful as well.\nAs for why this improvement wasn’t larger than last time, or was even slightly smaller, he roughly figured it was still an issue of how much Origin Power remained.\nThe Secret Realm of the Fengdu Sword King, Yu Liangqing, was not an abandoned one on the verge of being discarded. It had still retained part of its strength.\nIt was just because he had activated Old Qin’s defensive Shield inside, which forcibly ruptured that Secret Realm.\nThus, this time, besides his Realm upgrading by one Level and the further expansion of his Mysterious Realm Space, there was no other significant harvest.\nOf course, his Mysterious Realm Space did provide him with some feedback.\nIt was just like the last absorption.\nThe quantity of Origin absorbed was relatively too scarce, so Space Characteristics could not form within his Beast Taming Space.\nBut he was already quite satisfied.\nIf Space Characteristics were so easily obtained, the resources that allow Beast Tamers to acquire them wouldn’t be so treasured and rare.\nAnd as for himself, being able to continuously grow his own Beastmaster Space through the trait of Space Absorption... this kind of progression would drive any other Beast Tamer insane.\nMoreover, if every absorption resulted in a one-Level upgrade, then what need would he have for any tedious Meditation Method?\nWeren’t all these Secret Realms in Jianghai, waiting to be discarded, like giant Magic Potions for him?\nThat was what Su Ping thought.\nAnd that was what he did.\nHe spent the entire day, even to the extent of \"passing by his own home three times without entering,\" visiting all five Secret Realms near Linzhou.\nAfter that, Su Ping realized that things weren’t as simple as he had thought.\nOf course, his Beast Taming Space had grown significantly. All the various traits he absorbed had expanded his Beast Taming Space, adding a two-bedroom, two-living-room area on top of the existing three-bedroom, one-living-room space.\nA five-bedroom, three-living-room area, nearly three hundred square meters in total!\nSuch a Beast Taming Space was typically the size possessed by a newly promoted Commander Level Beast Tamer with a relatively shallow foundation.\nBut he was still only a Seventh Tier elite Beast Tamer.\nThat’s right, still Seventh Tier.\nAfter Su Ping performed Space Absorption on the remaining four Secret Realms in the vicinity of Linzhou all at once, essentially \"blowing up their graves,\" his Realm did not rise again.\nHis spiritual power had definitely increased, but it was clear...\n...this spatial trait of Space Absorption was merely icing on the cake when it came to increasing spiritual power.\nBathed in the light of the setting sun, a weary Su Ping returned to his base.\nAfter a full day of activity, Su Ping no longer possessed the spirited and proud demeanor he had when he left in the morning.\nHe had been running around all day. His body was fine, as he had driven when in the city, but his mind was exhausted!\nActivating Space Absorption also consumed energy.\nIf he hadn’t drunk a bottle of spiritual power recovery Magic Potion, he would probably be unconscious by now.\nBut even now, he wasn’t much better off.\nReturning to his room somewhat dizzily, Su Ping collapsed onto the bed, letting everything slip from his mind.\nAs he drifted off, a voice suddenly echoed inside the room,\n\"Master, would you like me to turn on the sandalwood incense? It’s good for spiritual power recovery!\"\nSu Ping nodded,\n\"Turn it on!\"\nAs soon as he spoke, a faint fragrance wafted through the room. It was called sandalwood, but it wasn’t traditional incense; it was an electric appliance.\nInhaling the scent, his mental fatigue indeed began to slowly fade.\nSu Ping sighed in satisfaction. However, just as he was about to fall asleep, his somewhat muddled mind suddenly cleared, and he jolted awake.\nWho was talking?\nFeifei?\nSu Ping suddenly became fully alert.\nFeifei was helping him operate the appliance?",

How did it activate it?\nCould it possibly grow hands?\nThat obviously doesn’t make sense.\nSu Ping suddenly sat up. \"Feifei?\"\n\"Master! I’m here!\"\nFeifei’s voice indeed sounded, but it wasn’t coming from its Mechanical Core; instead, it was coming from the speakers in the room.\nSu Ping looked at the speakers, then at the activated fragrance system, and the air conditioning, which had automatically adjusted to the most comfortable temperature.\nHe was starting to understand. \"Did you do this?\"\n\"Yes, Master. Every time you rest, the settings are like this!\"\nSu Ping certainly knew these were his settings, but he wondered how the little guy had managed it.\nAs if understanding Su Ping’s thoughts, Feifei then added, \"I used Psychic Perception and mental resonance to simulate the remote control systems of these smart home devices. They’re quite easy to control!\"\nSimulate remote control systems using Psychic Perception—an ability of spiritual power—and mental resonance? To achieve the effect of long-distance remote control?\nSu Ping scratched his head. \"Can Psychic Perception really be used like this?\"\nHe didn’t understand, but he was greatly shocked.\n\"Yes, this is what Feifei has achieved over the past few days. It’s also the first step in the Meditation Method Feifei has researched to help you cultivate, Master!\"\nHuh?\nSu Ping blinked. \"Meditation Method?\"\n\"That’s right! Master, your Talent is the best, so you don’t need to practice those ordinary Meditation Methods. Feifei will help create a Meditation Method that is more suitable for you.\"\nListening to Feifei’s words, Su Ping felt a bit odd.\nIt was like a man and woman in bed, after they’d finished, and the other half says to him, \"Don’t worry, I’m already very satisfied.\"\nOf course, compared to such perfunctory comfort, Feifei’s words carried a strange sense of \"I will take good care of you.\"\nDamn!\nWhat the hell is going on here!\nSu Ping suddenly sat up straight.\nHis Talent was unquestionable! Especially when it came to his own future Pet Beast!\nOf course, after so many days, he still hadn’t managed to re-enter the Beginner level with the Meditation Method, so he’d stopped worrying about it.\nIt must be because of his own mutated Pet Beasts!\nBut to create a Meditation Method?\nHe had never considered such a thing before.\nAfter all, in Qin Xiaoxue’s messages, the information about this Meditation Method indicated one thing: creating it was incredibly difficult.\nFeifei actually had such grand ambitions!?\nSu Ping felt great! Worthy of being the Pet Beast he had chosen!\nBut then, since it was his own Pet Beast, how could he leave such a challenging task entirely to the little guy!\nSu Ping was suddenly invigorated.\nHe looked at Feifei. \"Feifei, how is your progress?\"\nMechanical System Pet Beasts are extremely intelligent. This is their greatest advantage over other Pet Beasts. And as a Psychic Element Pet Beast, this was even more true for Feifei. Its wisdom and intelligence were certainly far superior to those of other Pet Beasts.\nFeifei ’nodded’ and reported the progress of its independent research over the past few days, \"I’ve completely analyzed the combination steps of the Meditation Method! From start to finish, I’ve divided it into three steps!\n\"First, the Beast Tamer’s spiritual power resonates, connecting with the Spirits of their Pet Beasts through their soul bond!\n\"Second, the Beast Tamer leads their Pet Beasts to meditate together.\n\"Third, the increase in spiritual power gained from the meditation of the Pet Beasts and the Beast Tamer is entirely merged with the Beast Tamer’s Spirit!\"\nActually, with Feifei putting it this way, the Meditation Method seemed quite simple.\nThree steps, just complete each one, and that’s it?\nBut it’s obviously not that simple, is it?\nFeifei continued, \"First, the Beast Tamer’s spiritual power resonance must remain constant from start to finish, matching the frequency of the Pet Beasts of the corresponding Attribute. Otherwise, the spiritual connection can’t be established, or it would be broken even if connected.\n\"Simultaneously, while the Beast Tamer is resonating and connecting with the Pet Beast’s Spirit, the content of their meditation must not disrupt this spiritual power resonance. Therefore, creating the Meditation Method’s content is of utmost importance!\n\"As for the third point, it might seem the simplest, but it also depends on the completeness and effectiveness of the Meditation Method to determine how much of the spiritual power enhancement can be retained by the Beast Tamer. Furthermore, I estimate that this third point’s outcome is also a criterion for judging the quality of a Meditation Method!\"\nSu Ping nodded. Then he asked Feifei a question, \"So, the reason I can’t achieve mental resonance is because your other two companions are mutated, is that it?\"\nFeifei, who had been chattering away just moments before, suddenly fell silent.\nAfter a full five seconds of silence, it continued, \"Yes. Their mental resonance differs from that of other Pet Beasts of their kind, which is why your resonance couldn’t connect with them, Master!\n\"They can’t change their own mental resonance, but I can! So I will work hard to help you cultivate your own Meditation Method, Master!\"\nLook at this!\nFor Feifei to have gained such deep insight in just a few days!\nAs its master, Su Ping felt deeply gratified!\nBut really, he was now quite interested.\n\"You mean, a typical Meditation Method involves the Beast Tamer resonating their Spirit to a specific frequency and then connecting with the Pet Beast through a soul bond. But you, Feifei, you actively initiate mental resonance and then connect to me, is that right?\"",

Just like that! Master, you are indeed clever!\"\nDamn it.\nAlthough it sounded a bit weird.\nBut if Feifei’s idea is feasible, doesn’t the thought of it seem pretty cool?\nHaving a Pet Beast assist with one’s meditation and training?\nKind of interesting.\n\"So now, what stage have you reached?\"\nSu Ping looked towards Feifei eagerly.\n\"Feifei is attempting to perform diverse simulations of spiritual power resonance, gaining freer control over it! Controlling the remote-controlled furniture in the room is just one aspect.\"\nSu Ping nodded.\nHe knew that this kind of thing could not be rushed.\nBut he had to admit, after this conversation with Feifei, he felt like he had suddenly grasped something.\nHe seemed no longer so perplexed about Feifei’s future.\nAnd at that moment, Su Ping suddenly thought of something.\nHe blinked and then suddenly asked, \"Feifei, do you know what Wi-Fi is?\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nFeifei appeared confused.\nBut Su Ping’s eyes lit up.\nIndeed, the term Wi-Fi didn’t exist in this world.\nOf course, wireless networks existed; they just didn’t use this term.\nHowever, Su Ping came from Earth in his past life.\nHe was very clear about some things.\nWireless networks, or Wi-Fi, were one aspect.\nWhat truly gave Su Ping a flash of inspiration was the corresponding concept in this area.\nHe had never thought before that Pet Beast Cultivation could also be developed in this way.\nBut now, thinking about it, it seemed not impossible.\nA local area network...\nSu Ping blinked, falling into deep thought.\nIndeed, if Feifei’s spiritual power could simulate the remote signal of a furniture remote control, even operate the furniture—turning it on or off, or activating various functions—without a remote...\n...then, couldn’t Feifei’s spiritual power also adapt its perception, transform into network signals, and directly interface with the networks of mobile devices?\nOrdinary computers and phones connect to data centers, but if Feifei could simulate these network signals, it could become a ’data center’ itself!\nThen, could it also use the network for control, forming a local interconnected network area?\nAnd control a myriad of things through the network?\nSu Ping suddenly felt energized, his previously tired spiritual power becoming excited once more.\nHe looked sharply at Feifei. \"Feifei, can you sense the signal frequency used by devices like computers, cell phones, and the like?\"\nAs expected, Feifei nodded.\n\"I can sense it, but simulating that signal is much more difficult than the room’s remote control signals. The signal itself is very strong, and with Feifei’s current spiritual power, simulating and interfacing with it is quite challenging.\"\nSpiritual power not strong enough? That wasn’t a problem!\nWith future Level increases, these would be minor issues.\nBut really, could it be done?!\nInterfacing with the network would not only allow anytime, anywhere connectivity to the internet but also enable control over many things through the network.\nSo, even though Feifei couldn’t physically connect its Mechanical Core to a mechanical body, could it be controlled through the network?\nIn that instant, this idea flashed through Su Ping’s mind like a bolt of lightning.\nThis realization struck Su Ping so intensely that goosebumps erupted all over him again, and he could hardly contain his excitement.\nHe wanted to get some Psychic Element resources for Feifei right away, let it consume them, and then start attempting to simulate and connect to that network signal.\nSu Ping had never been one to just keep ideas in his head.\nWhen it came to the future direction of his own Pet Beast, time was not a concern for him.\nWith this thought, Su Ping immediately called Uncle Guan.\nAs the Heart of Woods’ business expanded, the Heart of Water lake was developed, and the botanical garden in the hills was also being systematically constructed, Guan Qianshan became even busier.\nHe used to be seen occasionally around the Heart of Woods Cultivation Base, but now he was hardly ever seen.\nHowever, his phone was clearly still very easy to reach.\n\"Hello, Su Ping?\"\n\"Uncle Guan, I need some Psychic Element resources right now. Send them over to me; Ordinary Level will do.\"\nFeifei was only at the Ordinary First Rank; higher-level Psychic Element resources would be unusable for it.\nMoreover, Su Ping could only think how fortunate it was that Feifei was of the Psychic Element; if it were of other Attributes, resources corresponding to those Attributes would be unusable.\nAfter all, without the ability to consume them orally, it was often quite troublesome.\n\"Alright! Just wait a bit!\"\nWith the expansion of the Heart of Woods, the procurement of Low-level resources had also increased considerably compared to before.\nPsychic Element resources were rare, but they had some.\nAfter all, Ordinary Elite Level ones weren’t too expensive.\nThe call ended.\nFeifei spoke again.\n\"This signal frequency is also very interesting...\"\nSu Ping was startled.\nThe radio waves of a phone call are a type of electromagnetic wave.\nBut... could Feifei’s spiritual power even sense and simulate these as well?\nDoes that mean that in the future, even making phone calls could be...\nHISS... Su Ping hardly dared to think about it.\nOf course, that made sense; Su Ping couldn’t apply the physics from his previous life to this peculiar world of Beast Tamers.\nIt clearly wouldn’t be logical.\nHe didn’t have to wait too long. Soon after, Uncle Guan personally delivered a few items.",

The Vision of Local Area Networking!_4\nA test tube of silvery-white liquid and two small, crystal-like stones were presented.\n\"Dream Water, two Spirit-Nurturing Stones! I was afraid you were anxious, so I brought these over first. If it’s not enough, I’ll go get some more,\" a voice said.\n\"That’s enough, that’s enough,\" Su Ping replied, taking the items.\nThen he said to his pet, \"Feifei, come and try this!\"\nFeifei appeared quite happy.\nIts efforts had been seen by its master! Its direction had been recognized by its master.\nHaving gained sentience, Feifei had already come to accept that it was seemingly a discarded Mechanical Core. It believed it was only capable of being a standard intelligent control system for machinery, much like its unawakened kin. Yet now, it suddenly sensed the meaning of its own existence.\n\"Do you know how to use Psychic Element resources? Connect and absorb them with your spiritual power!\" Su Ping asked.\n\"Yes!\" Feifei’s reply was crisp and clear.\nSu Ping placed the three low-level Psychic Element resources before it.\nSure enough, Feifei’s spiritual power swirled around the Dream Water, which was evidently the easiest to absorb. The silvery-white liquid in the tube visibly and slowly became transparent. The silvery-white substance seemed to vanish as if into thin air.\nAt the same time, a light radiated from Feifei’s body. Spiritual power, when highly concentrated, manifested as light waves.\nUndoubtedly, this tube of Dream Water had transformed Feifei’s spiritual power. It jumped two levels straight, from ordinary First Rank to ordinary Third Rank!\nAt this stage, it was indeed relatively easier for a Pet Beast’s Realm to improve. Simultaneously, Feifei’s spiritual power also became even more formidable.\n\"Now, try again,\" Su Ping instructed. \"See if you can simulate a network signal.\"\nSu Ping immediately turned on his computer and phone. He then deliberately started downloading some large files to push the network signal to its peak at that moment. Feifei’s perception seemed to be maximized, and the entire room fell into complete silence.\nSu Ping did not watch Feifei; instead, he focused on the network fluctuations on his phone and computer.\nAs expected, about five to six minutes later, the network began to show instability. The download speed revealed intermittent progress, marked by significant surges and drops. For a few seconds, it even plummeted to 0! Then, for another few seconds, it spiked to an unimaginable level, far exceeding the maximum download speed of his home network!\nThis was obviously impossible.\nHowever, the network download soon seemed to stabilize again. But at this moment, as Su Ping observed the activity on his computer and phone, he experienced a very peculiar sensation. It felt as if all the content displayed exuded a strange quality.\nSuddenly, a folder appeared on the computer screen. Then, a string of characters materialized on what looked like a blank document within it.\n’Master, I succeeded! This signal frequency is so weird. Why can it transmit so much information? The transmission mode of this signal frequency is amazing...’\nThese words appeared on screen, accompanied by Feifei’s voice, which emanated from the Mechanical Core. This created a very peculiar and abstract sensation.\nBut Su Ping revealed a smile.\nNetwork data centers utilize a special type of signal that transcends geographical location. And if Feifei’s spiritual power could simulate this signal, Su Ping could go online wirelessly from anywhere.\nThe kind that doesn’t cost money!\nOf course, it would be unreasonable to expend so much effort just to save a bit on internet fees. Nor was Su Ping aiming merely to acquire a hacker Pet Beast capable of network connections. What truly excited him was the potential this capability held for Feifei’s future!\nIf Feifei could connect via wireless networks, could it then control other Mechanical Pet Beasts? He would just need to install a signal transmitter on the bodies of those Mechanical Pet Beasts or machines to establish a connection. Even Mechanical Cores that hadn’t fully awakened but could still integrate with machinery would suffice! The cost-effectiveness would be maximized.\nThinking of this, Su Ping suddenly recalled the intelligent core extraction machine in his lab, as well as those smart supercars. These types of devices could be connected to Feifei via the network, forming a massive, self-contained local area network for remote, or even ultra-long-distance, control.\nAt this thought, Su Ping blinked.\nCould it be that his casual remark to Leng Ye about wanting a thousand or so intelligent supercars was actually going to come true?",

      "content": "Chapter 295: Chapter 172: Elf Wolf! The Advent of a New Product!\n「Imperial Capital.」\nHere lay the true heart of Dragon Nation. All internal organizations within Dragon Nation were gathered here. The headquarters of the two most important associations, the Beast Master Association and the Breeder Association, were both located here. At the same time, the headquarters of other associations, such as the Refiners Association and the Mechanics Association, were also all situated in the Imperial Capital. In addition, there were many various types of department headquarters. The Qintian Monitor was undoubtedly among them.\nWithin the headquarters of the Qintian Monitor, inside an office, a man looked at a series of prompts on the backend system with some annoyance. The man’s name was Huang Tianbing, and he was none other than the Chief Supervisor of the Qintian Monitor. As the leading figure of the Qintian Monitor, he had an extensive understanding of all its members within Dragon Nation and held the highest authority to mobilize them. He could be described as a figure with real power. Nevertheless, even those with such authority sometimes found their hands tied.\nFor example, a couple of days ago, a certain prominent figure had contacted him by phone. This person claimed to have secured a position within the Qintian Monitor for their grandchild—the grand-sounding post of \"Herald of Dawn.\"\nOf course, that’s just the external title,\nHuang Tianbing mused.\nIn reality, it’s nothing more than a records clerk and inspector responsible for documenting the conditions of Secret Realms.\nAlthough this was the most basic membership in the Qintian Monitor, not even granting the qualification to be among the first to explore Secret Realms, it still counted as being a member.Had anyone else asked him for such a favor, he would have flatly refused. It was only because that figure in Dragon Nation—renowned for his virtues (and notorious for his ill deeds)—had made the request that he reluctantly agreed. He had agreed to give face to that powerful figure. Moreover, he had kept a little trick up his sleeve: from the backend system, he could monitor all of Su Ping’s activities, any feedback received, and any specific investigations into Secret Realms.\nAs expected, just a few days after he had entered this young fellow Su Ping’s details into the system, the lad had managed to stir up trouble. The series of messages popping up in his administrative backend made his head spin:\n[Secret Realm Inspector Su Ping has submitted a report: ’Jianghai Secret Realm No. 972’ has collapsed and disappeared. The number and specific information will be archived in ’Jianghai Secret Realm Incidents’ records. Approve?]\n[Secret Realm Inspector Su Ping has submitted a report: ’Jianghai Secret Realm No. 1005’ has collapsed and disappeared. The number and specific information will be archived in ’Jianghai Secret Realm Incidents’ records. Approve?]\n[...]\nIn a single day, this young master had chosen to report five Secret Realms in Jianghai Forest Province as collapsed and gone, effectively removing them from the map.\nThis was no trivial matter. It wasn’t as if those Secret Realms posed no further danger and were simply waiting to collapse naturally. Record-keeping of Secret Realms must be accurate and rigorous! Every week, local inspectors went out to check and confirm their status. Secret Realms were unstable entities; if any fluctuations occurred after they were prematurely removed from the map, it could lead to a huge mess. If something happened later, how could the Qintian Monitor possibly shoulder that responsibility? Other departments envied the Qintian Monitor for its seemingly cushy job, which allowed its members to scavenge through various Secret Realms. But did they see the significant risks and responsibilities involved? Especially dealing with the aftermath, which had always been the Qintian Monitor’s most troublesome worry. What on earth was this young master playing at now? Huang Tianbing truly couldn’t comprehend what could possibly be amusing about the Qintian Monitor’s work with Secret Realms.\nHe was growing increasingly irritable.\nJust as he was about to reject all these vexing notifications—reports he felt powerless to change yet couldn’t ignore—someone knocked on his office door.\n\"Come in.\"\nThe person who entered made Huang Tianbing’s headache worsen. He furrowed his brow and asked, \"Which Secret Realm is causing problems now?\"\nThe visitor was one of the Qintian Monitor’s Deputy Supervisors. The Qintian Monitor had three Deputy Supervisors, each with distinct responsibilities. This particular Deputy Supervisor was in charge of collating reports on special situations discovered by explorers in various Secret Realms and overseeing their resolution. Secret Realms were not static; the fact that Dragon Nation and even other countries had similar departments underscored the immense importance attributed to them. Some Secret Realms could even cause great destruction in the real world. Undoubtedly, most of the situations Deputy Supervisor Lin reported were of this critical nature.\nWhile there were stable Secret Realms that Beast Tamers could freely enter and leave, there were also, naturally, unstable ones. Some Secret Realms, for various reasons, couldn’t dissipate naturally. This could lead to the energies left behind in the Beast Taming Spaces by deceased Beast Tamers leaking into the outside world, severely impacting the local ecology and public safety.\nHowever, this time, Huang Tianbing was mistaken. Deputy Supervisor Lin’s tightly furrowed brow made Huang Tianbing tense up.\nCould an incident similar to the one in Sichuan Province ten years ago have occurred again? Back then, a spatial entrance had experienced widespread instability and disorder. Twenty to thirty Ferocious Beasts born within a Secret Realm had suddenly appeared in a busy district of Sichuan Province, resulting in hundreds, possibly thousands, of casualties.\nBut clearly, it was a false alarm.\n\"Boss,\" Deputy Supervisor Lin began, \"there’s been a situation in Jianghai Forest Province. According to our records, the five Secret Realms there, the ones our people regularly check, have suddenly disappeared!\"\n\"Hm?\" Huang Tianbing was taken aback. He was about to speak but then paused.\nHe subconsciously glanced at Deputy Supervisor Lin.\nCould the backend messages from that young master who got in through connections also have reached Deputy Supervisor Lin’s inbox?",

      "content": "Chapter 296: Chapter 172: Elf Wolf! The Advent of a New Product!_2\n\"Our people have investigated it? Who investigated it? This is no joke!\"\n\"Liao Gongcheng, Wang Yumin, and Han Hu have all led teams to investigate. Boss, you also think there’s something fishy, right? Should I personally lead people to Jianghai to check it out? The simultaneous disappearance of these five Secret Realms is indeed quite odd.\"\nHuang Tianbing pursed his lips and glanced at his backend again. These five messages had been sent a few days ago. In other words, the young master had known about it for quite some time and was even the main person handling it...\nHow did he do it? Did he do it? If any worthless Mysterious Realm Space could collapse directly after being looted, imagine how much trouble it would save the Qintian Monitor.\nSo, after thinking for thirty seconds, Huang Tianbing arrived at a guess that didn’t quite match his earlier thoughts.\nCould it be that the young master wasn’t just messing around? Did he truly have some method within these Secret Realms? A way to directly collapse a Secret Realm?\nWith that thought, Huang Tianbing’s eyes lit up.\nLooking at the backend responses on the computer, he glanced at Deputy Lin and said, \"Old Lin, you go back first. I’m going to look into what’s going on with this matter.\"\nDeputy Lin gave his boss a strange look, nodded, and left the office.\nEnergized, Huang Tianbing leisurely viewed those messages. Then he opened them and chose to reply:\n’Dear Inspector Su Ping, we have received your feedback and have actively dispatched commissioners to investigate it, confirming the results of your feedback! Thank you for your contributions to the Qintian Monitor. We look forward to your continued feedback.’\nHuang Tianbing utilized his experience as a receptionist. He replied to each message in turn and approved all of them.\nNaturally, Huang Tianbing was not in a hurry to ask how the young master did it. After all, even if asked, there was no guarantee of a response. It wouldn’t have been an issue for an ordinary person to inquire indirectly. But since the young master was personally cautioned by ’that person,’ it wouldn’t be appropriate to probe.\nHowever... if the young master really had a way... Dragon Nation currently has some Secret Realms that are very troublesome for the Qintian Monitor. Could the young master help solve them?\nHuang Tianbing blinked.\nHe would need to find an opportunity to meet with Young Master Su!\nAt this moment, Huang Tianbing’s expression was somewhat invigorated, his eyes filled with anticipation. Where was the defiance he had shown just before?\n...\nSu Ping looked down at the backend response from the Qintian Monitor’s official app.\nThe Qintian Monitor’s response was quite polite, wasn’t it?\nHe nodded and didn’t think much of it. Ever since he had swept through Linzhou’s five Secret Realms, Su Ping hadn’t been in a hurry to leave the urban area to scour the rest of Jianghai Province for Secret Realms.\nHe was too busy.\nFeifei had made some progress in a certain direction, and Su Ping wanted the little guy to thoroughly research controlling other Mechanical Cores via a local network. However, the little guy was currently more interested in researching the Meditation Method. So Su Ping simply went with what the little guy wanted. They hadn’t officially formed a contract yet, and besides, Feifei was also pursuing his own interests.\nFor the following period, Su Ping delved into another matter. Su Ping no longer needed to worry much about Qian Yi, as the little one continued to study Swordsmanship quietly on her own. Therefore, Su Ping refocused his attention on the Forest Wolf.\nThe Evolution of the Elf Wolf!\nThis Evolution was something he had put off for a long time. The main reason for studying this Evolution was for the research into ’Elementalization’ during the Forest Wolf’s Evolution. Su Ping wanted to integrate this direction with Xiao Qing’s Evolution. Meanwhile, in Su Ping’s Forest Wolf legion, there was no need for regular Forest Wolves. But as a purely medical Pet Beast, the Elf Wolf was indeed very necessary.\nThe Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas had already analyzed and detailed the optimized Cultivation method for the Elf Wolf some time ago. So Su Ping, who already had a deep understanding of the Forest Wolf, naturally didn’t find it difficult to fully cultivate an Elf Wolf. That’s how he spent the past few days.\nWith the help of Li Shu and Guan Lili, this type of Cultivation and Evolution went even more smoothly. And today was the day to see the results.\nThe evolutionary requirements for the Elf Wolf were much higher than those for the regular Forest Wolf. Even among the Heart of Woods Forest Wolf pack, only a few met the criteria. A Forest Wolf needed to reach a level above elite Seventh Tier, and at the same time, its ’Self-Healing’ Skill had to reach Mastery Level.\nWhat did that entail?\nFrom a certain perspective, the requirements for the Evolution to Elf Wolf were even higher than those for the Wanmu Wolf. Of course, the difficulty of Cultivation for Evolution was quite low.\nIn Su Ping’s Forest Wolf pack, the most suitable was the one called ’San Ha,’ who had been the first among them. During summer, San Ha was the only Forest Wolf in the pack whose Self-Healing had reached Mastery Level. As a result, it later became a training target for many other Forest Wolves to practice their Skills on. This often made San Ha look at its master with reproachful eyes.\nHowever, Su Ping felt that the little guy should be grateful to him.\nBecause it was with his help—that, two days ago, the little one made what could be called a historic breakthrough!\nSan Ha’s Self-Healing Skill, reputed to be the most difficult Skill for a Forest Wolf to improve, became the first Skill within the Heart of Woods to break through to Perfection Level after Su Ping took over.",

      "content": "Chapter 297: Chapter 172: Elf Wolf! The Advent of a New Product!_3\nSo, the first to be recognized by Su Ping and evolved into an Elf Wolf was San Ha. It had been brought to the brink of death from severe injuries. Then, it consumed the special resources ’Soul Dust’ and ’Elite Slime Core’. After waiting three days, it used the Life Series resource ’Fruit of Life’, along with his own magic potion, ’Heart of the Wolf’, to perfectly complete the evolution.\nIt was very simple. In fact, Li Shu and Guan Lili mastered the evolutionary method just by watching the process. The only slight challenge lay in controlling the near-death state. Of course, this was the fool-proof version perfected by the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas. In the original version, the Forest Wolf needed to be maintained in a near-death state for three days without dying. This was to lessen the connection between soul and body, enabling the Forest Wolf to comprehend the true essence of life. That was the hard part. The perfected method was now much simpler.\nThe three days passed. San Ha, who was knocking on death’s door with a somewhat ethereal body, consumed the Fruit of Life. The Light of Evolution then inevitably shone. San Ha, initially an Elite Level Forest Wolf from the Heart of Woods, had now reached Elite Peak thanks to targeted resource cultivation and enhancement training. This evolution would undoubtedly allow San Ha to break through to the Commander Level. It meant that another Commander Level Forest Wolf Evolver had appeared amongst Su Ping’s army of wolves.\nThe Light of Evolution gradually faded under the attentive gazes of Li Shu, Guan Lili, and Su Ping. This was especially true for the former two. Having been in the Heart of Woods for such a long time, they had naturally witnessed Old Sha’s Wanmu Wolf form. However, that form had enormous potential, and it seemed that its evolution was quite difficult as well. If they were to evolve in the future, they might not be able to afford it. But as for the Elf Wolf, also a rare evolutionary method, they roughly estimated that it probably wouldn’t pose any issues for them. Moreover, this was a Forest Wolf whose cultivation and evolution they had both participated in. Any first experience is worth remembering and anticipating. Consequently, the two of them were even more invested in San Ha’s transformation than Su Ping was.\nThe Light of Evolution slowly faded. The next moment, a figure appeared before their eyes. This figure drastically differed from the previous Forest Wolf. Though it was still green in appearance, this shade of green now had an indescribable ethereal quality. Furthermore, it seemed almost translucent when looked at directly. All over its body, specks of vibrant green light pulsed with a life-giving aura. It still retained the form of a wolf but lacked any trace of ferocity; instead, it exhibited an indefinable elegance and dignity. Though these two words might sound strange to describe a wolf, it was the undeniable truth.\nUnlike the Wanmu Wolf, the Elf Wolf was light and graceful, lacking the draped branches. Within its ethereal aura, it even seemed somewhat frail. It was truly like an elf of the forest, lightly dancing through the trees!\nThe Elf Wolf had emerged!\nA cry, vastly different from any previous Wolf Howl, rang out, carrying San Ha’s excitement and drawing the attention of numerous Forest Wolves. Countless Forest Wolves felt an even closer affinity to this brand-new evolutionary body. The Life Series, by its very nature, was the attribute most cherished by Pet Beasts. Symbolizing the power of life and nature, it was revered by nearly all Pet Beasts.\nAmidst the excited stares of Li Shu and Guan Lili, Su Ping activated his Eye of Truth and looked at his first Elf Wolf:\n[Elf Wolf (Wild)]\n[Attribute: Life]\n[Current Level: Commander Third Rank]\n[Racial Potential: First Stage Monarch]\n[Skills: Life Absorption (Proficient), Life Blessing (Proficient), Elementalization (Beginner), Life Cage (Proficient), Heart of Woods (Proficient), Rapid Healing (Perfection), Elf Aura (Beginner)]\nWow, Su Ping had anticipated it, but he couldn’t help nodding after actually seeing it.\nPerhaps due to the Self-Healing skill reaching Perfection, San Ha’s race limit had directly broken through the usual upper limit of the Elf Wolf to reach Monarch Level. Aside from the cultivated Heart of Woods, all the other skills were of the Life Series. Life Absorption could absorb Life Force from other life forms to heal oneself, and Life Blessing could bless other individuals, essentially providing buffs and increasing healing speed. No need to elaborate on Rapid Healing and Elementalization. Life Cage, however, was quite interesting—it was a Life Series variant skill of the Forest Wolf’s ’Vine Strangling.’\n[Life Cage (Proficient): Creates a cage with the power of life. Beings within the cage will continuously lose Life Force and Energy.]\nAmong all these skills, the core one was undoubtedly the Elf Aura, the signature skill of the Elf Wolf:\n[Elf Aura (Beginner): Allies within a radius of 50 meters have increased movement and action speeds! The friendliness of all neutral beings towards them is enhanced!]\nThis effect? While simple, it has to be said, it’s truly a very practical ability.\nAfter all, Su Ping hadn’t put much faith in the Elf Wolf before. Now, seeing it firsthand, it certainly lived up to its reputation—genuinely lacking direct offensive combat skills. However, its supportive effects could be considered remarkably versatile.",

The Emergence of a New Product!_4\nFrom this perspective, it wasn’t just a ’medic’ for my future Forest Legion, but also a ’buff elite’!\nIt can also provide auras!\nIn a squad’s configuration, the Elf Wolf is indeed indispensable.\nNo wonder. It’s no wonder that while many Beast Tamers don’t choose the Forest Wolf for their first or second Pet Beast, a significant number opt to evolve a Forest Wolf into an Elf Wolf for their third.\nWhen breaking through to the Monarch Level is difficult, three Pet Beasts are the standard configuration for most people.\nAnd when three Pet Beasts fight together, having such a pure auxiliary Pet Beast can produce an extraordinary effect in many situations.\nAt the same time, as expected, the Forest Wolf entry in the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas lit up once again. Su Ping had seen this once before when Old Sha evolved. This time was the same as the last. On the evolutionary tree of the Forest Wolf, with the Forest Wolf Catalog as the base, a new fork once again appeared. This fork showed the ethereal and dreamy Elf Wolf standing before them. The image in the Catalog entry showed the Elf Wolf standing on a bamboo branch, looking back with supreme grace.\nAt the same time, new feedback also appeared on the Forest Wolf Catalog:\n[The Forest Wolf Catalog has recorded an Evolutionary Body entry: Elf Wolf form. Earned Experience Points: 600!]\n[You may enter the Forest Wolf Catalog to further investigate the Elf Wolf form analysis.]\n[The Elf Wolf form is a branch on the Forest Wolf’s Evolution Chart. Therefore, the Elf Wolf form entry has no Level Experience Points. Any Experience Points gained from it will be reflected back onto the Forest Wolf Catalog!]\n600 Experience Points. The 1,200 Experience Points spent earlier on perfecting Evolution and Cultivation methods are now half recouped. Not bad, not bad.\nSu Ping nodded in satisfaction, a smile in his eyes. He gestured to Guan Lili and Li Shu, prompting them to try training San Ha in using its own Skills. This allowed Su Ping to directly experience the effects of the Elf Wolf’s many auxiliary Skills.\nSu Ping was, of course, satisfied.\nIt wasn’t just because this further solidified the future Legion Pet Beast configuration centered around Xiao Qing, or because it further perfected the Forest Wolf Catalog. There was another gain that truly pleased him.\nDuring these past few days, while he had initiated the Elf Wolf’s Evolution and was waiting for San Ha to complete it, he hadn’t been merely idling. Instead, he had used the time to create a new little gadget.\nSoul Dust combined with an Elite Slime Core can replace the near-death process of Elementalization in the Forest Wolf’s Evolution.\nSo, if these two materials are combined, could they produce some new chemical reactions?\nThat’s how Pet Beast Cultivation research works; once a good direction is confirmed, any deviations that arise can be gradually adjusted.\nSo, over these three days, Su Ping had been in the laboratory, tinkering and creating another item. It used Soul Dust and an Elite Slime Core as the main ingredients. With Undead Crystal, Soulmate Grass, and Flux Shards as auxiliary materials, he had created a brand-new Magic Potion. After a period of experimentation and research, along with reviewing various materials and experiences, the formulation was finally approaching perfection. The only remaining step was to conduct clinical trials. This would require a large number of other Pet Beasts, or even human Beast Tamers, for this new Magic Potion.\nAfter all, over the past month or so, he had seen substantial cash dividends from Pingyun Company being credited to his account.\nIt was clear Dong Muyun was working very hard over there.\nSu Ping had previously demanded a majority share in the company, and one of the conditions was the infusion of funding for subsequent research.\nHe considered himself an honorable man, not the type to make promises and then abandon them.\nAnd this Magic Potion prototype, which he had named \"Heart of Illusion,\" would become Pingyun Company’s next new product if all went according to plan.\nThus, Su Ping took out his phone and called Dong Muyun again:\n\"Get ready, we’re starting clinical trials for a new research product!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 299: Chapter 173: The Illusory Heart! Battle for the Plant-Type Wild Pet Beast!\n\"Illusionary Heart?\"\nThe potion in the test tube was as clear as water. However, only when slightly shaken could one see the glittering, star-like sparkles inside the tube.\nDong Muyun wasn’t surprised by the name at all.\nShe had also grown accustomed to Su Ping’s naming methods.\nEven recently, she had heard that in the Heart of Woods Cultivation Base—previously the Tianyun Resort—this guy had renamed a section to the ’Heart of Cloud’ area.\nThe vast base was temporarily divided into the Heart of Woods Cultivation Center, Heart of Cloud Resort, the Pet Beast Training and Combat Pavilion, residential areas, and the man-made Heart of Water fishing lake area.\nThe Magic Potions he developed followed a similar naming pattern.\nThe previous Heart of the Wolf, and now the Illusionary Heart.\nHowever, compared to the former, this Illusionary Heart struck Dong Muyun as even more inconceivable.\nProducts similar to Heart of the Wolf weren’t unheard of in the market; there were many competitors with similar products.\nThis wasn’t limited to Wolf Pets; enhancements existed for all Pet Beasts that consumed resource Magic Potions.\nThey existed too.\nBut this bottle of Illusionary Heart in front of her was something she had never seen before—a truly miraculous Magic Potion.\nThe effect of Illusionary Heart was very simple, bordering on rudimentary.\nAfter consumption, for a corresponding period, a Beast Tamer or Pet Beast would enter an Elementalization state, granting them a high degree of immunity to direct physical damage.\nYes, that was the only effect.\nIt was identical to the Origin reward Talent Su Ping obtained after activating the Gold Elemental Elf.\nNaturally, it was because of this Talent that Su Ping deepened his understanding of Elementalization, which led him to deduce this research path in the evolution method for the Elf Wolf.\nBut just as Elementalization was significant for Su Ping, such a Magic Potion meant that Beast Tamers had to worry far less about being ’picked off’ by opponents targeting the back line.\nFor Pet Beasts, it granted them the initiative in an attack!\nAlthough the duration was brief, in a real Beast Tamer battle, a single second could mean the difference between life and death. Such an item was an invaluable treasure for those engaged in illicit activities!\nReading through the summarized experimental data, Dong Muyun couldn’t help but sigh with emotion.\nHer decision to leave Tianyun back then had been the right bet!\nIllusionary Heart: a short-term, state-effect Magic Potion.\nIt was ineffective when consumed by Monarch Level and above Pet Beasts. For Beast Tamers, the effects were greatly diminished, lasting only 1-2 seconds.\nFor those below Monarch Level—from Ordinary Level to Commander Level—the duration varied roughly from one and a half minutes to 10 seconds.\nOne could terminate the state prematurely. Alternatively, in most cases, the illusory Elementalization state would automatically end if the Pet Beast activated a Skill.\nThe resources required were much more precious than those for Heart of the Wolf.\nThe two main resources were of Elite Peak Level. The auxiliary ingredient, ’Flowing Light Fragment,’ although not an Elite Level resource, was extremely rare and thus relatively valuable.\nHowever, the actual cost of production was only around 50,000-60,000!\nIndeed, Soul Dust and Elite Slime Cores were both Elite Level resources. However, each portion of these resources could typically produce more than a dozen doses of the potion.\nAfter all, these two resources, when used in the Elf Wolf’s evolution process, were meant to make Elementalization a permanent Skill. Since this potion only granted a temporary effect, using the full measure of these resources would be unrealistic.\n\"How about it?\"\nSu Ping, looking through the experimental data feedback, nodded in satisfaction.\nMost importantly, this Magic Potion still had no negative side effects. There were even instances of a slight enhancement to spiritual power. It could be said to be quite perfect.\nDong Muyun, standing to the side, glanced at Su Ping, who was clearly fishing for a compliment, but she ultimately indulged his vanity:\n\"Incredible!\"\nThat short exclamation, ’Incredible!’, indeed encompassed all her feelings.\nTruly incredible.\nDong Muyun could feel that this product also had the potential to be a hit.\nDon’t underestimate it just because its primary function seems less impactful than Heart of the Wolf’s, and remember, Magic Potions are generally not allowed in standard Pet Beast battles.\nHowever, this item wasn’t primarily intended for ordinary Beast Tamers among the general populace.\nIt was an essential strategic material for the military and the Beast Master Association, and a vital life-saving tool for exploring Secret Realms.\nThis was especially true after their collaboration with the military was finalized. In fact, through Lin Lei’s introduction, Wolf Pet units from Legions in other regions had already tentatively begun purchasing Heart of the Wolf from Pingyun.\nDong Muyun was all too aware of the immense purchasing power held by these Legions and the Beast Master Association.\nOf course, Illusionary Heart certainly couldn’t achieve the same widespread popularity or universal appeal as Heart of the Wolf.\nHowever, if a company only produced a single product, it would hardly be enough to gain widespread public recognition.\nAfter all, even in a society shaped by the Beast Master Civilization, a company still needs brand power!\nSuch an unprecedented life-saving Magic Potion could further establish Pingyun’s reputation, laying the foundation for Pingyun to eventually expand beyond Jianghai and become a titan in the Dragon Nation.\nWith this thought, a smile spread across Dong Muyun’s lips.\nCasting an odd glance at the woman’s daydreaming, Su Ping finally interjected:\n\"What’s the planned price?\"\nDong Muyun gathered her thoughts and after some contemplation, said:\n\"This item can’t follow the low-profit, high-volume model like Heart of the Wolf. Besides, as a strategic, life-saving tool, it’s unlikely to be purchased in massive quantities. If the cost is as you said, what do you think about pricing it around 800,000? For the internal wholesale price, 600,000 per bottle. How does that sound?\"",

Battle for the Plant-Type Wild Pet Beast!_2\nSu Ping was speechless.\nThat damned Heart of the Wolf, was it even considered small profits and quick turnover? A cost of less than 30,000, selling for 250,000 on the market, and 180,000 a bottle for internal supply to the Legion and the Beast Master Association. A 500 percent profit margin, and that’s still not good enough? Of course, labor, advertising, and such also cost money, but surely not to such an exaggerated extent? Now this Illusionary Heart is even more ruthless, demanding tenfold right off the bat?\nAfter giving it some thought, Su Ping said, \"Should we conduct some market research?\"\n\"With no similar competing products on the market, how can you conduct research? Monopoly-type products are supposed to be expensive! True, there are similar resources, but those are Commander Level resources, the kind that go for millions...\"\nDong Muyun’s brow furrowed slightly.\n\"Moreover, don’t assume the theoretical profit is that high. First off, there’s a chance of producing substandard Magic Potions. There’s also the cost of advertising, labor, and possibly even needing to develop new production lines and factories as an initial investment for the new Magic Potions...\n\"Additionally, this type of product is positioned differently; it’s unlikely that individuals will make large-batch purchases in a short amount of time...\"\n\"Alright, alright. You handle it,\" Su Ping waved his hand, leaving professional matters to the professionals.\nHe should just stick to counting his money; pondering these complicated matters was indeed just asking for more headaches.\nSo, Su Ping stood up. \"Then I’ll leave it to you. If there’s nothing else, I’m off. Please get those patents sorted out for me as soon as possible; I don’t want to make another trip.\"\nHowever, just then, Dong Muyun suddenly said, \"Wait a second.\"\nMeeting Su Ping’s puzzled gaze, Dong Muyun said, \"Actually, there is something. I’m not sure if you’d be interested.\"\nSu Ping looked at her in surprise.\nDong Muyun smiled and said, \"How’s the Heart of Woods project coming along?\"\nAt the mention of this, Su Ping indeed smiled.\nPingyun was a channel for making money, but Heart of Woods was his home and his pursuit.\nInitially, when Su Ping had just returned, Su Anyong had left a message saying he wanted to build the largest Forest Wolf Cultivation base in Dragon Nation with him.\nThat was indeed one of Su Ping’s pursuits as well.\nSo, although Pingyun was more profitable, when it came to the level of dedication, it couldn’t compare to his own Heart of Woods.\nDong Muyun had a top-floor room at ’Heart of Yun’, and nowadays, she increasingly stayed there. Naturally, she had some understanding of Su Ping’s plans for Heart of Woods.\nThis rascal wants to create a real Pet Beast kingdom in the suburbs!\nThough it was still just the beginning, things were already progressing in an orderly manner.\nAs expected, Su Ping said with a smile, \"The first stage of the plan is almost complete. The development of the back mountain has started, covering an area of roughly twenty square kilometers.\"\nThe barren mountain at the back was no less impressive than the lake of Heart of Water, perhaps even larger.\nAfter all, considering he planned to turn it into a botanical garden, this area was actually considered small.\nAs Su Ping’s abilities grew, so did his ambitions.\nInitially, he felt the current area of Heart of Woods was sufficient. However, as his strength increased, he became less satisfied. After all, this part of Linzhou’s outskirts had never been significantly developed. Buying and developing it himself would also be a contribution to his hometown. Who knows, perhaps in the future, Linzhou would take pride in ’Heart of Wood’, using it as a landmark to attract tourists from afar?\nHowever, more advanced expansion and renovation plans would require collaboration with professionals for research; otherwise, Su Ping wasn’t that skilled in design. But no matter what the future held, the scale of his own Pet Beasts was bound to grow larger and larger.\n\"What kinds of Pet Beasts are you planning to cultivate on the back mountain? And what will be the main industry?\"\nSu Ping replied matter-of-factly, \"Plant-based Pet Beasts, preferably those that can bear fruit. We can develop a part of it as a pick-your-own orchard.\"\nDong Muyun nodded, as expected. \"So, will this barren mountain area be called ’Heart of Trees’ or ’Forest Heart’?\"\nSu Ping was stunned and looked at her as if he had seen a ghost. \"How did you know?\"\nDong Muyun rolled her eyes.\n\"Let’s call it Forest Heart! When I have time, I’ll go and carefully select the breeds for Cultivation!\"\nSu Ping nodded.\nHe hadn’t yet finalized his plans for cultivating Plant-based Pet Beasts. His main focus was on illuminating the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas and expanding his own industries, rather than making Plant-based Pet Beast Cultivation a primary project.\nAt most, they could be integrated into the Forest Flood Legion centered around Forest Wolves.\nAnd clearly, this was Dong Muyun’s main objective.\n\"Remember what I told you a while ago? Dachuan Real Estate, owned by Qin Chuan, was acquired by us. They have several plots of land here in Linzhou and its surroundings.\"\nSu Ping was taken aback for a moment, then nodded.\nHowever, he wasn’t particularly fond of real estate, even Pet Beast real estate, so he naturally hadn’t paid much attention to it.\n\"What about it?\"\n\"In the western suburbs of Linzhou, there’s a large plot of land. Decades ago, it was a medium-sized forestry farm cultivating iron birch trees for lumber.\n\"However, Linzhou’s Beast Tide at that time led to the farm’s abandonment. Over the years, the Beast Master Association reclaimed the area and incorporated it into Linzhou City.\n\"Dachuan Company, having received some early insider information, acquired this land together with the Fire King Company. Due to its history, numerous Plant-based Pet Beasts have appeared there over the years. Do you want to go take a look?\"\nHm?\nSu Ping blinked.",

      "content": "Chapter 301: Chapter 173: The Illusory Heart! Battle for the Plant-Type Wild Pet Beast!_3\nSu Ping was aware of the Beast Tide in Linzhou. It was because of that terrifyingly large-scale Beast Tide that his grandfather had sacrificed his life.\nThe Beast Tide also resulted in the western suburbs of Linzhou being deserted for so many years.\nAlthough the Beast Master Association and the Legion had completely eradicated the Beast Tide and eliminated the vast majority of wild Pet Beasts, restoring vitality to the area would clearly take time.\n\"Fire King Company? Wasn’t Da Chuan monopolizing it?\" Su Ping was surprised.\nDong Muyun smiled and said, \"If it were monopolized, it wouldn’t have been their turn. This time, the land auction was released by the Beast Master Association, and this Victory Forest Farm is the main event! Tianyun is also watching closely. A pity, TSK TSK, Dong Mutian, that wastrel...\"\nClearly, with competition among the three parties, Tianyun had wanted to monopolize it, while Da Chuan and Fire King Company chose to collaborate. Coupled with their connections to the Beast Master Association, it was only logical that they won the bid. But now Da Chuan had directly sold it all to Pingyun. After going full circle, it effectively landed back in Dong Muyun’s hands.\nTruth be told, Su Ping was indeed very interested in it.\nForest Farm!\nThe area of even a small forest farm wouldn’t be inferior to his entire cultivation base; it might even be much larger. After so many years, it was normal for the forest farm’s unique environment to have attracted some wild Plant-based Pet Beasts.\nIt’s just...\nSu Ping’s brow furrowed slightly.\nSeeming to guess Su Ping’s thoughts, Dong Muyun then smiled and said, \"Compared to the fierce beast types, Elemental Types, or even the Undead Pet Beasts—which harbor the most malice towards humans—Plant-based Pet Beasts are the mildest type. They exhibit very low aggression towards Beast Tamers, unless attacked first. Conversely, if you can persuade them, they might even willingly let you take them away! This is because, under normal circumstances, with the help of a Beast Tamer Breeder, Plant Types can grow more comfortably and contentedly. Only Beast Tamers truly understand what they like. That’s why, in the wild, some Plant-based Pet Beasts might even actively assist Beast Tamers. This was also why the Legion and the Beast Master Association hadn’t actively cleared out the wild Plant-based Pet Beasts in this forest farm.\"\nSo that’s how it is!\nDong Muyun continued, \"So, you could use your connections to bring a few Plant System Breeders. The results might be even better! That way, not too many will be snatched away from you!\"\n\"Snatched away?\" Su Ping was taken aback.\n\"People from Fire King Company will be there too. There was a written agreement stating the land could be developed jointly, or terms negotiated afterward. But as for the Plant-based Pet Beasts on the land, it’s based on individual ability! Whoever can take them away gets to keep them!\"\nDong Muyun actually felt somewhat helpless. As one of the giants in Jianghai, Fire King Company had always specialized in the Fire Element. Yet now, they were not only dabbling in real estate auctions but also had to deal with these Plant-based Pet Beasts.\nHearing this, Su Ping’s eyes narrowed slightly. Without a doubt, his interest was thoroughly piqued.\nIf both companies are going to such lengths for this forest farm, there must be something valuable there, right?\nHe looked at Dong Muyun and asked, \"When do we go?\"\n\"It’s set for tomorrow. The duration is uncertain. It was originally supposed to start three days ago, but because Da Chuan sold the company to us, it got delayed a bit.\"\n\"Good! Pick me up early tomorrow morning.\" Su Ping was rubbing his hands, eager to get started.\nAs for bringing Plant System Breeders? He knew some, but he hadn’t really given it much thought.\nWhen it came to plant synergy, weren’t the enhancements and benefits the Forest Wolf, the Wanmu Wolf, provided to Plant-based Pet Beasts far more direct than those from any Plant System Breeder?",

      "content": "Chapter 302: Chapter 174: Arrival at the Timber Farm! Lord Peach Blossom!\nEarly the next morning, a bus slowly stopped in front of the Breeder Association.\nThree figures stepped down.\nIt was none other than Su Ping, Dong Muyun, and Li Shu, who had accompanied them.\nUpon seeing the group, a voice rang out, \"It really isn’t easy to get you to ask for help!\"\nYang He smiled at Su Ping, who was opposite him. Two figures stood beside Yang He: a young woman in her late twenties, and a middle-aged, bespectacled man in his forties or fifties. At that moment, all three were smiling.\nSu Ping also chuckled. \"I had no choice, Brother Yang. You’re the only expert I know who’s even vaguely connected to Plant System Breeders...\"\nYang He hurriedly waved his hands. \"No, no, no! In front of Teacher Shangguan, I wouldn’t dare call myself an expert! Come, Su Ping, let me introduce you.\"\nHe pointed to the affable, bespectacled man in the middle and said, \"This is Teacher Shangguan Ye, a Senior Breeder specializing in tree-type Plant System, and currently the only Plant System Senior Breeder in Jianghai!\"\nA Senior Breeder! Su Ping’s eyes lit up, and he quickly extended both hands. \"Hello, Teacher Shangguan, thank you for coming despite your busy schedule. I’m sorry for making you wait.\"\nShangguan Ye just smiled, shaking his head and extending his hand. \"Xiao Yang told me about your situation. I’ve heard of that large forest farm in the Western Suburbs but never had the chance to see it myself. Now, thanks to this opportunity provided by you and Miss Dong, I can satisfy my curiosity and see it for myself. I should be the one thanking you.\"\nIt was clear that this Senior Breeder, Shangguan Ye, was cultured, courteous, and enthusiastic. Before Yang He could speak again, Shangguan Ye gestured to the woman beside him, taking her hand, and said, \"This is my wife, Meng Shan. She’s also a Plant System Breeder from Linzhou.\"\n\"Hello, Teacher Meng.\"\n\"Haha, I’ve heard President Liu mention you several times before. Now I’ve finally seen you in person, and you’re much more handsome than in the photos. Do you have a girlfriend?\"\n\"...\"\nMeng Shan was equally enthusiastic.\nAfter all, Shangguan Ye, also a Senior Breeder and Jianghai’s only Breeder specializing in rare Plant System types, had heard some rumors about matters in Linzhou, even if he didn’t know every single detail. Of course, he wasn’t aware of the recent attack. However, he did know that Su Ping was set to represent Jianghai in this year’s Breeder contest and was practically guaranteed to be promoted to Senior Specialist Breeder. This was on top of his awareness of Su Ping’s connections and resources.\nSo, when Shangguan Ye heard Yang He’s request concerning Su Ping, coupled with his genuine interest in the large forest farm in the Western Suburbs, he agreed without hesitation.\nWith the help of Shangguan Ye and Yang He, Su Ping felt even more confident.\nIndeed, even though Su Ping had his Forest Wolf Troop, which was highly compatible with Plant-based Pet Beasts, he always aimed for absolute certainty in his endeavors. After all, that forest farm was simply too large.\nDong Muyun, standing aside, watched this unfold.\nEven I might not have been able to invite such a distinguished figure as Teacher Shangguan,\nshe reflected.\nUnknowingly, Su Ping’s influence has truly grown immense.\nHowever, she quickly spoke up, \"Everyone, please get on the bus. We have a chef on board who has prepared some breakfast.\"\nNaturally, no one refused.\nBut after boarding, they were slightly surprised. Now they realized why such a large bus had been brought for just seven people, including the driver.\nIn the back of the bus, two large wolves were sprawled on the seats, craning their necks and lolling their tongues out as they tilted their heads to observe the new passengers boarding.\nOne was entirely a lush green, with an ethereal form.\nThe other was covered in branches, with horns on its head.\nThey were two massive wolf-shaped Pet Beasts.\nOne of them, an Elf Wolf, Shangguan Ye naturally recognized, as he even owned such a Pet Beast himself.\nAs for the other one, Shangguan Ye remembered the rumors he had heard. Looking at Su Ping, who sat across from him, he couldn’t resist asking, \"Su Ping, is this your...\"\nSu Ping nodded and rubbed the head of Old Sha, which had leaned forward.\nOld Sha’s ability, ’Nature’s Tongue,’ could accelerate the growth rate of Plant-based Pet Beasts, offering them unimaginable benefits. This was Su Ping’s key advantage for this undertaking.\nAfter receiving Su Ping’s affirmative response, Shangguan Ye’s eyes gleamed. He could feel the terrifying vitality emanating from this Pet Beast right in front of him.\nThis Pet Beast is pure Wood Element!\nShangguan Ye thought. Although he was a Plant Type Breeder and owned an Elf Wolf himself, he knew that some animal-type Pet Beasts could also provide significant benefits to the Plant System.\nUnfortunately, now isn’t the right time to ask about these things. The Breeder contest in Magic Capital is just a month away. All information about this Wolf Pet will naturally be revealed then. If I want to study it, or even breed one, I’ll have to wait until after the contest.\nSo, Shangguan Ye could only cast a longing, reluctant gaze at Old Sha.\nDong Muyun watched this scene with a smile, and then she said, \"The Victory Forest Farm covers over 1,000 square kilometers and is located on Niujiao Mountain, fifty-five kilometers west of Linzhou. We estimate there are over 80,000 trees and more than 2,000 Plant-based Pet Beasts remaining there!\"",

Lord Peach Blossom!_2\nHISS.\nSu Ping drew in a sharp breath.\nBefore, he had thought that his Heart of Woods had already grown quite large. Including the Heart of Water lake and the developed botanical garden, it spanned over fifty square kilometers. But now, it seemed insignificant in comparison.\nHaving eighty thousand trees was nothing special; ordinary trees had limited value. But these Plant-based Pet Beasts could nurture over two thousand individuals?\nHowever, Su Ping was somewhat astonished. \"Da Chuan and Fire King jointly bought this forest farm. What are they planning to do?\"\nAfter all, this place was already quite far from Linzhou. It was nominally a western suburb, but it was almost at the edge of Linzhou’s boundary. What was the value and meaning of developing it? Just for these Plant-based Pet Beasts? Of course, that was definitely profitable.\n\"The terrain of Bull Horn Mountain is unique, situated in a strategic location that is easy to defend and difficult to attack. With its lush forest and rocky mountains, it also connects Linzhou City with Shuhua City to the west. Supposedly, Linzhou was planning to construct a new town here before, weren’t they?\" Shangguan Ye said this.\nClearly, reaching the level of Teacher Shangguan meant having access to information not available to ordinary people.\nDong Muyun also hadn’t expected Teacher Shangguan to know about this, and she nodded. \"That’s right. Because of the previous Beast Tide, many wild Pet Beasts in the area were cleared out. The planners in Jianghai and Linzhou were thinking about developing this area, but...\"\nAt this \"but,\" Su Ping turned to look at her. She gave a slight smile. \"However, whether this project can continue is not so certain now.\"\n\"Oh?\" Evidently, Shangguan Ye was somewhat puzzled by Dong Muyun’s words.\n\"I’ve heard the Association and the planning department are discussing again. The original plan to develop westward is now shifting to the east of the city,\" Dong Muyun hinted.\nShangguan Ye and the others present were puzzled. Only Su Ping understood and felt somewhat helpless.\nCould my own ambush incident really cause a change in the city’s development policy? My bad, my bad.\nBut Su Ping also knew.\nIf this is the case, I need to quickly gather funds to continue purchasing the surrounding land plots. Of course, I have some confidence.\nAs Linzhou develops eastward, and with the continuous growth of Heart of Woods in the future, it will be more convenient and prosperous, adding a new vitality to Linzhou. A heavy responsibility and a long road lie ahead! To further expand my own Heart of Woods into a Pet Beast playground kingdom that I’ll be satisfied with, there’s still a long way to go. In order not to let down the city’s development, I also need to work hard.\nDuring the casual conversation, the coach left Linzhou’s urban area. The vehicle’s speed increased quickly, not much slower than the trains running on the railway beside the highway. The journey of a few dozen kilometers took less than half an hour, and they arrived.\nThis indeed resembled a horn-shaped hill. In front of it was a clearly abandoned manor. The marks of time were evident everywhere, with green vines entwined all around, giving it a strange sort of natural beauty.\nOf course, that’s the nice way to put it. The less favorable view, looking at this remote place, reminds me of an anime featuring a kid grim reaper I saw in my previous life—about some weekend excursions to suburban farmhouses. The kind where they wouldn’t stop until several people were dead.\nHowever, the road in front of the farmhouse was filled with many tire tracks and footprints. Clearly, many visitors had come here recently.\nIndeed, as if alerted by the sound of the coach, several figures quickly emerged from the abandoned manor. In fact, a few of them were quite familiar to Su Ping.\nFrom the coach, Su Ping could vaguely make out one of them: the middle-aged man who often fished at his Heart of Water.\nIs he rumored to be a shareholder of Fire King Company? I didn’t expect to have the chance to see him here again today!\nAs for the others, they were some of the figures he had seen from the stage at the Pingyun ribbon-cutting ceremony. Obviously, they were also some of Fire King’s top executives.\nThe doors opened, and Su Ping and the others disembarked. Leading the welcoming party was the man who had been fishing at his place just a few days ago. \"Hahaha, Student Su, good to see you’re alright!\"\nSu Ping was young. During his time at the Heart of Water lake, the group of older men hadn’t felt right addressing him as Boss Su or President Su. Instead, they mostly opted for the more affectionate \"Little Su,\" or something similar.\nSu Ping also smiled slightly. \"I didn’t expect to meet Manager Xu here again!\"\nHe glanced around. There were indeed quite a few people from Fire King Company; at a quick glance, there were easily dozens gathered here.\nAt this moment, Dong Muyun also laughed. \"Manager Xu, even though we didn’t specify a limit on the number of people, don’t you think bringing so many is a bit like bullying us?\"\nXu Li chuckled heartily. His gaze swept over the people behind Su Ping, and his pupils constricted slightly. \"Miss Dong, you even invited Teacher Shangguan. How could you not let us bring a few more people? Alas, we don’t possess the same Energy as Student Su, so we had to seek an advantage in numbers!\"\nSu Ping didn’t mind. Xu Li had been a regular customer these past few days, and Su Ping had a decent impression of him. When it came to interests, naturally, everyone wanted an advantage. But in the end, it all came down to their respective abilities.\nOne shouldn’t lose face along with the advantage, nor their composure.",

Dealing with Pet Beasts isn’t about having more people!\" Su Ping stopped Dong Muyun before he could speak again, saying with a smile.\nXu Li gave a thumbs-up. \"It has to be Classmate Su! Impressive!\"\nSu Ping glanced at him and smiled inwardly.\nImpressive? Let’s see if you’re truly impressed or just pretending to be.\nHowever, just then, from the corner of his eye, Su Ping thought he noticed a somewhat different figure. This figure was very familiar; he had spent time with this person daily in the years before. It was none other than Zhou Shuchen, who was currently standing behind Xu Li in the crowd.\nSu Ping was slightly startled but didn’t pay it much mind. After graduating, Zhou Shuchen had joined the Fire King Company, so his presence here assisting with the event, though somewhat surprising, made sense. Su Ping could even tell that Zhou Shuchen was doing well at the Fire King Company. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been involved in such a project, even just to assist.\nBut that was all there was to it.\nZhou Shuchen watched his old classmate chatting so freely with Xu Li—a man whom Zhou Shuchen himself hardly dared to greet. Having been battered by society for over six months, Zhou Shuchen wore a complicated expression. Especially after seeing Li Shu, who had followed Su Ping, the recklessness of his younger years made him realize that once you left school, some things and some people became incredibly hard to reconnect with as they once were.\nTo say there were no regrets would be a lie.\nOnly after joining the Fire King Company did Zhou Shuchen truly understand that having decent Talent and Pet Beasts was just the first step. He still had a long way to go to become a great Beast Tamer. Being a Beast Tamer wasn’t about relying on an initial Pet Beast and Talent alone. In fact, at times, these things might not be that important. Subsequent Cultivation, special Evolution, resource accumulation...\nBack then, even though he and Su Ping didn’t have a close relationship, they were still classmates.\nIf he had known earlier...\nIt was just that now certainly wasn’t the time for regrets. Su Ping would absolutely not give Zhou Shuchen the chance to regret.\nAs he entered the estate, Su Ping looked back at the vast landscape. An endless forest stretched into the distance, expansive and boundless. It contained mountains and woods, dense arrays of various wild trees, underbrush, and entwining vines.\nHowever, what he didn’t expect was that, right in front of these trees, he would see a grand sight he had never encountered in his life!\nVarious trees were rooted on the slope not far before him. There were Longevity Banyans whose crowns spread hundreds of meters wide, a single tree forming a forest of its own. There were King Gunpines rising straight into the clouds, towering two to three hundred meters high. There were Flame Morning Glories hanging from the mountainside, fiery red like blazing flames.\nAt a glance, there were nearly a thousand Plant-based Pet Beasts here.\nAre all of these Plant-based Pet Beasts gathered here?\nNearly half of the entire nursery’s Plant-based Pet Beasts convened in this place?\nSu Ping blinked. He also noticed many people in Fire King Company uniforms at the foot of the slope, handling resources as if negotiating something.\nDong Muyun frowned slightly, while the others didn’t pay much attention. Whether it was Yang He or Shangguan Ye, they knew that even if these Plant-based Pet Beasts were amenable and approachable, they would not easily agree to follow humans. Otherwise, wouldn’t the threshold for becoming a Plant System Breeder be too low for anyone to enter?\nHowever, why are there so many Plant-based Pet Beasts gathered here?\nSeemingly noticing Su Ping’s surprise, Xu Li said with a smile, \"Previously, this nursery was explored by the Legion. Even the vice president of the Jianghai Beastmaster Association personally told these Plant-based Pet Beasts that a new city was going to be developed here and that people would come to take in these wild Plant-based Pet Beasts. That’s why some of them came out of the deep forests.\"\nSu Ping nodded, yet someone else laughingly pointed out, \"It’s probably not just that. Some of these Plant-based Pet Beasts have reached the Commander Level, but a large portion are still at the ordinary and Elite Level. It’s difficult for them to understand human commands and language, so they wouldn’t migrate en masse without reason. The real reason these Plant-based Pet Beasts are gathered here is that there might be a high-level presence on this slope, right?\"\nShangguan Ye had hit the nail on the head.\nXu Li laughed awkwardly. Realizing that showing off before this person was unrealistic, he revealed the truth, \"Correct. At the top of this slope resides a Monarch Level Pet Beast of this nursery.\"\nMonarch Level!\nSu Ping’s heart skipped a beat. He had thought there was a reason the two major companies placed such importance on this, but he hadn’t expected a Monarch Level Plant-based Pet Beast to actually be occupying this place. And it hadn’t been taken away by the Legion or the Jianghai Beastmaster Association?\nIf he could get a Monarch Level Plant-based Pet Beast for himself...\nSu Ping’s eyes already shone with anticipation.\nDong Muyun, however, remained calm. \"Which Monarch Level Pet Beast is it?\"\nXu Li offered a rueful smile. He didn’t say, but others knew. Shangguan Ye continued with a smile, glancing at the countless Plant-based Pet Beasts on the hill, and added:",

Lord Peach Blossom!_4\n\"If I’m not mistaken, it must be a Pet Beast brimming with Life Force, beneficial to the growth of other Pet Beasts in the vicinity. Judging by this situation, it should be a Life Ancient Tree!\"\nLife Ancient Tree!\nSu Ping thought of Qin Xiaoxue’s.\nOf course, Qin Xiaoxue’s Life Ancient Tree was a special mutant. Among the many mutant Pet Beasts, it was also a particularly rare kind.\nThe Life Ancient Tree is a Pet Beast with Monarch Level Racial Potential. As a Life Series Pet Beast, it’s very beneficial to the surrounding plants.\nNo wonder. That Life Ancient Tree was probably relocated here after hearing the advice of the Beast Master Association. Then, the other Pet Beasts guarding the Life Ancient Tree must have followed along.\nSu Ping nodded.\nThis was good. It saved trouble.\nThe forest farm was too big—over 1,000 square kilometers, already comparable to the size of a city. Finding those thousands of Plant-based Pet Beasts inside was definitely not an easy task.\nThe Beast Master Association had laid the groundwork for Qin Chuan. It seemed they had used quite a few connections and a lot of Energy. The trouble was, they got involved in that mess, and it was as if they were making a bridal gown for someone else.\nSu Ping’s expression was calm, but his eyes had already started scanning those Plant-based Pet Beasts.\nSoon, he saw one at the very bottom of the perimeter that he fancied. It was also the most common tree-type Pet Beast. But its appearance was exceptionally unusual.\nThe tree was short and entirely pink—whether it was the flowers, fruit, or even the leaves, all were pink. Only the trunk was pitch black. This created a very special contrast.\n’Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile.’\nAn extremely rare peach tree-type Plant-based Pet Beast with a Commander Level race limit. On this hillside, he had seen only this one.\nIts Ability could release various hallucinogenic flower fragrances. The peaches it bore had an indescribably sweet floral scent and were a true luxury fruit on the market.\nAs a Plant-based Pet Beast, it could condense fruit as long as it consumed Energy. Even without any resource effects to boost it, each kilogram could cost tens of thousands, or even over a hundred thousand. A kilogram contained only two or three peaches, which truly made it a luxury fruit.\nHowever, considering it was from a Commander Level plant body and that Plant-based Pet Beasts took much more effort to restore Energy than other Pet Beasts, it made sense. Also, this ’Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile’ was extremely rare.\nIndeed, some Beast Tamers who didn’t want to venture into combat would spend a fortune to acquire such a ’Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile’ sapling. After nurturing it to maturity, selling its fruit would ensure a worry-free life, though compared to the cost, it was uncertain if they would ever earn it back in their lifetime.\nThis is it!\nSu Ping immediately locked onto his target. He didn’t need anything too powerful. However, this type of extremely rare, fruit-condensing Pet Beast was undoubtedly his best choice.\nSo, he directly went with everyone to the hillside behind the estate. San Ha and Old Sha also followed closely, arriving in front of the ’Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile’.\n\"Su Ping, do you want this ’Peach Blossom Smile’?\"\nShangguan Ye, who was nearby, also nodded. This creature was rare and held great nurturing value. Although not strong in combat, its beauty and fruit flavor were considered top-notch.\nShangguan Ye soon frowned slightly. \"However, Su Ping, this ’Peach Blossom Smile’ isn’t so easy to capture. It grows very slowly, so unless under special circumstances, it cannot have too many other plants within a certain range. It has very high survival standards.\"\nSu Ping had noticed this as well.\nIn front of this ’Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile’, several figures in Fire King Company uniforms were offering Nature Type resources, yet the ’Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile’ didn’t even show its face. In other words, it didn’t even deign to give them a proper look. It was like a proud little princess, disdainfully watching these ridiculous servants trying to curry favor with vulgar offerings.\nThe Fire King Company employees were somewhat helpless. They hadn’t expected their first target to be so difficult. They offered resources to it, and that was fine—the ’Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile’ gladly accepted them all. But when they used Telepathic Communication, telling it that if it came with them, it would have these delicious treats every day, it stopped paying attention to them. It was as if the tree’s motto was to freeload and then turn its back once it got what it wanted.\nThey knew that too. After all, being a Commander Level Plant-based Pet Beast, its intelligence was already quite remarkable; how could it be so easily deceived?\nIndeed, that was the case.\nThe ’Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile’s’ branches and leaves swayed gently. Clearly, it was quite content with the generous offering of resources it had just received.\nBut how could those resources be available every day? Did these humans think they were fooling an idiot? I, the great Peach Blossom, am not so easily deceived! Without tangible benefits, why would I possibly follow these humans? Besides, staying next to Lord Life Ancient Tree, the endless breath of Life Force it emits is the real deal. It’s just a pity there are far too many of these other plants beside Lord Life Ancient Tree. I should even let these humans take away more of those little shrubs. That way, I can enjoy Lord Life Ancient Tree’s breath of Life Force all by myself! HOORAY!\nAs expected, after seeing that the ’Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile’ ignored them, the humans didn’t persist.\nThe ’Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile’ ’hmphed’ inwardly.\nHmph. As expected, these humans are so practical and utilitarian. I, the great Peach Blossom, certainly won’t be fooled by such humans.\nHowever, what the ’Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile’ didn’t expect was that just as this group of humans walked over to those other little shrubs, a few more humans arrived.\nAnd, to be honest, the leader of this new group is quite good-looking... Of course, I have my own principles and standards! A human’s appearance obviously isn’t the deciding factor for whether I stay or leave. Besides, this human seems a bit poor, empty-handed, offering no benefits at all. That’s even less acceptable! Huh? Wait a second... What is this feeling? This human, and that wolf with him... they give off such an inviting aura.\nThe pink leaves of the ’Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile’ shook rapidly.\nHowever, this feeling soon became more and more distinct, to the point that the ’Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile’ started to feel something was very wrong:\nThis feeling... What is happening? No, this isn’t right... My body... my body is starting to feel strange! Did this human in front of me do this? How did he do it? If this continues... Damn it, I can’t control it anymore! It’s going to... come out!\nWith a faint sound, a peculiar, all-pink peach fruit appeared on the branches of the ’Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile’ with a POP, just like an inflating balloon. Then, the entire ’Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile’ seemed to wilt suddenly, as if losing all its strength.\nHowever, RUSTLING sounds came from its trunk.\nThis was the ’Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile’s’ voice! Instantly, everyone who had just started to leave turned their heads sharply back.\nAll the Beast Tamers present who possessed the Talent of ’Telepathic Communication’ understood the meaning behind this sound:\n\"RUSTLE, RUSTLE (Human, you’re amazing! Lord Peach Blossom wants to go with you...)\"",

      "content": "Chapter 306: Chapter 175: The Peach Blossom’s Gift! An Easily Lit Illustration!\n\"Lady Peach Blossom, I want to go with you...\"\nThe meaning behind this rustling sound left everyone present completely dumbfounded. Blinking, they looked at the new fruit that had just formed on the branch, unable to process what had happened.\nEspecially the people from Fire King Company, who were simply frozen in place. They then looked at Su Ping and the excitedly swaying, red-crowned Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile with great resentment.\nWhat the hell is going on here?\nThey had just offered three Elite Level resources and even used a Commander Level resource to tempt the Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile, all to no avail. This time, Fire King Company had indeed come prepared with a multitude of items, even carrying two Monarch Level resources, but those were meant for the main event! Above them loomed a Life Ancient Tree! So, for everyone involved, the resources offered for the exceedingly precious Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile were already quite remarkable. Yet, not only did it refuse to leave with Fire King Company, it didn’t even provide the slightest feedback.\nAnd now, what the hell is this?\nWas the Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile seduced by Breeder Su just standing here for such a short time?\nCould it be that in this world, some things are just this unreasonable?\nAt this moment, they had an illusion. They felt like simps constantly groveling before a goddess, offering flowers, gifts, and making grand promises about the good life they’d have if she agreed, all in a demeaning manner. The result? The so-called goddess accepted all the gifts without a word, not even leaving a single sentence. She didn’t even deign to give them a glance. Yet, this goddess, who had always been aloof, threw herself into the arms of a rich and handsome man the moment he arrived, opening her heart and even agreeing to go home with him late at night. And the rich and handsome man hadn’t done a thing! This was exactly how the people from Fire King Company felt. Bitter. Too damn bitter. Who the hell could they even complain to about this messed-up situation?\nThus, they chose to shift their gaze to other ’goddesses.’\nThis ’gold-digging’ tree simply wasn’t worth their continued emotional investment anymore.\nAt this very moment, it wasn’t just them; Xu Li, who had come along, felt the same.\nOriginally, I was confident,\nXu Li thought.\nFire King Company was far more prepared than Pingyun, which had newly taken over Da Chuan. We’d also received specific information about this forest beforehand, even sending people to scout it. The aim was to secure the rare plant-based Pet Beasts and, most importantly, the Monarch Level Life Ancient Tree born within this forest! The value of these Pet Beasts is unimaginable. Therefore, to ensure success, Fire King Company truly made a hefty investment. In my view, although Miss Dong from Pingyun and Su Ping indeed hold special statuses and have great prestige, when it comes to Pet Beasts, practical matters trump all. If the resources are sufficient, what can a few Breeders even do? In the end, the resources of this forest will still belong to Fire King.\nBut at this moment, Xu Li started to feel that something was amiss.\nThe arrival of Breeder Su, Jianghai’s only Plant System Breeder, was one thing. After all, Breeder Su is rumored to have a mysterious background, a considerable heritage, and is highly regarded by the two Chairmen. It was expected they could invite Senior Breeder Shangguan. But what is this current situation? Senior Breeder Shangguan hasn’t even made a move yet! Just by Su Ping standing in front of the Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile for a moment, this Commander Level plant-based Pet Beast has surrendered? What the hell is this all about?\nYes, at this moment, Xu Li, leading the team, and everyone from Fire King Company had only one thought.\nWhy, indeed!\nAmong those present, it seemed only a few knew why.\nShangguan Ye normally wouldn’t have known, but his understanding of plant-based Pet Beasts was exceptionally profound. So much so that if he weren’t so reluctant to handle some of the tedious matters within the association, he would have had the credentials and opportunity to be nominated as Vice Chairman of the Jianghai Association. Therefore, Shangguan Ye was almost immediately aware of it.\nAt this time, I feel an indescribable energy fluctuation emanating from that bizarre Old Wolf Su Ping is riding, gradually detaching from the nearby Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile. It was this Forest Wolf that caused it!\nShangguan Ye immediately concluded.\nBut soon after, he fell back into confusion.\nIs this the kind of ability a Commander Level Pet Beast should have? Is this creature really the Evolutionary Body of the Forest Wolf I’m familiar with? This makes no sense!\nIf Su Ping knew their thoughts, he would undoubtedly assert to them that even in the Beast Taming world, science matters. It was by using scientific methods that he had succeeded.\n\"Are you called Peach Blossom? It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Su Ping,\" Su Ping said with a beaming smile, greeting the Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile before him.\nIts branches swayed gently. Then, a huge Rouge Powder Peach, just formed by condensed energy, was delivered to Su Ping’s palm by Peach Blossom.\n\"RUSTLE RUSTLE (Human... Beast Tamer, this is for you... Lady Peach Blossom likes you very much. That feeling just now, can it come again?)\"\nSu Ping smiled slightly.\nAs expected, Old Sha’s Language of Nature skill is the best lure for plant-based Pet Beasts. It can actively help them grow. For many plant-based Pet Beasts, this is an irresistible joy. After all, it’s well-known that plant-based Pet Beasts find it hard to replenish their energy; they absorb energy slowly and grow at a sluggish pace. And every time the Language of Nature skill is used, it’s like a huge boost for them!\nHowever, he still shook his head. \"If the intervals are too short, it can be harmful to your health. Once a week is best!\"\n\"RUSTLE RUSTLE (Once a week... That’s great! Lady Peach Blossom likes that feeling...)\"\nSu Ping now somewhat understood why, even in the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, the potential of the Wanmu Wolf was so highly praised.\nIt isn’t just about their Ability and race limit, but more importantly, the Wanmu Wolf’s extremely practical and powerful Skills. I can even imagine that after the Wanmu Wolf is revealed at the Breeder Contest, the price of the Forest Wolf will likely see a significant increase.\nGrasping the Rouge Powder Peach, Su Ping didn’t think twice before biting into it. His eyes lit up.\nThe taste of this thing truly lives up to its reputation!\n\"Peach Blossom, thank you! It’s delicious, and I like it very much!\"\nEven if Pet Beasts are intelligent, most of the time, they’re much simpler than humans. You should graciously accept what’s given and let the giver see how much you like their present. This Rouge Powder Peach is a condensation of the Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile’s energy. Although called a fruit, it isn’t for reproduction or seeding but for consumption by other Living Beings.\nSo, seeing Su Ping thoroughly enjoying the peach, the Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile swayed its branches gently, clearly very pleased.\nMeanwhile, Dong Muyun had approached and motioned for Su Ping to mark the Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile with Pingyun’s emblem. After all, there were too many Pet Beasts here, and it was necessary to mark the ones they subdued.\n\"Peach Blossom, wait here for a while. Later, I’ll take you and your companions back home.\"\n\"RUSTLE RUSTLE (Okay... Alright...)\"\nAfter placing the Pingyun Company’s mark on the utterly compliant Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile, and once Li Shu had taken a few photos and completed the on-site records, Su Ping continued his search for the next ’prey.’\nHowever, as Su Ping was tirelessly searching through the wilderness, Peach Blossom’s voice sounded again, \"RUSTLE RUSTLE (Su Ping... are you the one taking us away? There are so many of us here... Lord Life Ancient Tree is on the mountaintop...)\"\nHm?\nSu Ping was taken aback.\nIt really is the Life Ancient Tree.\nBut then again, what Peach Blossom said seems to make some sense, doesn’t it? With so many plant-based Pet Beasts lingering in these hills and valleys, and with Old Sha around, the efficiency is certainly top-notch. However, Old Sha can get tired too. Using the Language of Nature skill also drains a lot of Energy. Despite bringing a good amount of Recovery Potions on this trip, my original plan was just to gather some rare and precious plant-based Pet Beasts, as a massive harvest would be somewhat challenging. But if I could directly take the Life Ancient Tree back, there’d be no need for so much trouble, would there? Peach Blossom is right—if I could persuade the Life Ancient Tree directly, wouldn’t all the other plant-based Pet Beasts just fall into my hands? Nevertheless, relying solely on Old Sha’s Ability and the Elf Wolf’s Aura to subdue a powerful being like the Life Ancient Tree clearly isn’t feasible. Of course, although I don’t know much about the Life Ancient Tree, Shangguan Ye is by my side.\nEngrossed in thought, Su Ping was completely oblivious to Xu Li and the Fire King Company members, whose eyes were twitching violently.\nAs if sensing Su Ping’s hesitation and contemplation, Peach Blossom’s branches swayed gently once again. \"RUSTLE RUSTLE (Su Ping, take this... Lord Life Ancient Tree is very fond of Lady Peach Blossom... If Lady Peach Blossom leaves with you, and since Lord Life Ancient Tree is already considering moving, it will think about it...)\"\nSu Ping blinked.\nThe other Fire King Company members, who had just provided resources to Peach Blossom, felt their hearts shatter.\nDamn it! Not only is it giving itself away, but now it’s going to follow this guy and even give away its ’patriarch’ and ’family fortune’? Who are we supposed to complain to? Is being handsome everything?\nHowever, at that moment, as Su Ping extended his hand to accept the pink petal handed over by Peach Blossom, he seemed to freeze on the spot, making no move.\nBecause just then, the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas in his soul effortlessly unfolded. The next moment, a Catalog he had never seen before slowly appeared before his eyes: the Catalog of the Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile.\nBut I never expected the Catalog of the Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile to be illuminated so easily!\nSu Ping thought.\nHowever, he was then taken aback by the feedback from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, which seemed different this time:\n\"The Catalog ’Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile’ is illuminated. Current Level: 1. Received Origin reward: The effect of the Talent ’Telepathic Communication’ has been enhanced (1/10)!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 307: Chapter 176: Talent Upgrade! The Life Ancient Tree with Withering Vitality!\nSu Ping was even prepared to comprehend a new Beast Tamer Talent.\nBut at that moment, the information fed back by the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas caught Su Ping off-guard.\nThe illumination of the Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile Catalog, the Origin reward granted by the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, wasn’t a familiar Talent? However, what was fed back seemed to be almost the same? Talent ’Telepathic Communication’ effect enhancement?\nAs a thought crossed Su Ping’s mind, this message repeated itself deep within him.\nIndeed.\nYet, Su Ping could also feel that his Ability, this special Talent of Telepathic Communication, didn’t seem to have changed much!?\nIs it because of the so-called (1/10) notation? Upgrade?\nThe meaning wasn’t difficult to understand. After all, the Catalog Level within the entire Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas could be enhanced.\nAt this moment, Su Ping recalled what his old man and Commander Zhao from the Legion had mentioned.\nBeast Tamer Talents aren’t immutable?\nIn the Dragon Nation, there might be hidden terrifying resources and treasures that could enhance Talent Levels. A Beast Tamer’s Talents are what most significantly distinguish them from other Beast Tamers. However, Beast Tamer Talents each have their effects. Some can be applied in combat, while others are used in daily Cultivation. In many cases, the Talent itself reveals a Beast Tamer’s potential in a certain direction.\nAnd now, illuminating other Catalogs within the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas could also enhance the Level of already acquired Talents?\nSu Ping blinked. Although he hadn’t obtained a new Talent, he had to admit, this was even more exciting news for him.\nSome Talents are relatively underwhelming. For example, the Rapid Recovery Skill. He currently has the Elf Wolf and countless Magic Potions. This Talent can only be used in an emergency. But if its Level could be enhanced, it would likely be a different story, right? He just didn’t know what this Telepathic Communication, this Eye of Truth, would become after their Talent Levels were enhanced.\nAt that moment, Su Ping turned his gaze back to the Plant-based Pet Beasts spread all over the mountains.\nThis is a treasure trove!\nHowever, he soon snapped back to reality and held the peach blossom bestowed by the Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile in his hand.\nSure enough, in just that short time, the people from Fire King Company had also reacted. The insight from the peach blossom had indeed jolted everyone. At this moment, the Plant-based Pet Beasts on the slope were one thing, but more importantly, there was that one Life Ancient Tree. A Monarch Level Plant-based Pet Beast could emit life essence and produce Commander-Level Peak resource materials: the Fruit of Life!\nAs long as that Life Ancient Tree was taken down, dealing with the rest of the Plant-based Pet Beasts would undoubtedly be much simpler. The Life Ancient Tree’s very existence was the biggest attraction for these Plant-based Pet Beasts.\nWith that in mind, some had already summoned flying Pet Beasts and were heading towards the very top of the Cow Horn Mountain slope.\nSu Ping didn’t have this capability. The little Paperman, Qian Yi, could fly, however. Unfortunately, the little fellow’s flimsy body clearly wasn’t capable of carrying a Beast Tamer while flying.\nBut Dong Muyun was obviously no slouch.\nFollowing a peculiar cry of \"SKREE! SKREE!\", a large, silver-white, dolphin-like fish appeared in midair.\nThe Space Fish!\nA rare Space-based Pet Beast.\nAfter receiving Su Ping’s affirmation, a spatial force enveloped everyone except Li Shu, and they instantly vanished from their original spot.\nSu Ping had experienced the sensation of spatial teleportation once before. However, it was evident that such short-distance Teleportation consumed a great deal of energy. After just one use, the silver light on the Space Fish’s body dimmed significantly.\nBut now, Su Ping finally saw that silhouette.\nIt was not a particularly large figure. Yet, when it appeared, everyone couldn’t help but direct their gaze towards it.\nSu Ping had seen a Life Ancient Tree once before. Of course, as mentioned before, Qin Xiaoxue’s Life Ancient Tree couldn’t be considered standard.\nAt this moment, this Life Ancient Tree, standing only ten meters tall with a trunk that about three people could encircle with their arms, gave him a very special feeling. In terms of size and height, the Life Ancient Tree was considerably smaller than the Longevity Banyan and the King Gunpine beside it, which completely overshadowed it. But one glance at it evoked an indescribable feeling, as if it stood at the very center of this forest. There was nothing outwardly strange about it. Yet, its yellowish-green trunk and branches, adorned with verdant leaves despite the onset of winter, perfectly showcased the tree as a vibrant life form.\nThis was the Life Ancient Tree.\nSu Ping didn’t dare to rashly activate his Eye of Truth to investigate the specifics of this Life Ancient Tree. That would be a grossly impolite act, and he was genuinely afraid it might cause the Life Ancient Tree to become dissatisfied with him. Moreover, a Monarch Level Life Ancient Tree, possibly even at the Monarch Peak, possessed wisdom no less than any human. Due to its long lifespan and the ages it had witnessed, its experience was likely even more profound.\nSure enough, as Su Ping and the others appeared before this Life Ancient Tree, a human face correspondingly emerged on its trunk. The face seemed exceedingly ancient.\nAt that moment, even Dong Muyun and Shangguan Ye beside him didn’t dare to be impudent. Together, they performed an ancient rite of respect towards this ancient Life Ancient Tree.",

      "content": "Chapter 308: Chapter 176: Talent Upgrade! The Life Ancient Tree with Withering Vitality!_2\nThe reason was very simple. At this moment, even they could sense an extremely special feeling and aura emanating from the Life Ancient Tree. This type of aura was definitely not something an ordinary Life Ancient Tree could possess. The tree’s strength had probably reached Monarch Peak.\n\"Human Beast Tamer?\"\nThe muffled voice, surprisingly, did not come through Telepathic Communication but was spoken directly: \"Beasts of the Space Element, are you the new masters of this place?\"\n\"Yes, respected Life Ancient Tree elder, I have come here to invite you to relocate to another place. Do you think that would be possible?\" Su Ping was forthright, with no intention of concealing his purpose. Since the Life Ancient Tree mentioned being informed by people from the Beast Master Association, it naturally knew the purpose of Su Ping and the others’ visit. There was no point in hiding anything now.\nAnd, obviously, the Life Ancient Tree showed no surprise, asking with interest, \"Where do you want me to go?\"\nSu Ping did not conceal anything either, replying directly, \"To my personal breeding base. My plant breeding base lacks the presence of a sage like you.\"\nBreeding base...\nThe Life Ancient Tree was slightly stunned, then smiled and said no more.\nDuring this brief exchange, people from the Fire King Company finally arrived. \"Life Ancient Tree, our Fire King Company would also like to invite you over,\" one of them said.\nThe Life Ancient Tree’s ’gaze’ shifted towards that figure, its expression calm as it ’smiled’ slightly, \"That sounds good. I’ve been here for many years, and it just so happens I want to change places.\"\nThis Life Ancient Tree did not resemble a tree so much as a kind-hearted elderly man. However, it was clear that the Life Ancient Tree had realized that the two groups present were not together. It looked again towards the Fire King Company and then at Xu Li, who had arrived late, \"And what is the place you are inviting me to?\"\n\"Respected Life Ancient Tree, it’s a newly developed plant-based Pet Beast breeding park by the Fire King Company. With your influence, we plan to build the largest plant park in Linzhou. Of course, your freedom will not be restricted, and you will instead become one of the Fire King Company’s honored guests! You will receive a salary every month. Of course, human Money is of no significance to you, but it can be exchanged for the resources you need within the Fire King Company,\" Xu Li replied with a warm smile.\nThe Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile earlier was one thing, but this Life Ancient Tree, they absolutely could not let slip away. Wild Advanced Level plant Pet Beasts are a precious resource. Most have gentle temperaments and can continuously produce a variety of resources. Although slightly inferior in combat, they are the favorite kind of Pet Beasts for Life Series Beast Tamers, especially wild ones like this.\nSo, Xu Li directly played his trump card.\nHe did not wait for the Life Ancient Tree to respond and took out two items from his Beast Taming Space. Within the verdant glow, an aura of extreme moisture was contained. Merely taking them out made the air feel moister. \"Life Ancient Tree,\" Xu Li said, \"these are gifts prepared by the Fire King Company for your move, Monarch Level resources: the Yellow Jade Gourd and the Celestial Jade Lotus Leaf.\"\nEveryone’s gaze shifted slightly to look at those two items. One was a resource treasure of wood and earth, the other of wood and water. For the Life Series Life Ancient Tree, they were clearly highly nourishing. These two items might even be able to further enhance the power of the Life Ancient Tree.\nBut the Life Ancient Tree’s ’gaze’ did not waver, and the withered face on its trunk showed no change. However, it seemed satisfied as it nodded and then, still full of interest, turned to Su Ping, \"Little fellow, it seems you haven’t prepared anything, have you?\"\nThe voice sounded amused, and Su Ping also smiled, \"I know, Life Ancient Tree elder, that you have never contacted human Beast Tamers before, and naturally you wouldn’t place much importance on these so-called resources. So, elder, wherever you wish to go, you must have other requirements. Of course, if for some reason you do need some High-level resources, as long as you speak up, I can assure you that whatever you need, I can obtain them all!\"\nNot even Dong Muyun from the Fire King Company would dare to make such a promise. But Su Ping did! He had channels both through the Breeder Association and the Legion. He could obtain anything he could name, as long as he had enough Points. Even if he didn’t, he was certain he could acquire it. Not to mention, Leng Ye’s promise was still on the table. Whatever he wanted, Leng Ye could help him obtain it, though using Leng Ye’s promise for a Monarch Level Life Ancient Tree seemed somewhat unworthy.\nXu Li, seeing the surprise on the trunk of the Life Ancient Tree, hurriedly said, \"Su Ping, you can’t just...\"\nHis words were cut off as if his throat had been seized. For in the next moment, Su Ping had taken out something truly precious from his Beast Taming Space, something he had cherished for a long time!\nUpon its appearance, the Yellow Jade Gourd and the Celestial Lotus Leaf instantly lost their luster. It was a purely emerald green stone. It was none other than the special item that Su Anyong had brought back to him, the Essence of Nature!",

The Life Ancient Tree with Withering Vitality!_3\nEmperor Level resource treasure!\nThe absolute treasure of the Wood Element Life System.\nAfter the radiance of the essence of nature bloomed, even the Life Ancient Tree, which had previously shown no emotional fluctuation, seemed slightly stunned.\nIt seemed not to have expected that this little one, who did not appear very impressive at first sight, would have such a treasure hidden on him?\nHowever, it soon regained its composure.\nBut at that moment, a voice rose again. It came from Shangguan Ye, who had been watching the Life Ancient Tree oddly ever since their arrival:\n\"Su Ping, you were right; this senior Life Ancient Tree indeed doesn’t need any resources. If I am not mistaken, your lifespan is nearing depletion, and it has also become very difficult to prolong.\"\nAs soon as these words were spoken, everyone present was stunned.\nXu Li’s face grew even more rigid.\nHe looked at the Life Ancient Tree.\nThe lifespan of Plant-based Pet Beasts is long; lasting hundreds of years is common. How could a special existence like the Life Ancient Tree die so easily?\nHowever, to his surprise, a slight smile appeared on its withered face:\n\"An impressive little fellow. You must be a Senior Breeder among human Beast Tamers who has done a lot of research on our kind, right? Indeed, I probably only have about one or two years of lifespan remaining.\"\nAt this point, the branches of the Life Ancient Tree moved slightly, revealing its somewhat decayed core and the yellowed branches and leaves in its canopy.\nIn stark contrast to what was visible from the outside, it looked much like a withered husk.\nNo one had foreseen this situation, including Su Ping.\n\"This...\"\nXu Li was somewhat dumbfounded.\nIf it only has two years left, then the value of the Life Ancient Tree will be practically zero. After all, even constructing the Fire King Company’s plant nursery base would take longer than that.\n\"Elder Life Ancient Tree, is there truly no other way to extend your life?\"\nThe Life Ancient Tree smiled and shook its head. It seemed more at peace and unconcerned than anyone else:\n\"Twenty years ago, I was seriously injured while protecting these children. Now, after so many years, it’s exceedingly difficult to use resources to extend my life, let alone evolve.\"\nIt looked at everyone, clearly sensing Xu Li’s barely concealed disappointment and Su Ping’s contemplative expression.\nSo, it continued, \"This is why, when those humans arrived, I brought the little ones willing to follow me here. In the future, I might not be able to protect them anymore.\nThis place... after all, is the wilderness. If humans are willing to take in these little ones, I can die without regrets.\"\nAs soon as these words were spoken, countless Wood Element Pet Beasts on the hillside seemed to sense something. They gently swayed their bodies, emitting a collective RUSTLE, their unique way of crying out, \"Elder Life Ancient Tree...\"\nFor a moment, a sense of melancholy filled the slope.\nIt was like the wailing of numerous orphaned creatures gathered around a kind old man they were about to lose.\nThe branches of the Life Ancient Tree also swayed gently.\nIt seemed to be responding to its children’s call.\nHowever, Xu Li, standing to the side, could only sigh helplessly in the end, \"Elder Life Ancient Tree, what a pity.\"\nIndeed, such a Monarch Pinnacle-level Plant-based Pet Beast had immeasurable value.\nBut if things were as it said, there truly was nothing to be done.\nWhether the Fire King Company could help the Life Ancient Tree extend its life was one thing; even if it were possible, the cost would likely far exceed its actual value.\nSu Ping, however, expressed no judgment, instead falling into deep thought.\nHe turned his gaze to Shangguan Ye.\nShangguan Ye also just sighed and shook his head.\nIt’s not possible? After all, his understanding of Plant-based Pet Beasts wasn’t particularly profound, and he wasn’t deeply aware of many situations.\nSo he looked at Shangguan Ye again.\nShangguan Ye then explained, \"Senior Life Ancient Tree’s root of life energy has been severed. The energy source for Plant-based Pet Beasts comes from two main places: one is through their ’Photosynthesis’ skill, absorbing sunlight, and the other is from the earth, drawing water and nutrients from the soil.\nWith its root system severed, it can no longer draw nutrients from the soil. It’s also very difficult for it to absorb energy from Resource Type items.\nNow, relying solely on its branches and leaves to gather light energy is no longer sufficient to sustain the metabolic consumption required by its Monarch Level strength.\nTo have persisted for so many years, this senior Life Ancient Tree is truly remarkable.\"\nShangguan Ye was indeed a Senior Breeder specializing in the Plant System. He had quickly explained the Life Ancient Tree’s condition; even more impressively, he had discerned so much in such a short time.\nSu Ping’s brows furrowed slightly. After nodding, he fell back into contemplation.\nHowever, just then, a rustling sound arose on the hillside.\nThe Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile, originally at the foot of the mountain, had quickly moved to their side. Its trunk glided across the ground; though extremely slow for a Commander Level Pet Beast, its speed was akin to a human running normally.\n\"RUSTLE! RUSTLE! (Wow... Elder Life Ancient Tree... What happened to you?)\"\nLooking at this little one, who resembled a princess, the Life Ancient Tree smiled helplessly and shook its head.\n\"Don’t worry, little one. Humans experience birth, aging, sickness, and death, and we are no exception. I saw just now that in the future, you won’t have to worry about any dangers in the wilderness while you’re within human Beast Tamer territory.\"",

The Life Ancient Tree with Withering Vitality!_4\nRouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile clearly had a deep emotional bond with the Life Ancient Tree. Even without a face, one could feel the little creature’s despair.\nSeemingly sensing Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile’s sorrow, the other Plant-based Pet Beasts felt the same. The massive Longevity Banyan continually shed its leaves, while the branches of the King Gunpine, towering like spears into the sky, drooped slightly. The other flowers and foliage all seemed to suddenly lose their vitality.\nAlthough Plant-based Pet Beasts are not human and lack the rich emotional spectrum of humanity, when it came to matters of life and death, especially after so many years under the Life Ancient Tree’s protection, even a stone would have been warmed. Otherwise, they would not have followed the Life Ancient Tree to this place.\nAtop the hillside, Pingyun and the people from Fire King Company seemed somewhat superfluous. Here, they seemed utterly out of place among all the Plant-based Pet Beasts present on the slope.\nHowever, no one had a solution. After all, no one had expected the final outcome to be like this.\nOnce Shangguan Ye bluntly revealed the secret of its fate, the other Plant-based Pet Beasts seemed to finally understand. They began to bid farewell to this elder, this kin who had protected them for decades.\nUnder such circumstances, attempting to subdue any of the other Plant-based Pet Beasts would be pure folly. They were in mourning. Trying to coax them away right before their eyes, even if the Life Ancient Tree agreed, would certainly not be met with any kindness from these Plant-based Pet Beasts.\nWhile Plant-based Pet Beasts are generally gentle by nature and not very aggressive towards human Beast Tamers, that doesn’t mean they lack the ability to attack. For instance, among Commander Level Pet Beasts, few could match the offensive capabilities of the Flame Morning Glory hanging from the cliff face or the King Gunpine. Even Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile had clearly lost its earlier spirit.\nDong Muyun, witnessing this scene, couldn’t help but sigh. He gently asked Su Ping, \"Shall we leave for now? In a few days, these Plant-based Pet Beasts might recover and accept the Life Ancient Tree’s words and its end. Otherwise, trying to take them away now would be impossible. Lingering here would not only be a waste of time but also make us seem out of place and rather annoying.\"\nXu Li and the others nearby obviously felt the same but had not taken any action, since Dong Muyun and his group hadn’t moved. As their eyes met, it was clear they understood each other’s intentions and were ready to leave the area surrounded by plants and head down the mountain.\nHowever, just then, Su Ping, who had been silent and lost in thought, suddenly stepped forward from the crowd. This surprised Dong Muyun, Shangguan Ye, Xu Li, and the people from Fire King Company. After a moment’s thought, he spoke, his words somewhat awkward and abrupt in the solemn atmosphere, \"Excuse me, Elder Life Ancient Tree, would you allow me and Old Sha to try and see if we could make your condition a bit better?\"\nHis voice was not loud, but all the Plant-based Pet Beasts gathered on the hillside could hear him loud and clear. At the same time, the people from Fire King Company, along with Dong Muyun and Shangguan Ye, who had all been ready to descend the mountain, suddenly froze. They stared at Su Ping, who was clearly not joking, and for a moment, they were all taken aback.",

      "content": "Chapter 311: Chapter 177 Healing! The Perfection of the Heart of Woods!\nLooking at Su Ping, who was dead serious, everyone could now tell that this human Beast Tamer didn’t seem to be joking.\nEven Shangguan Ye frowned slightly.\nWas it something he had just said that wasn’t quite appropriate?\nCurrently, the root system of the Life Ancient Tree was severed, making it difficult to draw a significant amount of energy for revival. Being able to guarantee a lifespan of another year or two already demonstrated the substantial foundation of this Life Ancient Tree. Extending its life further would be incredibly difficult. The returns would definitely not be proportional to the investment. With that kind of capital, one might almost be able to purchase some young Life Ancient Trees; it was obviously a loss-making proposition.\nHowever, at this time, the other Plant-based Pet Beasts clearly didn’t care about such concerns. This was especially true for the Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile, which had been extremely close to Su Ping before; it now swiftly swayed and \"looked\" towards him.\nFor human Beast Tamers, there could be many Life Ancient Trees. But for these little creatures, there was only one Life Ancient Tree.\nThis was also why Su Ping, despite the risk, wanted to give it a try. With Old Sha’s language of nature, Su Ping believed that even without the Life Ancient Tree, he would outcompete the Fire King Company for these rare Plant-based Pet Beasts.\nYet, witnessing this scene, Su Ping still couldn’t help himself. For these little Plant System creatures, losing the Life Ancient Tree was akin to losing a family member.\nThe other Plant-based Pet Beasts felt the same way. Even the apparently fiery Flame Morning Glory couldn’t wait to make its voice heard.\n\"PEEP PEEP PEEP! Human, if you can help the Life Ancient Tree, I am willing to leave with you!\"\n\"RUSTLE RUSTLE! And me...\"\n\"...\"\nFor a moment, they all spoke up. Su Ping didn’t respond because even he didn’t have much confidence in himself.\nInstead, the Life Ancient Tree in front of him shook its head. \"Little ones, natural essence is such a precious resource. Using it on me would be a waste. Besides, even with natural essence, sustaining my lifeforce would be extremely difficult. Even if it worked, it would at most extend my life by a few months—not worth the effort!\"\nSu Ping smiled. \"Whether it’s possible or not, we still have to try! And I’m not planning on using natural essence!\"\nThe Life Ancient Tree was slightly taken aback. It said no more, continuing to regard Su Ping with curious and interested eyes.\nThis odd young man... it had seen him interacting with the Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile on the hillside just moments before. The Life Ancient Tree found the Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile to be one of its most troublesome little ones—second only to that disobedient brat still refusing to leave the nursery. The fact that this young man had secured its direct agreement clearly indicated there was something unusual about him.\nConsidering this, the Life Ancient Tree didn’t mind letting him try. Yet, as an old tree that had come to terms with its fate, it nodded and then said, \"Alright. But, little one, if you fail, don’t feel disheartened or discouraged. And you little kids, don’t blame him. Having this kind of intention is already wonderful.\"\nClearly, the Life Ancient Tree worried that the other Plant-based Pet Beasts would blame and resent Su Ping if he failed. This concern made Su Ping feel an even stronger fondness for the Life Ancient Tree, which was like a kindly old person.\nA Life Ancient Tree like this fit perfectly with the overall style of the Heart of Wood Cultivation Base. Having a presence like the ’Sweeping Monk’ would make the construction of the botanical garden that much smoother.\nThus, under everyone’s expectant gazes, he took a deep breath and patted Old Sha’s head.\nOld Sha clearly understood some of its young master’s thoughts. Its gaze towards the Life Ancient Tree also held a touch of sympathy.\nIt had faced a similar exhaustion of its life force before and had been prepared to face the end of death. In the end, it was its young master who had pulled it back from the brink.\nNow, looking at a Pet Beast in a similar predicament, how could Old Sha not empathize? Naturally, Old Sha too wanted to assist this Life Ancient Tree.\nHence, even without Su Ping’s command, it followed him and slowly approached. The Life Ancient Tree regarded the old wolf that had come before it with curiosity, momentarily taken aback.\nAlthough it didn’t know what kind of Pet Beast this old wolf was, it could sense that the old wolf was merely a Peak Command Pet Beast. Could a Peak Command Pet Beast help it?\nClearly, the Life Ancient Tree itself had never held much hope and was now even less concerned. However, it was soon taken aback again.\nAll of a sudden, it felt an extremely unique power fluctuation emerging on its body. This power fluctuation enveloped and wrapped it, leaving it momentarily at a loss.\nEven the other spectators watched the scene without blinking. Among those present, aside from Dong Muyun, obviously no one believed Su Ping could do it.\nOnly those who understood the specific circumstances could truly comprehend the immense difficulty involved, how hard it would be to restore it.\nOnly Dong Muyun had seen this young man produce too many miracles. These miracles weren’t just one or two occurrences.",

      "content": "Chapter 312: Chapter 177 Healing! The Perfection of the Heart of Woods!_2\nDong Muyun possessed an inexplicable, almost irrational confidence in Su Ping, who was merely an elite seventh-tier Beast Tamer. It felt as if anything Su Ping claimed he could do, he absolutely could achieve.\nIn the profound silence, where all the people and Plant-based Pet Beasts were nearly motionless, everyone’s gaze was fixed on the trio at the center: a man, a wolf, and a tree. They were afraid to make the slightest sound, fearing it might disrupt the process. They could also sense a fluctuation spreading from the old wolf to the Life Ancient Tree. With this fluctuation, the Life Ancient Tree’s expression even turned grave. It didn’t continue speaking, allowing that sensation to merge with itself.\nHowever, Su Ping’s brow furrowed slightly as the fluctuation from Old Sha halted abruptly.\nWas it not working?\nIndeed, even under such circumstances and with Old Sha’s Natural Language, the decay and yellowing of the Life Ancient Tree were not alleviated; it was as if nothing had any effect on it.\nA flicker of emotion crossed the face of the Life Ancient Tree, and it said with a smile, \"Ah, this sensation! What a marvelous Pet Beast! Human Beast Tamers truly are the wisest of living beings!\n\"Any Pet Beast in your hands can display all sorts of miraculous abilities. Such wondrous Evolutionary Bodies are never seen in the wild!\n\"It has been a long time since I last felt myself growing so vigorously. It’s just a pity...\"\nThe Life Ancient Tree didn’t elaborate on what was a pity, but Su Ping knew. Natural Language could accelerate the growth of Plant-based Pet Beasts, but it couldn’t induce their recovery! Furthermore, with the Life Ancient Tree’s life force nearly extinguished, even standard healing methods were unlikely to take effect. Su Ping hadn’t even let the Elf Wolf try because he knew if it were that simple, the Life Ancient Tree wouldn’t be so desperate. In such situations, most attempts were futile. It wasn’t merely a case of treating the symptoms without curing the root cause; rather, it couldn’t even alleviate the symptoms.\nSeeing this, everyone shook their heads; even Dong Muyun frowned slightly.\nHad it failed?\nBut it made sense.\nSu Ping hadn’t truly delved into the domain of Plant-based Pet Beasts. It was normal for some deviations to occur, and Su Ping wasn’t to blame. Indeed, the Life Ancient Tree had simply delayed too long and was now at its last gasp.\nThe other Plant-based Pet Beasts also seemed to dim at once. The faint glimmer of hope that had just arisen was extinguished, replaced once more by disappointment. However, with the Life Ancient Tree’s earlier admonition, no one blamed Su Ping. They knew Su Ping was trying to help their revered Life Ancient Tree.\nYet, just when everyone else had given up, one person had not. Su Ping was never one to give up easily. Since he had stepped forward, he hadn’t truly expected the issue with the Life Ancient Tree to be resolved so easily.\nHe let out a soft breath. Everything circled back, and the responsibility once again rested upon that one skill he found most unforgettable!\nHeart of Woods!\nThis was his grandfather’s legacy. It was one of the most remarkable passive-type ordinary skills for Wood Element Pet Beasts. It was an evolution of the Heart of Elements, the primary reason the Wanmu Wolf and its other Evolutionary Bodies stood apart from others by an unimaginable margin.\nThe Heart of Woods allowed it to absorb the vitality of ordinary trees to nourish itself, drawing their strength to replenish its own. Similarly, Natural Language had a somewhat comparable effect, able to absorb the power of other Plant System life forms to give back to itself. And naturally, if it could absorb, it could also release! If it could draw power, it could also feedback power! Old Sha didn’t even need to absorb the life force and vitality from other Wood Element plants or Plant-based Pet Beasts to compensate. This was because its ’Photosynthesis + Sunlight Absorption’ ability was sufficient to replenish the energy Old Sha expended.\nAnd this was precisely what Su Ping truly wanted to attempt! Using the power of the Heart of Woods to restore other Plant-based Pet Beasts.\nUndoubtedly, this was an unprecedented attempt. And any new attempt ignited an unimaginable passion and excitement within Su Ping. Therefore, his gaze showed no trace of disappointment; in fact, as he looked at the Life Ancient Tree, his eyes held an undeniable excitement. This made even the Life Ancient Tree feel something was unusual. But it had clearly seen that this little fellow had not given up at all.\nSince he hadn’t given up, what reason did it have to abandon hope?\nSo, the face on the Life Ancient Tree nodded again. \"Little fellow,\" it said, \"if you have any other methods, please continue.\"\nOf course, he would continue.\nAlmost as soon as it finished speaking, Su Ping lightly patted Old Sha, employing a special skill that Old Sha had rarely ever used. This skill had shone brilliantly in the Legion’s grand competition, dumbfounding numerous Commanders and exceeding the imaginations of many Beast Tamers. This skill was the Wanmu Wolf’s most unique ability: Mutation: Wood Body!\nAnd at this very moment, Old Sha had already entered a state of wood transformation. Transformed into a tree, Old Sha seemed to take root in the ground, becoming indistinguishable from the other Plant-based Pet Beasts.",

The Perfection of the Heart of Woods!_3\nThe multitude of plant-based Pet Beasts nearby all seemed too stunned to react.\nHowever, Su Ping and Old Sha were unconcerned by these flickering gazes, as branches from Old Sha’s body slowly spread out to connect with the Life Ancient Tree.\nOnly then did Su Ping turn with a smile to the nearby Longevity Banyan and say, \"Esteemed Longevity Banyan, could you please move aside a little to let the sunlight shine through?\"\nThe Longevity Banyan was enormous. Though it had deliberately left some sunlight for the spot where the Life Ancient Tree stood, it was still not enough.\nOnce these words were spoken, the surrounding plant-based Pet Beasts swiftly made way, clearing a large space and exposing Su Ping and the others to direct sunlight. Su Ping nodded, pleased.\nUnder the sunlight, Old Sha’s body seemed to glow with a faint, hazy radiance. The branches connected to the Life Ancient Tree appeared to sway slightly.\nThe next moment, a tremendous wave of energy surged forth from Old Sha. With Sunlight Absorption fully activated, Old Sha, now in his woody state, seemed enveloped in a shell of sunlight, causing the rays of sunlight near Su Ping to dim slightly.\nThis is...\nShangguan Ye’s pupils contracted as he incredulously watched the Wanmu Wolf before him. At this moment, Jianghai’s sole Advanced Plant Cultivator looked at Old Sha with nothing but fervor in his eyes. This peculiar Forest Wolf Evolver was far too enigmatic—enigmatic to a degree that went beyond his expectations.\nSuch power...\nIndeed, at this very moment, the Life Ancient Tree also seemed to sense something amiss. It could feel an overwhelming life force being transferred from the strange Pet Beast before it.\nIs it trying to borrow life? But has this little fellow lost its mind? And isn’t this life force far too great?\nAt that moment, everyone could clearly see something happening on the Life Ancient Tree. Though its roots showed no signs of change, still looking decayed with no indication of recovery, atop its canopy, some peripheral withered branches and leaves were slowly regaining their green hue. While root decay was still inevitable, this replenishment of life force was enough to slightly extend the Life Ancient Tree’s lifespan.\nHowever, it seemed that wasn’t all. At that moment, the light released from Old Sha’s body seemed to become even denser. Boundless sunlight poured down, as if covering everything, yet it was all absorbed by this peculiar Pet Beast.\nWhat is this situation?\nEven Su Ping was slightly taken aback.\nOf course, Old Sha’s Sunlight Absorption and Photosynthesis were both at Perfect Level, so such a phenomenon was expected. But the problem was, Old Sha’s Heart of Woods was only at Mastery Level! Though he wanted to heal the Life Ancient Tree, Su Ping never intended to harm Old Sha in the slightest. After all, Old Sha was his true family. But at this moment, Old Sha seemed to have entered a state of reckless abandon.\nFortunately, at that critical moment, the Life Ancient Tree seemed to detect something wrong and severed its connection with Old Sha. Even so, a tenth of the Life Ancient Tree’s withered branches had recovered their lush greenery, and some of its life force had been restored.\nAlmost simultaneously, a light that wasn’t dazzling under the sunlight appeared on Old Sha’s body. Old Sha’s aura suddenly shifted.\nSu Ping seemed to realize something too and turned his gaze sharply towards Old Sha. Old Sha’s power surged skyward!\nMonarch! Is Old Sha ascending to Monarch rank?\nYet, that wasn’t what truly moved Su Ping. The Wanmu Wolf’s racial potential limit was not high enough for such an event to surprise him. What truly astonished and elated him was that Old Sha’s Heart of Woods, amidst the reverse outpouring of life force, had ascended to Perfection!\nWith this, all three Skills of the Sun Formula had reached Perfect Level!",

      "content": "Chapter 314: Chapter 178 Monarch Old Sha! The Great Harvest of the Plant Catalog!\nThis ray of light was so splendid. Under the high sun’s radiance, it was as if it were a statue frozen in time, with everything revolving within the brilliance of its glow.\nSu Ping stared blankly at the scene before him.\nAt this moment, beneath the cover of the sunlight, his body felt little warmth. All the sunlight that shone on the summit of Bull Horn Mountain seemed to be drawn toward that one power: the wood-petrified Old Sha.\nDuring this time, Su Ping and Heart of Woods had never given up on the cultivation of Old Sha’s Heart of Woods. Dozens of Forest Wolves continuously trained in Heart of Woods, linking and sharing with Old Sha. According to the connection-sharing rules of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, as long as they were of the same Evolutionary Body origin and possessed the same Skills, linkage was still possible. However, the unique Skills of the Wanmu Wolf that Old Sha possessed could not receive enhancements from the other Forest Wolves.\nIn addition to the improvements from connection sharing, Old Sha had also been consuming ’Heart of Wood’ magic potions daily like they were food. At the same time, Su Ping also tried a version of the Heart of Wood potion with added ingredients, making the medicinal properties even more potent. Since Forest Wolves could comprehend the Wood Heart Skill by consuming the Heart of Wood magic potion, naturally, after taking it multiple times, the effectiveness of the Wood Heart Skill would also correspondingly improve. Therefore, over the past half year, Old Sha’s improvements in this aspect had never ceased. Now, it had finally paid off, like the clouds parting to reveal the moon.\nLooking at this scene, Su Ping let out a long sigh of relief.\nWhile achieving Perfection in Heart of Woods didn’t necessarily mean that the Sunlight Absorption Super-Rank Skill would manifest, there was no doubt he had taken the most important step.\nA terrible majesty emanated from that figure.\nWolf King Majesty!\nThis was monarch-level majesty, and now, with Old Sha’s own Level having advanced to this stage, Wolf King Majesty truly lived up to its name.\nMajesty of a King, this Skill, truly wasn’t something an ordinary person could possess.\nSu Ping had previously speculated that Old Sha had once had an unimaginable unique encounter. In that encounter, its Sunlight Absorption Skill reached Perfection, breaking through its race limit. In the process, it also obtained this extremely special Skill, ’Wolf King Majesty’.\nPreviously, Su Ping hadn’t paid it much mind. But now that Old Sha had advanced to Monarch, Wolf King Majesty was finally unleashed in its entirety.\nSan Ha, the Elf Wolf, was whimpering softly, as if worshipping its king. At the same time, countless Plant-based Pet Beasts around them, after this peculiar Wolf King’s promotion, could feel the surging vitality emanating from it. It was as if Old Sha were one of their own, making them instinctively want to draw near and approach it.\nAbout ten minutes passed. Old Sha reopened its eyes, having already reverted to its beast form. The light gradually faded. When Old Sha reappeared, there were no particularly special changes.\nPerhaps the Y-shaped horns on its head had become a more vibrant green, and the forest-like branches and leaves on its body more dense.\nBut Su Ping could see from the Eye of Truth’s feedback that Old Sha was now a solid First Stage Monarch. This proved it had succeeded.\nThis old Forest Wolf, merely a Commander First Stage half a year ago, had completed its most magnificent metamorphosis in this half-year period. In just half a year, it had risen to Monarch Level!\nThe difference between the Monarch Level and the Commander Level was like heaven and earth. This was evident in the difficulty for a Beast Tamer to rise from Commander to Monarch—it was extremely high. Pet Beasts possessed the Ability of Evolution, so in many cases, it wasn’t too much of a concern. However, promotion wasn’t something that could be achieved casually either. To Su Ping’s surprise, Old Sha had indeed ’casually’ completed its advancement. A difference of one Realm, yet the disparity was enormous.\nAnd now, his Heart of Woods endeavor finally possessed its own Monarch Level combat power!\nAlthough, given his connections and status in Linzhou, it was unlikely anyone lacking judgment would come looking for trouble. However, in this era of extraordinary Controlling Beasts, nothing was more reliable than genuine, tangible strength.\nIndeed, good deeds do pay off.\nAlthough Su Ping also knew this was Old Sha’s own accumulation, that Old Sha itself had trained to a critical point. However, without such an opportunity, it might still have required some more time.\nAt this time, Su Ping truly didn’t have the spare attention to continue observing the Life Ancient Tree’s situation; all his thoughts were on Old Sha. The sunlight returned to normal. Old Sha didn’t continue to absorb sunlight, converting it into the Energy of Heart of Woods, and transferring it to the Life Ancient Tree.\nSu Ping could see that, for now, there was nothing abnormal about Old Sha. However, he wasn’t anxious; this wasn’t the place for investigation anyway.\nSu Ping exhaled slowly.\nMoreover, back then, Er Zhuang was able to unleash such terrifying power because of the complete consistency of those three Skills. There was also another condition that Old Sha lacked: mastering the Skill ’Blinding Technique’. This Skill was the Wanmu Wolf’s method for absorbing and utilizing sunlight. It was also preliminary proof of mastering Light Power. As a Racial Skill of the Wanmu Wolf, mastering this Skill wasn’t considered troublesome. It could even be mastered during natural growth and improvement, but Su Ping felt he couldn’t wait that long.",

He had already acquired his own insights into the cultivation of Pet Beasts.\nMastery of such skills fell under the Wanmu Wolf’s Racial Skills; corresponding resources could be used to accelerate its growth.\nAs for the Blinding Technique, it was an energy release of sunlight power. Therefore, by replenishing solar energy to a certain limit, one would naturally comprehend it.\nThinking of this, Su Ping obviously didn’t want to stay here any longer. He spoke to Dong Muyun, who was beside him, saying,\n\"After we go back, prepare a large quantity of Sunspring Water for me.\"\nHe still had some Sun Crystals in his possession, scrounged from the legion. The Breeder Association had also given him two more, so he definitely wasn’t lacking in them.\nDong Muyun gave him a somewhat surprised look but did not ask anything.\nAt this moment, Su Ping represented miracles themselves.\nBecause not only him, but everyone around—even the Life Ancient Tree itself—had never expected that it could possibly regain vitality one day.\nEven if such vitality only extended its life a little.\nHowever, this was the release of someone else’s skills, not the consumption of precious resources.\nIf possible, was there really a chance to continue living?\nEven a lowly insect clings to life. Being resigned to death does not mean one desires it.\nIf there was a chance to continue living, what living being would want to die without reason?\nWithout a doubt, the Life Ancient Tree felt the same. It silently observed the Old Wolf still experiencing a surge of power and the Beast Tamer who had lowered his head, lost in contemplation. Eventually, the face on its bark finally spoke:\n\"Little fellow, what kind of Pet Beast is this?\"\nSu Ping then came back to his senses and smiled.\n\"The Wanmu Wolf. Heart of Woods... it’s one of the family members from my cultivation base.\"\n\"Family...\"\nThe Old Tree chewed on these words and then smiled faintly. \"Little fellow, may I visit your home? If you don’t mind the short time I have left.\"\nSu Ping smiled broadly.\n\"Of course, don’t worry. With me here, I definitely won’t let you die so easily.\"\nThe Old Tree hadn’t really believed these words before. It knew its own condition better than anyone else. Whether it could continue to live was unclear.\nBut it had to be said, this strange tree wolf was just too bizarre.\nThe Beast Tamer who had cultivated such an odd Pet Beast was undoubtedly even more extraordinary.\nJust as the Old Tree had previously mused, only under the care of human Beast Tamers would such odd, yet marvelously magical, Pet Beasts be born and come into existence.\nSo, it was willing to believe in this little fellow.\nXu Li and the others looked on with complex expressions.\nThis time, they were truly convinced.\nThey wished they could thump their chests with such certainty and take this old Life Ancient Tree away too.\nIf they could take it, not to mention the numerous low-level, mass-produced varieties of plant-based Pet Beasts, acquiring the surrounding rare and valuable plant-based Pet Beasts would certainly be no problem.\nIf they could take all of them back to Fire King Company, it would undoubtedly represent an unimaginable wealth.\nBut how could they make such a promise?\nDuring the ’fishing’—when Xu Li had been subtly probing—he had heard some things about the background and miraculous deeds of the young owner of Heart of Woods.\nBut he had never seen it with his own eyes.\nAnd now, he had finally witnessed it.\nIt was no wonder such a young person was held in such high regard by Queen Dong and Presidents Qin Liu. Impressive indeed.\nHowever, neither Fire King Company nor Xu Li himself had much of a relationship with this young man. Otherwise, establishing a good relationship with him would undoubtedly bring all benefits and no drawbacks.\nSuddenly, an idea flashed through Xu Li’s mind.\nHe recalled someone from the company mentioning that among this year’s interns at Fire King Company, there seemed to be a classmate of this young owner—the same lad who had come along to do menial tasks on this trip.\nCould he perhaps foster a closer connection through this contact?\nWhile Xu Li from Fire King Company was still mulling things over, he saw that the Life Ancient Tree had agreed to relocate. The other plant-based Pet Beasts, which were to accompany it to Su Ping’s cultivation base, had already gathered around again.\nThey began chattering again with renewed vigor:\n\"RUSTLE RUSTLE! (Tree Grandfather, how are you doing?)\"\n\"BLUB BLUB BLUB! (Life Ancient Tree, Your life force...)\"\n\"[...]\"\nSu Ping also looked towards the Life Ancient Tree. He could naturally see its condition as well.\nThe problem with the Life Ancient Tree was not resolved.\nThe decayed roots within its body were still not showing any signs of improvement.\nHowever, quite a few of the withered branches and leaves within the canopy had been restored.\nAlthough it was still only a temporary solution, not addressing the root cause, the restored vitality had nourished it considerably. Thus, it could extend its lifespan for a while longer.\nIndeed, as expected, the Life Ancient Tree continued with a slight smile,\n\"Thank you to this human Beast Tamer’s Pet Beast. I might be able to live about five more months.\"\nAn extension of half a year was indeed not much.\nBut one must realize, this was only after a single treatment by Old Sha.\nUpon hearing this, the other plant-based Pet Beasts couldn’t help but rustle as they turned their gaze towards Su Ping.\nNearby, Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile made a sound,\n\"RUSTLE RUSTLE! (It’s... him. His name is Su Ping. Lord Peach Blossom knows him...)\"\nObviously.\nMost of the other plant-based Pet Beasts had witnessed Su Ping winning Lord Peach Blossom’s ’affection’ on the hillside earlier.\nAnd now that Su Ping had once again helped treat their Life Ancient Tree, there was no doubt. At this very moment, all the sentient, rare plant-based Pet Beasts regarded Su Ping with a ’gaze’ that was vastly different.\nThen, as expected, the Longevity Banyan, whose huge branch canopy was closest, rustled as it spoke,\n\"RUSTLE RUSTLE! (Human, you were able to help the Life Ancient Tree, and since the Life Ancient Tree is willing to leave with you, I’m also willing to go with you.)\"\nThe Longevity Banyan’s stance did not surprise anyone; in fact, it was entirely expected.\nHowever, what also didn’t surprise anyone was the Life Ancient Tree’s unimaginable rallying power.\nFollowing the Longevity Banyan, the towering King Gunpine, its form reaching into the clouds, also made its voice heard,\n\"RUSTLE RUSTLE! (I will always follow the Life Ancient Tree...)\"\n\"BLUB BLUB BLUB! (Wherever the Life Ancient Tree goes, I will go. Thank you, human Beast Tamer...)\"\n\"...\"\n\"RUSTLE RUSTLE! (Right! Lord Peach Blossom... indeed saw at first glance that Su Ping could help the Life Ancient Tree! That’s... that’s why I wanted to go!)\"\nAmidst the chorus of voices, Rouge Powder Peach Blossom Smile chimed in, adding its own reason for having ’surrendered’ so early.\nSu Ping chuckled, not minding.\nHowever, what happened next was something he couldn’t just ignore.\nBecause at that moment, his Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, which had just quieted down, suddenly and swiftly unfurled once more from within his soul.\nYes, incredibly swiftly!\nPage after page of the Catalog appeared in the depths of Su Ping’s mind.\nIf illuminating a Catalog page before was like drawing a single card, then this time, it was akin to performing a ten-pull!\nThe Catalog pages unfurling from deep within his soul were so numerous it was dazzling.\n[Catalog ’Longevity Banyan’ illuminated, Current Level: 1. Origin Reward: Talent ’Telepathic Communication’ effect enhancement (2/10)!]\n[Catalog ’King Gunpine’ illuminated, Current Level: 1. Origin Reward: Talent ’Telepathic Communication’ effect enhancement (3/10)!]\n[Catalog ’Laurel Tree’ illuminated, Current Level: 1. Origin Reward: Talent ’Telepathic Communication’ effect enhancement (4/10)!]\n[...]\n[Catalog ’Flame Morning Glory’ illuminated, Current Level: 1. Origin Reward: Talent ’Call for Rain’!]\n[Catalog ’Sky-reaching Vine’ illuminated, Current Level: 1. Origin Reward: Talent ’Call for Rain’ effect enhancement (1/20)!]",

      "content": "Chapter 316: Chapter 179: Talent Upgrade Successful! Sky-reaching Vine!\nWas it really a ten-pull summon?\nSu Ping blinked. This time, he even felt a headache coming on.\nThis was because the intimacy levels with the plant-type Pet Beasts whose Catalogs were being illuminated had reached the standard.\nThe illuminated Catalog affected his Spirit directly.\nHis Telepathic Communication Talent was enhanced, and he gained the new Talent ’Rain Prayer’. Such rapid improvement made it somewhat difficult for Su Ping to accept.\nOf course, difficulty in accepting it didn’t mean he was unwilling to accept it.\nIf a mere headache could grant such improvement, then Su Ping would say, please continue, whip me harder.\nHe rubbed his throbbing temples, yet still felt a tinge of unsatisfaction.\nWhat a pity.\nThose Low-level Pet Beasts below Commander Level, being plant-type Pet Beasts, did not possess strong intelligence or understanding. They only followed passively and naturally couldn’t quite grasp what was happening.\nTherefore, the difficulty in illuminating those Pet Beasts’ Catalogs was likely to be much more challenging than for the others.\nHowever, Su Ping was satisfied.\nBecause at this very moment, he had not only acquired the brand-new Talent ’Rain Prayer.’\nWhile these plant-type Catalogs were being illuminated, his ’Telepathic Communication’ Talent indeed reached its full potential.\nIt must be said, thanks are due to the Life Ancient Tree.\nIt was not just because of these Life Ancient Trees that a Catalog could be illuminated.\nMore importantly, there was a special notification from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas:\n[Catalog ’Life Ancient Tree’ illuminated, Current Level: 1, received Origin reward: Talent ’Telepathic Communication’ effect increased (11/10)!]\n[Talent ’Telepathic Communication’ upgraded to ’Psychic Communication’]\nCompared to the illumination of other Catalogs, I wonder if it’s because of the Life Ancient Tree’s higher race Level that it directly resulted in a three-point increase in effect!\nIt was precisely because of this that after the Catalogs of ten plant-type Pet Beasts were illuminated, his Telepathic Communication Talent reached its full potential!\nSu Ping closed his eyes, sensing the Origin feedback from the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas:\n[Rain Prayer: Can use spiritual power to cause localized rainfall! Moistens plant-type Pet Beasts, and at the same time, amplifies the concentration of Water Element.]\nHmm?\nSu Ping’s eyes lit up.\nThough it was somewhat abstract to receive such a Water Element Talent from illuminating the Catalog of a clearly Fire Element Pet Beast like the Flame Morning Glory.\nBut it had to be said, this Talent was truly useful.\nMoreover, it was critical in battle.\nEven though he didn’t have any Water Element Pet Beasts.\nThinking of this, Su Ping fell silent.\nThinking of those cute plant-type Pet Beasts and then those damn annoying silverfin fish, Su Ping became infuriated.\nHe decided to refocus his attention on the change in another Talent!\nThe elevation in Talent Level was something Su Ping had wanted to understand for a while.\nBut he never had the chance.\nAnd such information was not taught at basic Beast Tamer schools either.\nNow, with the help of the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas, he had finally completed this Talent Skill upgrade.\n[Psychic Communication: Can use the power of the Spirit to fully understand others’ intentions, and without speaking out loud, allow other Living Beings to hear one’s voice! It also has a certain bewitching effect.]\nIt was still very plain; even fundamentally, there wasn’t much change in the Talent upgrade.\nIf it weren’t for that last sentence, there might hardly be any change.\nAt best, an additional ’sound transmission’ effect was added.\nAlthough, this effect was also quite significant.\nSu Ping’s registered Talent was ’Pet Beast Home’; he didn’t inherently possess Telepathic Communication.\nOften, when he rushed to communicate with his Pet Beasts, it was indeed easy to give away his position. Silent communication would indeed save him from a lot of trouble.\nBut that explanation at the end added quite a bit of color to this Psychic Communication.\nOf course, Su Ping absolutely did not approve of the term ’bewitching.’\nFor a righteous Breeder, isn’t educating and influencing far superior to bewitching?\nIt seemed as if his thoughts had willed it; the final word in the Myriad Spirit Beast Atlas’s feedback for the Psychic Communication Talent actually changed to ’influencing.’\nThis finally made Su Ping nod in satisfaction.\nVery good.\nThe effect of the Talent upgrade is excellent!\nSuch improvement was exactly what could truly bring out a Beast Tamer’s Talented Ability.\nIt just remained to be seen if the enhancement effect of Telepathic Communication was like this, then what about the other Talents, like the most versatile Eye of Truth?\nBy the way, why did all the Talents enhanced in these plant-type Catalogs turn out to be Telepathic Communication?\nWhat he really wanted to enhance was indeed the Eye of Truth.\nThe Ability of the Eye of Truth was too universal.\nNevertheless, Su Ping reopened his eyes. He instinctively glanced over, confirming with each illuminated Catalog one by one.\nBut soon, Su Ping was slightly startled again.\nThe Flame Morning Glory and King Gunpine were naturally present.\nThe others, like the Laurel Tree and the Blade Ginkgo, which were relatively silent, were all there.\nBut, he looked all over the hillside and couldn’t spot the Sky-reaching Vine that was the last to be illuminated in the Catalog.\nIn the Catalog, this was a very common vine.\nLush green, at first glance, it even looked a bit like the ’Vine Strangling’ Skill summoned by the Forest Wolf.\nBut its body was extremely long.\nIt belonged to the same category as extremely rare Pet Beasts.\nHowever, if such a special vine Pet Beast were present here, Su Ping should have seen it.",

Sky-reaching Vine!_2\nHe shook his head and paid it no mind.\nOpening his sparkling eyes, he looked at the Life Ancient Tree and all the beings present with a smile:\n\"So, seniors, when do you plan to depart?\"\nHe had to get them secured.\nWithout moving them to his own place, Su Ping couldn’t feel at ease.\nThe Life Ancient Tree naturally understood this and chuckled, \"I brought them here because I’m ready to leave. There’s nothing more to prepare; we can go at any time!\"\nDong Muyun’s eyes also brightened. \"I’ll send someone to drive over right away!\"\nThe plant-based Pet Beasts before them were of such a high level that they couldn’t be stored in the Beast Taming Space. Transporting wild Pet Beasts had always been a hassle. Ordinary spatial storage couldn’t hold living Pet Beasts. In this respect, one could see that Su Ping’s Pet Beast Home Talent wasn’t bad at all. Unfortunately, its Level wasn’t high enough.\nOther matters were easier to handle. Su Ping looked at the King Gunpine and the Longevity Banyan. The Longevity Banyan’s canopy spanned over a hundred meters, forming a forest by itself. He scratched his head. Fortunately, it turned out Su Ping didn’t understand them well enough. The Longevity Banyan’s body could actually be split apart, and the slender King Gunpine could shrink down to just twenty or thirty meters. Pet Beasts capable of reaching Commander-Level Peak indeed possessed abilities beyond ordinary Pet Beasts.\nWhile Dong Muyun went aside to make arrangements, Xu Li thought for a moment, then walked over with a helpless expression, saying, \"Su Ping, can we discuss this? Could you spare some of the plant-based Pet Beasts?\"\nXu Li felt truly helpless.\nHe had anticipated this kid’s cunning, but he hadn’t expected it to reach this extent. Although he hadn’t truly expected to win the competition for the plant-based Pet Beasts, he hadn’t foreseen such an outcome.\nAll the high-end, rare plant-based Pet Beasts were taken by this brat? Then why the hell did our Fire King Company spend so much money to buy this huge piece of land?\nNow, the development trends at the Beast Master Association were shifting again, and they hadn’t managed to acquire any plant-based Pet Beasts. This business venture was a total loss, a complete write-off. At this point, he could only approach Su Ping and try to negotiate, to see if anything could be salvaged.\nUnfortunately, Su Ping shook his head. \"Mr. Xu, as you can see, it’s not that I don’t want to help you. These Pet Beasts appear to be coming with me, but it’s actually out of respect for the Life Ancient Tree. How can I help you? We can’t just force them away, can we?\"\nThat was indeed true.\nSo many plant-based Pet Beasts... Although raising them would incur costs, the value of plant-based Pet Beasts lay in their extremely low breeding costs compared to other Pet Beasts. This made them incredibly cost-effective. The sheer number of these Pet Beasts represented an unimaginable value. Unless he, Xu Li, was Su Ping’s most favored son, there was no way Su Ping would agree.\n\"Sigh...\" Xu Li sighed.\nHe knew it wasn’t just about the rare plant-based Pet Beasts on the hillside. Even obtaining the ordinary, Elite Level ones below would likely be difficult. Once the Life Ancient Tree spoke, those Pet Beasts would undoubtedly leave obediently with it.\nAround a thousand plant-based Pet Beasts!\nAlthough these low-level plant-based Pet Beasts were mostly of common, repetitive species, their variety was still excellent! Those willing to accompany the Life Ancient Tree were primarily plant-based Pet Beasts that weren’t aggressive and weren’t skilled in combat. Such Pet Beasts usually shared a common trait: most of them possessed agricultural value. For example, they could produce resources—their fruits, leaves, or even branches all had various useful effects. For a company, these types were the most precious.\nWhat a pity.\nXu Li shot Su Ping a resentful glance. Just then, the Life Ancient Tree, having overheard their conversation, chuckled. \"In this vast forest farm, there are still some ’children’ who don’t wish to be with me. Among them is a rather naughty and rebellious one. You can try to find it; you might be able to take some from the forest farm with its permission.\"\nXu Li’s eyes lit up slightly. He bowed to the Monarch Peak Life Ancient Tree.\nAlthough searching Bullhorn Mountain within the forest farm would be quite arduous, it was far better than returning empty-handed.\nSu Ping, however, was slightly taken aback. \"Elder Life Ancient Tree, is there another Advanced Pet Beast in this forest farm?\"\nThe Life Ancient Tree nodded, then sighed like an elderly human. \"That child is stubborn. It always felt I no longer needed to protect them and even wanted to protect us. It’s also the only little one who knew of my condition, which is why it was unwilling to come with me. It wanted to stay here, to accompany me and protect the other young ones.\"\nHearing the Life Ancient Tree’s words, Su Ping couldn’t help but picture a headstrong young one—appearing rebellious and dismissive of protection, yet deeply caring for its family and secretly wanting to shield them all. Although Pet Beasts were plant lifeforms, once they developed emotional intelligence and self-awareness, they became increasingly similar to humans.\nSo, Su Ping smiled. But soon after, he was suddenly taken aback. \"Elder, the one you’re referring to... could it be the Sky-reaching Vine?\"\nThat was the only Pet Beast listed in the Catalog that he hadn’t seen on the hillside. However, for it to be aware of the situation here, it was very likely a Commander Level or higher Pet Beast.",
