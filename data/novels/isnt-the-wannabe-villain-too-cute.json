    "summary": "Being surrounded by people and receiving praises over the thing which I felt natural to do, wasn't something that could excite me.Since childhood, I wasn't able to find anything which could heal my boredom and understand how much it takes to be in such a center of attraction.But one day I finally found a person who was an exception to this world.From a general perspective, he was an arrogant noble who taunted women and made vulgar comments about others. A person whome you feel justified in hating.But strangely I was able to see how he was forcing himself to do such a thing in front of all. His shaky hands and fake pride were clearly seen from the way I looked at himMaybe it was the start of my first entertainment which eventually turned into something more.Something which I hadn't experienced before.Something which people regard as love..._._Synopsis from MC pov:-This main heroine is becoming problematic day by day.Since I was reincarnated here and received the villain system I just wanted to fulfill the thing which the system required to fulfill my sole wish.My only desire for which I could even give up my life for...But this main heroine isn't acting the way  I have read in my previous life.Why she is leaving the hero's invitation and joining my party under all those heavy gazes.Why the heck are you asking me on a date when the hero is watching you with such pitiful eyes.Why the fuck you are kissing me in front of the whole nation ...are you nuts!!!This is my story as a villain, which this bothersome heroine is doing her all to destroy.___________...____________A/N:- Hello.This work is something I have been thinking since so long that I had nearly forgotten...The MC would be a little weak-willed due to his past and present life but we will have character development.There would be multi POVs but I will mainly focus on Mc's and FL's pov.There would be romance and drama at the start but I will add action and op moments too, later in the story.At last, I just hope you guys like my work, Sayonara~",

      "content": "**SLAP**\nThe sound of flesh hitting flesh resonated in the whole hall pausing everyone from whatever they were doing.\nThe music was also halted by the choir as the slapping sound was enough to throw them into a startling state.\nI was standing some feet away from the main scene with a glass of fruit beer in my hand with some of my classmates beside me.\nUnlike me, they had their mouth covered with their hand in astonishment with visible amusement rising in their expectancy.\nThe whole hall was now looking at the pair of people who arose such commotion and naturally were in the center of all attraction.\nThe girl who just raised her hand and slapped the person in front was one of my classmates and training partners, Lilia Von Verlin. Daughter of Viscount Verlin.\nThe person she slapped was her fiancè and the person I was genuinely interested in for the first in my whole life.\nAustin Wright.\nThe reason she slapped him was clear as day for me.\nAustin came alone for the ball and when he saw Lilia walking around with another man whome I know too very well, Austin just went toward them and started shouting some insults at the guy who mostly has stolen Austin's fiancè.\n\"On the name of my father, I, Lilia Von Verlin from this very moment call off our engagement. I have already told my father about it so don't worry about the compensation. Now get lost from here and don't show that face of yours ever again!!.\"\nWell, now that mostly changed into completely.\nThe man Lilia sided in the ball was another classmate of mine, Kyouki Sudou.\nIn this whole scenario, he was neutral except for the fact that he encouraged Lilia to take this step just some moments ago.\nTo be honest, it was a natural thing to happen in the count of everything Austin was partaking in this whole half-year.\nThe way he acts and taunts Kyouki, the favorite of all humanity, and the way he bad mouths women around him, which unsurprisingly, includes me too, I think he was lucky to still be attending this school. Well, being a Count's son must be helping him.\nEvery person inside the hall seemed to sigh or deliver the same kind of expression as in to show how satisfied they were with this conclusion.\nI should also have felt something like that toward the person who has called me a slut, whore, and whatnot this past half a year.\nBut looking at his fallen head which he never held back up since the moment he was slapped, I was somewhat anxious.\nThere could be any two reactions a person who's self-obsessed such as Austin, could give upon being shamed like this in the middle of the whole crowd.\nFirst, whether he would slap her back by saying some other vulgar words and reject the annulment entirely.\nSecond, he would threaten her in the name of his father and discard the situation by backing off arrogantly.\nBut he did none of what I thought.\nHe just hung his head low and turned on his heels. Under the mocking gaze of everyone, he started walking silently and soon disappeared from the ceremonial mall.\nIt just felt like he was tasked to do something like this...\nBut I wasn't sure who in the world would ever want to be treated like this or get slapped in front of those many gazes.\nEven though I don't care about people's perceptions of me, I don't think I could ever tolerate such humiliation at all.\nHowever he behaved, whatever he did, he still was in the end a proud  son of a Count.\n'I have to talk to him...'\nBefore I could think anything further, my feet were already on a move toward the direction where Austin just left.\nI only walked about two steps when someone called for me.\n\"Luna? Where are you going ?\"\nIt was my classmate and the person who arose that uproar indirectly some moments ago.\nSmiling at me he asked casually as I felt some pair of daggers directed in my direction.\nIt wasn't tough to tell who those women were as I was acquainted with them but in all honesty, I didn't have a single piece of care for their envy toward me.\nHeck, I didn't even know why they had to envy me when I was not into their favourite man at all.\nBut arising such an argument right now wasnt something I wanted to bother myself so I just made a plain excuse.\n\"I don't feel good, so I am going back to my dorm.\"\nIt was the best way to escape a scene that despite being generic, I use every time I wanted to escape something weary.\n\"Oh is that so. Then let me accompany you.\"\nBut Kyouki was Kyouki. He had to play the good guy all the time.\nI immediately shook my head with my fake smile slowly dropping in annoyance.\n\"It's okay, Kyouki-kun. I will be fine by myself.\"\nI didn't stand there to hear Kyouki's exclamation or his harem's curse for how mean a woman I was.\nI just couldn't stand those guys.\nWalking out of the hall was also prolonged because of the number of people who greeted me on the way.\nMy position in the academy was only below one and above all.\nNaturally being called the Saint of humanity didn't feel much good to hear but there wasn't anything I could do.\nSince I was proficient with healing magic and was filling the gap in the hero's party, people named me such.\nNot only that. From the general mentality, if I was in a party of women with a sole man named Kyouki, people started believing I would be his first wife or sort.\nEven though I denied it a couple of times, the women beside me in the party thinks me as their rival and always said something, 'I will not lose to you even Kyouki-kun never look at me, or something along those lines.\nI feel so irritated when the whole world tries to frame that man who doesn't even could discern that the women around him, love him madly.\nI mean even a mindless creature would start reacting if those many beautiful women fawning over them, yet he sees those gestures as merely a sign of their friendly behavior.\n'Ah...I seriously have to leave his party as soon as possible.'\nShaking off my useless thought about myself I walked out of the hall and entered the garden which was just after the main entrance of the ceremonial block.\nThe night had fallen with nocturnal creatures buzzing in the background.\nI knew even in this peaceful silence it would take me time to find Austin so I just used [Mana Detection], and immediately pinpointed him.\nI knelt down and after clipping off my sandals which have given me quite love bites around my ankle, I started walking toward him.\nHe wasn't far away so it didn't take me more than 5 minutes to reach a distance where I could see his figure.\nI didn't advance more than necessary and hiding behind a tree I concentrated mana on my optic nerves to see what he was doing.\nAs I drew my eyes closer his image become more vivid.\nHe was currently sitting on a bench with his both legs curled up with his face being supported by his knees.\nHe had a blue kind of rectangular slim marble-like thing in hand which had two black circles drawn on its back. The strange thing was illuminating Austin's face with vibrant blue light.\nBut still, that weird illumination didn't make me startle this much, as something else did.\nAustin's eyes which I have often seen filled with arrogance and pride were devoid of any such sins.\nHis pair of olive green eyes were now relaxed to the point where I felt myself lost in them. There was a glint of loneliness with love filled in those eyes.\nHis all-time smug face carried only a gentle smile which made me realize that this person could make such an expression too.\nI was stunned by such a sight after so long.\nNo, maybe this was the first time when I felt someone's expression exhilarating my emotions to this extent.\nCalming my nerves I exhaled deeply.\nIt wasn't how I usually behaved but strangely I didn't hate it. More like I felt natural in this last moment.\nNow the thing I wanted to know the most was the content which that blue stone was displaying, which drew out such an expression from the famous good-for-nothing noble.\nI erased my mana and used [Camouflage] before I walked toward him silently.\nThis skill of mine was a secret which I and only my grandma knew about .\nI have used this spell a couple of times for ambush and when I wanted to study in the library for whole night, but this was my first time using it for something like this.\nUsing it to spy on a man whom I felt interesting ...would be suitable I guess.\nBeing aware of the path I was walking upon I made way toward the bench on which Austin was sitting before I took the position just behind him.\nLeaning my head slightly I finally was able to the see the source of such weird illumination. And when I finally did see the content, my eyes went wide in disbelief.....",

      "content": "\"How many villain points do I need for this week, system?\"\n[Ding! The host requires 200 more points to gain the weekly reward]\nSighing I leaned back on my chair while thinking of the thing I can do to gain these 200 points.\n'I guess today's ball will do the work'.\nStaring at the image in the mirror, I was greeted by a handsome face that in originality was far better than my last life's.\nStaring at nothing particular I was drowned in the memories of the time I have spent in this world up until now.\n15 years ago I died in my last life and was reborn here, as the minor villain of a famous manga I have read in my previous life.\nAt the start when I identified myself, I was somewhat downhearted as I have seen what fate this character awaits.\nBut since this was me inside this body, I thought to change my destiny.\nFor the fourteen years of my life, I did everything in a better way and never showed the sign of being an arrogant bastard as I was in the manga.\nTraining diligently, acquiring world knowledge, and helping people in need, I did everything which seemed natural for me to do.\nWell, ironically I found parents in this life just like my previous ones.\nThey hated me for some reason.\nI was the third child of my father and mother just like my older brother and sister. There wasn't any case of being a child of a concubine or maid to get hated in the house.\nI was a legitimate child of Count and Countess.\nYet, I was clearly able to see how partial their love was for me and their other two children.\nThe loving gaze they direct at them and they stare they bestow upon me visibly felt different.\nBut since I was used to such behavior I didn't think of it more than necessary.\nI was getting a home to live in. A luxurious life to enjoy and enough resources to build my foundation as a mage warrior.\nI had planned everything on how I would avoid the protagonist and his harem when I would start my academy after turning fifteen.\nI even had decided my future and how I would spend the rest of my life in this unknown world.\nBut everything came down crashing as, on just the day of my birthday, a black and white screen popped in front of my retina.\n[The Villain System]\nAs the name suggests, I was tasked to do stuff that a villain does in a story to torment the hero and in the end, get killed like useless garbage.\nNaturally doing something disgusting and behaving like a scum didn't sound good to me, so I thought to not use the system at all.\nI was getting powerful by myself slowly and steadily so I thought it was okay for me not to use this system and live how I used to.\nBut what made my mind blank and my thought process reverse in an instant was the rewards it offered.\nThe system worked on a weekly reward basis. The villainous deeds I would partake in the whole 7 days would be counted and the system would reward me on the seventh day.\nIf the reward would have only the artifacts and stats advancement, then I would have ignored the system entirely.\nBut the added reward at the bottom of the list made my heart shake vibrantly and made all my previous reasoning burn at once.\n[Host can use the points he accumulates in the week to cure any illness or injury of a person who belongs to any part of this multiverse.]\nWhat's more, the system confirmed that the timeline of this world and the previous one were highly mismatched.\nIf I have been reborn here for fourteen years, then in my previous world it must be only 14 days passed since my death.\nMy elation went beyond words when I realized such a reward.\nAfter all, with this, I would be able to save the sole person, the only being who I hold dearest to my heart.\nI disregarded every previous plan of mine for a better future and started writing a new page of my villain's plot.\nStarting from my family I started behaving like a useless brat who threw tantrums at everything and started acting like a pervert who was born to chase skirts.\nSurprisingly, the behavior of my parents and siblings remained the same as they were before with me. More like their expressions toward me started looking more justified.\nBut even with that, my first week of being an asshole, went like hell.\nDespite how much I tried to behave like a haughty noble I was still far from used to it.\nBut somehow I managed to attain 300 points which the system asked me to complete my weekly supply.\nThere was still doubt in my mind about how I would be sure about my desired reward when I wasn't in that world anymore.\nBut the system took care of it too, which didn't help but only motivated me to continue my evil deeds as a useless Noble and good-for-nothing son.\n**Knock**\nA set of knocks pulled me out of my stupor as I heard my maid calling for me.\n\"Young Master, the preparation has been done.\"\nHumming in response I jumped off my hair and stood straight while facing myself in the mirror.\nSlapping my sullen face which became like this because I reminisced, I inhaled deeply.\nTaking my back straight I stretched my lips into a wide curve and narrowed my eyes in a way where my previous sullen look started seeming better.\n...\n\"We have arrived, young master.\"\nStood outside the carriage gate was my kind and beautiful maid who had an expressionless face directed toward me.\nHer beautiful facial features displayed nothing but annoyance and loath in my presence.\nShe was a very cheerful maid when she was assigned to my service but the deeds I performed on her resulted in a complex relationship between the master and servant.\n\"What's that ugly face for? Aren't you honored to be greeted by your master's graceful appearance? I think I should better teach you something good, tonight.\"\nUpon hearing my lascivious remark she sneered visibly but didn't lift her gaze. Since I already said enough to grant myself a point or two I didn't wait long and got out.\n[Ding!]\n[+2 points for inaudible curse]\nSure enough, I got the verification of my act.\nEven if I said something like that just some moments ago, it wasn't like I have done something like punishing her or doing anything more than vulgar comments.\nI still was a virgin and never dared to touch a woman who clearly holds nothing but resentment toward me.\nEven though I was engaged past 8 years, I still haven't even held hands in that way with my fiancee, not to talk about kissing and stuff.\nWalking elegantly I made my way inside the ceremonial hall which looked exquisite from the inside out.\nMany students have already arrived and been enjoying the party.\nThe smell of fresh drinks and delicacies penetrated my senses as soon I stepped inside the hall.\nThe crowd of people glanced at me once but didn't come to talk to me, more like they just pretended to see pass through and ignored my existence entirely.\nThe two side goons of mine who were there with me in my bullying have also left my side knowing fully well, what my actions would cause them.\nSince the choir already started playing elegant classic music, it signified that it was time for the couple dance.\nSince the dance happens nearly at the end of the ceremony, I concluded that my arrival was too late.\nBut there was a reason for my late appearance at the ceremony.\nAnd looking at my fiancè who was about to get on the dance floor with a man whome I have been targeting since day one, I knew my intention didn't go in vain.\nCoughing lightly I changed my expression into a very ugly one before I walked up to my fiancè.\nLilia Von Verlin.\nFor a second, upon seeing her elegant figure which was so adored by her pink gown, I halted in my step. The happy smile that she was directing at the hero was too precious for me to destroy.\nBut at the end of the day, everyone lives for their own selfishness...\n\"What do you think you are doing Lilia!\"\nI shouted at top of my lung which gathered a whole lot of attention from my surroundings and naturally the person with whome I directed my displeasure, also turned toward me.\n\"Getting intimate with a man who isn't your fiancè and ignoring the one who actually is, don't think I will easily forgive this you man hunting whore. Leave him and kneel for forgiveness right now!\"\nWith both hands on my waist, I glared furiously at the woman whome I swear to never hurt until the system arrived. But now, I was the one who has given the most pain to her.\nUpon hearing my remark Lilia bit her lower lip and clutched the hold on the hero's arm more rigidly.\n\"I refuse.\"\nTimidly she responded but since it wasn't enough for me to gain points I continued with my verbal garbage.\n\"Wh-...what did you just say...You are disobeying me? Your lord, your future husband? If you don't want me to kill that bastard standing beside you then beg for mercy right at this instance!!\"\nIt was a baseless warning as I didn't have the strength to go against the hero of humanity in any way possible.\nBut looking at murderous gazes from the women around the hero and especially from Lilia, I was sure I accomplished my goal.\nBut I didn't expect even in my dream that the shy and tame Lilia would take this step.\n**SLAP**\n\"Don't you dare touch Kyouki-kun!\"\nMy cheek felt burning with a numb sensation spreading across my face. For some seconds I wasnt able to realize what happened as the world for me switched upside down.\nIt was Lilia who pulled me out of my stupor as her words again reached my senses.\n\"On the name of my father, I, Lilia Von Verlin from this very moment call off our engagement. I have already told my father about it so don't worry about the compensation. Now get lost from here and don't show that face of yours ever again!!.\"\nNow did I come to understand, that Lilia who was so gentle and kind to me in the past had to take this harsh step because of my words toward the man she loves? And not only that she even annulled the engagement which I had expected but still it felt a little too soon.\nAnd a little too sad...\nI hung my head low as I knew my facial expression was ugly enough to unbecoming a villain.\nThe system was notifying me of the tens of points I was receiving but I turned blindfolded it.\nIt wasn't like I was hit in the face for the first time under the onlooking gazes of this many people. But this sole slap actually shook my heart.\nLilia was the only person in this life who had a friendly relationship with me.\nAfter our engagement and before the time I received the system, we had a great time together.\nWe played together, went on dates, and we even cried our grief and supported each other at some point in our lives.\nUntil my fourteenth birthday, I had planned my lively future with my fiancè even though there was a chance of her being stolen by the protagonist. I made plans for it too.\nBut everything fell apart with the slap. And in all honesty, it was something I had completely foresaw after taking everything I have done to Lilia into account.\nBut why I was feeling so much hurt right now...?\nWas I expecting something miraculous?\nWas I expecting her to see through my act and forgive me in the end?\nI didn't know and didn't want to think about it either.\nThe fact was I gained the score and voluntarily pushed the woman out of my life I once vowed to live forever.\nHanging my head in the lowest possible, I turned and started walking out of the hall while receiving mixed reactions of mockery and satisfaction from my surrounding.\nThe system panel was notifying me continuously about the single-digit points I was earning yet I didn't dare to even look for it right now.\nI was scared to know how much people hate me and loved to watch me fall...\nI was terrified...\n...\nWalking silently in the garden I made my way toward the bench where I usually sit alone at night to heal myself whenever I get injured by the hero or his party member. And also the place which helps me recover my will to move forward.\nIt wasn't anything special but a place that was the farthest situated in the school and mostly wasn't visited by anyone because of the creepy vibe it provides.\nSitting after loosening my necktie and getting rid of my boots, I opted for the system's notification for my rewards.\n[Ding!]\n[Weekly requirements have been fulfilled]\n[Host will be granted the rewards shortly..]\n[Calculating the surplus..]\n[Creating the suitable rewards....]\n[Ding!]\n[You have received:-\nTears of Phoenix    ->   X10\nGrappling Gloves -> 1 pair\nStatus point          ->  + 30]\n[As instructed the rewards would be stored in the inventory and the default reward would be transferred to the entity, User has bestowed upon.]\nSmiling at the last part of the reward I took something out of my inventory.\nIt was a smartphone that the system granted me upon its arrival.\nThe phone couldn't be used for anything but surveillance of a certain person.\nThis was the very reason why I trusted the system and started following the villain route.\nTapping on the screen a live video started displaying over the phone.\nThe screen was focused on a person who was currently lying on a hospital bed with multiple chords attached to her veins and an oxygen mask covering her nose and mouth.\n\"Doctor!! The patient just reacted right now!\"\n\"Hmm? Did she? Impressive. Day by day her recovery is making me believe the impossible. Quick bring me....\".\nI smiled upon hearing the hustle around the hospital room which showed that the reward actually was transferred as I desired.\nMaybe the system was fooling me all this time to make me do such hideous acts through this fake video. But until I have hope to save the person I love the most in the world, I believe it was worth it.\nSince I had no limited time to watch these live videos, I soon curled up in a comfortable position and leisurely stared at the calm face of the girl on my screen.\nShe instantly healed my soul like she usually does, and helped me recover the sorrow I have built some moments ago.\nWith this, I think I could do it...\nBut what made my mind blank and heart go wild was a scent that I was somewhat familiar with.\nI wasn't able to sense mana around me but the vivid fluorescent smell told me that someone was close and was watching me intently.\nI would have found it weird being surveillance like this knowing my reputation but when realizing who this fragrance belonged to...I was horrified\n'Why the heck she is here!!?'\n___________...____________\nA/N:- He is a little weak-minded and fragile when it comes to emotional stuff but dont worry. The strong Luna will help him grow up like a real man.\nI know it would be irritating to see the Mc hide his abilities but endure it for a short while. After all, he has a reason for it.\nAnd if you have liked the chapter then let me know in the comments~",

      "content": "'What is this place...who is she...?'\nFrowning I contemplated upon seeing the weird thing which was displaying an image of a black-haired girl.\nHer mouth was covered with a strange transparent thing which I haven't seen until now. And her facial features also looked foreign.\nNot to talk about the weird strings connected to her wrist and arm which made it look like her a puppet or something.\nI wasn't sure why Austin was so relaxed upon seeing the girl when the person was looking in so much worse condition on the blue stone.\n\"Ah...I should now get going...\"\nSuddenly Austin awkwardly got up and started walking away in a fluster.\nIt wasnt tough to discern that he was pretending to not notice me as he even forgot his shoes to wear before dashing away.\n\"Wait.\"\nNearly shouting I pulled his attention toward me, in which I somehow succeeded.\nHis body jerked and soon the blue rectangular thing from his hand disappeared, more like it was sent somewhere.\n\"You...Do you know Space magic? Amazing.\"\nI was aware that Austin was an elemental user but he or anyone in the academy using Space Time magic was still unheard of.\nExcluding myself, I have never seen a teenage mage accomplish such a feat.\nAnother thing I found interesting tonight.\nIt took Austin time to turn toward me while I walked around the bench and got comfortable on it.\n\"Huh, so what? I-I know various things which your useless mind isn't capable of even dreaming. Just forget what you have seen and...and bye-bye..\"\nFluttering his robe specifically to signify how haughty he was...or he pretended to be, he started walking again.\n'Hmmm....why so soon?'\nSmiling in a way that I haven't found myself with in so long, I drew a magic circle on the place where Austin's next step would have landed.\n**Swish**\n\"Huh?\"\nSitting just some meters beside me was a startling arrogant noble who somehow wasn't looking like his usual self at all.\nCute was the word?\nYeah, he was kinda cute at this moment.\n\"How I ended up here!! Di-did you do something you dumb bitch!!\"\nHe again stood up while cursing me in a way that showed how tough it was for him to say something like that.\nIt was clear that he had always prepared himself to bad-mouth, anyone as not only today, whenever I have come across him accidentally he always blushed and only with a fake scowl dashed away.\nI knew something was fishy with him that's why I followed him today and was reluctant to let him go too.\n\"No, just sit here.\"\nUsing the Diving magic [Nature's support] I pulled out two strings of prolonged grass to hold his limbs in place and make him back down.\n\"Ah!\"\nWith a small cry, he was held back successfully before I grabbed his hand if he tried to use force again.\n\"Now stay here with me.\"\nStaring intently at his emerald eyes I made my point clear even though I was sounding a little unusual right now.\nThis domination, this persuasion... I don't think I have applied toward anyone but with Austin, it felt the most natural thing to do.\nThankfully the prideful prince accepted my request and with redness covering his face, didn't struggle any further.\n\"I-If you are begging so much then b-but keep your filthy hands away from m-me...\"\nHe was stuttering so much that it took him half a minute to finally complete a sentence.\nHis tongue was tied in a way like he was limited to only made-up words and the way he was reacting with his body temperature rising, made his arrogant impression crumble even more.\nHis unsteady glance and the reluctance to look at me straight definitely didn't justify how in the past, he violently cursed my looks and made fun of aesthetics.\nRight now I could cleanly perceive how shy he was just even with the hand I was holding.\nBut I wasn't a sadist to let him suffer...\nOr maybe I was.\n\"First answer some of my questions then I would release your hand.\"\nAustin narrowed his gaze and resisted my advances entirely.\n\"Leaving this conversation is in my capabilities, Miss Luna Lastov. So don't force me to use violent means to get rid of you.\"\nBeing glared like that he somewhat seemed different.\nNot that shy Austin was bad, but this determined Austin seemed even better.\n\"Then try it, I won't force you to stay. But the fact that you can use space magic and have a weird device which no one is aware of, might raise suspicion toward your origin, Sir Austin Wright.\"\nHis body jerked visibly as his glare turned into perplexion as he started roaming his eyes in ponder.\nBut I was only a Saint in the name. I don't like to give my target time to make something to counter before I launch my final blow.\n\"Won't your pretense would be ruined if they were to know how you always hold back whenever a fight breaks out and how every time you force yourself to say such hurtful comments?\"\nNow the haughty prince has completely shattered into pieces. The one who was in front of my eyes was truly a terrified being, who visibly wanted to just disappear from this place right at this instance.\nBut I didn't have enough...\n\"Not to talk about the ball event. You were clearly forcing yourself to say such a thing about Kyouki right? Don't think I didn't see how your lips were trembling and legs were shaking when Lilia broke off the engagement. Your anxiety your regret, don't assume I didn't saw that because under my watch you can't hide yourself at all. I can see right through you, master~Austin\"\nI whispered my thoughts from start to end mercilessly in his ears while enjoying the slow reactions he was giving in between my talk.\nAfter I finished my declaration, I gawked intently at the man who was completely different from what I have seen until now.\nHis face was covered with his long blond hair but his palpitating body told me that he was beyond furious right now.\nI was ready for any kind of violence if he advanced upon me, but what I wasn't ready for...\n\"...demon.\"\nGlaring at me, I was bestowed by a sight that I might not be able to forget for my life, ever.\nThe arrogant and self-obsessed son of Count Vincent Wright who was famous for his hideous behavior and snake tongue was weeping right now?\nHis tame expression showed how wronged he was feeling right now. His flushed cheeks, his red nose, his moist eyes were so...\n\"Adorable\".\nHis eyes became wider as he heard my unintentional voiced remark but before he could react, I moved toward him and wrapped my hand around his head before draping it over my bosom.\nKeeping my head over his, I started rubbing his back gently to make this bullied child calm.\n\"Aw...I am sorry.  I didn't think that my poor Austin would get hurt to such an extent.\"\nI patted his back rhythmically while grazing my hand over his smooth hair.\nFor some moments he was dead stiff but soon he started to relax enough to the point his whole body was supported by me.\nI didn't know what he was going through in reality and what made him forced to do such an act, but there was something I was sure about.\nI want to know more about Austin Wright.\nThis might be the first time for me to feel something like this toward someone but strangely I was happy to gain such a feeling toward Austin.\nIt was weird how a person who has tormented me for so long still made a place in my heart.\nBut I didn't hate it...\nRemembering his pained look and his teary eyes just some moments ago, I felt something igniting inside me. Something I have kept dormant until now was emerging furiously.\nBut strangely I was welcoming all of it...\nI was accepting myself.\n____________.._____________\nAt the same time when Luna was pampering Austin, a certain figure was staring at the pair from far away.\nStanding on a branch of a tall cedar tree a young and handsome youth with midnight shade hair looked at the scene with a complicated look on his face.\nFrom the time Luna hugged Austin, he became utterly furious and enraged at the situation which he felt weird from the start.\nThe young man who has been bestowed by the goddess of Light and has been looked upon by millions doesn't hold any kind of feeling toward anything special.\nEven though he had friends and loyal subordinates, he doesn't feel the spark he feels toward this certain girl who was in his clear perception, right now.\nThe hero of Humanity Kyouki doesn't have to create nor had built anything or any relationship which could hinder him from his mission.\nBut only a single girl, was the source of his wavering heart.\nHe had vowed to never kill any innocent in his lifetime nor have thought to bestow death upon someone just because of his own selfishness.\nBut looking at this sight, his promises seemed to be shaky and fragile.\nClutching his fist he broke a huge chunk of raw wood from the tree in agitation as a single thought emerged in his mind.\n'You better be prepared for the consequences of your actions, Austin Wright.\"\n____________..._____________\nA/N:- Leme tell you one thing to calm your anxiety, Luna is hella powerful and could beat the shit out of the hero.\nBut she won't be the one to do such a thing, after all, Austin didn't gather so many points for the whole year, for nothing.\nAnyway, if you liked the chapter then please comment and if you have time then please check the recent post I have posted on my profile wall.\nPeace ✌️",

      "content": "It's been four days since that night with the heroine, which changed my life in a complete U.\nThe time when she came to talk to me specifically and was reluctant to let go, I was sure I did some mistake in my performance.\nBut when she started confessing why she took an interest in me, I became speechless.\nShe didn't only see flaws in my act on the ball night but the main heroine, who had so many vital roles in the story, was actually keeping an eye on me since long enough to know my behaviors and fake words.\nI was baffled and shook down the core.\nFrom what I have read in manga, the main heroine was the most famous among the audience because of her cold and aloof personality which seemed completely shatter around me.\nI was confused, beyond belief.\nAnd not only that night. She even started meddling in my business more often after that.\nGreeting me sweetly in the morning, joining me in battles, helping me in classes, and many other small interactions which I wasn't used to or wanted to happen.\nI tried every kind of mockery and taunts in the start but looking at her unwavered determination, I soon accepted my defeat.\nBut backing down from separating myself from heroin was due to another reason too.\nFrom the manga and what I have observed in this half year, I was sure that the protagonist, Hero Kyouki was in love with Luna.\nI wasn't sure about the other harem member as he always seemed dense around them, but I have seen the gaze he directs at Luna.\nI wasn't an expert in love matters but aligning the manga plot and the real Kyouki's partial treatment of the saint, it wasn't tough to conclude.\nThat was the reason why I wasn't resisting Luna as much in my whole capability.\nI knew if heroin was to grow close to me, the hero would somehow confront me and that would be my high point to play the villain and provoke him, so I could gain the points.\nI know using Luna for this wasn't something I would have usually preferred but at the end of the day, she was the heroine who was destined to be united with the hero.\nEven if I don't use her and let things flow as they should have, nothing would change except for the fact that I would not get the chance to gain points.\nSo I grabbed the opportunity in the hope to clear the weekly requirement before Wednesday.\nBut...\n[Weekly Requirement: 180/1200 VP]\n[Time left:- 50h.12m. 26s]\nI was doomed.\nI only had two days to gain more than a thousand points, which I was never able to do in the past.\nI never had missed the weekly hunt that's why I was unaware of failure, but I didn't dare to let it happen.\nAll this time I just wished her to get back on her feet and smile like she always did.\nIf my mistake could take the chance of her revival, then I wasn't sure what I would do to myself.\nI was leniently letting things happen how they shouldn't have and before I know it, that confrontation with the hero never happened.\nSince I was getting paired with Luna but not any harem member or Nobel personality, my points from sparring were also consumed by the presence of the saint around me.\n'Fuck... this'd going to be hectic...'\nLuckily I still had a chance to gain the remaining point in one go if things happen as I desire them to.\nA one-day exploration of the Great Eastern Jungle would happen in which students have to pair with their party members.\nI was sure Luna would ask me, which I would eventually accept.\nAnd after that, I would start my plot for the perfect villain scenario.\nThe plan which immediately formed in my mind was whether directly or not would lead Hero's sword in my direction and it would be the best point booster I need.\nI know after what I was planning to do, Luna would not see me in the same light again. Or to say, she would probably hate me in the end, but that would be okay for me.\nWell, it would be a lie to say that I won't feel a little lonely without her being around me and such, but at the end of the day, I was nothing more than a minor villain after all, who was destined to be forgotten.\n'Yes, it would be for the best for all...'\n_______________________\n[\nLilia's POV]\n'It's strange...'\nMaking my way inside the base that Kyouki-kun have formed for the general team meeting, I thought of the sudden summoning notice.\nKyouki-kun often used this room for discussion for the future prospectus and how we would participate in lairs and such but at this hour of the night, it felt a little out of place.\nWell, since it was Kyouki-kun I knew he wouldn't do anything to me and I was also not ready for it yet, and after seeing the other party members entering the room as well, my little bit of suspicion also vanished.\n\"Good evening, Lilia-san.\"\n\"Good evening Charlotte.\"\nGreeted me with a sweet smile was my friend and comrade in battles, Charlotte Spencer, daughter of Baron Philiard Spencer.\nShe's a great mage in our team and also a rival I share in a battleground and in romance battles too.\n\"Oh hey, guys. I hope I am not late~\"\nThe one who excitedly swung inside the room was Venessa Charles, daughter of the knight commander Sir Laviski Charles.\nShe's a high-spirited girl who generally doesn't get disheartened because of anything. Drawing out any real emotion from her from under her natural facade was only possible for Kyouki-kun.\nIn the team, she works as the shield of Kyouki-kun which generally makes me envy her being so close to him, but apart from that, I like her.\n\"Ohayooo*\nThe one who just yawned while greeting lazily was Sicily Seymour, daughter of Duke Reynold Seymour.\nShe's the most prominent figure in our team from a political point of view and even in battle evaluation, she holds the most importance after Kyouki-kun.\nThe versatile nature of hers which she uses in combat by providing any kind of support in need makes her the most dependable comrade and most lovable friend of mine.\nApart from Kyouki-kun, she generally doesn't seem to pay attention to anything or anyone, which we also have become accustomed to.\nAfter we all were seated and were conversing casually, another person entered the room which made my heart flutter in an instant.\nSensing the silence around the room I was sure that every other girl also have been similarly looking at him.\nEntered inside was the man I have found my 'first' love in, Kyouki-kun.\n(A/N:- I will upload character design in an auxiliary chapter)\n\"It seems everyone is here.\"\nSmiling sweetly he walked toward the head seat of the table before sitting down gracefully.\nBut upon hearing his remark my brows frowned slightly.\n\"Kyouki-kun...what about Luna-san?\"\nExpecting the healer and the vice-commander in our team to be present during the team meeting was the most general concern. And looking at others I was sure, I wasn't alone in thinking about it.\n\"Yeah, she should have arrived first from what I have seen so far.\"\nLuna-san was the most diligent toward her duty and was very conscious about what people expected from her, so her absence did make things look startling.\nWell, her recent 'actions' which were involved with a 'certain someone' did seem out of place but still neglecting her duty as a guardian wasn't something I expected from her.\nAll of our eyes were focused on Kyouki-kun who unlike usual didn't have a great expression right now.\n\"It's about her for which I called this meeting.\"\nHis serious expression made us straighten our backs also, as we knew our captain always becomes like this whenever the matter was something which required utmost concern.\nSighing Kyouki-kun leaned back which signified how tense he was about the thing he was going to say.\n\"It seems Luna has been cursed\".\nMy eyes went wide instantly as I heard him clearly yet my senses weren't able to believe it at all.\n\"Cursed!? Are you sure about it Kyouki-kun, that it's related to that?\"\nIt was Sicily-san who unlike usual, raised her voice.\nWell, it wasnt her exaggerating the matter, more like she was expressing her thoughts most naturally.\nCurse magic wasn't something that we were even allowed to talk about inside the campus and here Kyouki-kun presented that someone was under influence of it?\nI was too shocked to even speak anything so I just chose to listen for now...\n\"Yes, I have verified it in these four days when Luna was straying from her usual self. Being involved in things she generally thinks waste of time and expressing her thoughts in a way that I never saw her in. If not for curse magic I don't think there is any other spell that could manipulate a Divinity-ranked Saint to such extent \".\nCertainly, her recent behavior has thrown not only us but the entire school into a state of complete shock\nThe way she expresses her feelings reacts to remarks of a single person's words, and the way she smiles all the time when she stays with that person, never happened when she was with Kyouki-kun.\nHer change of romantic preference was the best base to provide support to Kyouki-kun's evaluation for her.\n\"I trust you Kyo-kun with all my heart.\"\nIt was Sicily-san who got up and started her trust in Kyouki-kun.\n\"Sicily...\"\nKyouki-kun smiled sweetly toward the determined Sicily-san making the latter blush excessively before I heard another announcement.\n\"I never lost faith in you, to begin with, so count me in too.\"\n\"Yes, Kyouki-sama I also trust your words.\"\n\"It's the same for me too, Kyouki-kun. I also believe in you.\"\nFinishing my words I smiled at the emotional Kyouki-kun who was looking at us with a grateful smile making my heart race all of a sudden.\n\"Guys you..no, first of all, thank you for believing in me.\"\nIt was strange how this person without even noticing gives me butterflies even with his single glance.\nSeeing how he generously behaves with us even though he has so many responsibilities, makes me sure that what I did during the ball wasn't regretful.\nMore like I am thankful to that man that his actions helped me to meet this great person whom I love the most in the world.\n'At least you did something good for once...'\nSighing inwardly I sat down just like others when Charlotte-san brought up another matter related to the previous one.\n\"Anno... If Luna-san is cursed then who is the sorcerer?\"\nMy mind went blank for a second as it wasn't hard to realize the answer to her question and it seemed, unlike Charlotte everyone knew the answer as they opened their eyes wide.\n\"Ky-Kyouki-kun...i-is it him...\"\nMy shaky voice reached him somehow as I asked in a little disbelief and expectancy for a negative answer but it seems 'that man' was just made for every single evil deed in the world.\n\"It's Austin Wright who has conjured Luna.\"\n____________________...\nA/N:- Uh drama will surely commence.\nUm...I wanna clarify something.\nThe MC would be like this, I mean being punched by others and pushed around with emotional breakdowns for some initial chapters before I will make a path for char development.\nAnd do remember he won't turn hero just because the heroine would be his side. More like he would become what it actually means to be a villain.\nAnyway, if you have time then check my profile wall and drop a comment too~",

      "content": "Note:- Evey Class of monsters carries three stages except for the last two. The general difference between the classes depends on the monster's strength and bloodline.\nThe basic idea of each class:-\nCommon - Those who could be found anywhere in the suburb or nearby forest. Most of the monsters that belong to the Common category don't carry any lethal force which could kill humans in one attack. However if not cautious the uppermost level of the Common category could wipe out an army of Novice Rank humans.\nRare:- Those who could be found majorly in lairs and rarely in the parameter of the jungle. A creature belonging to a rare class could compete with an Expert Rank Human and the higher of this category can go against the whole battalion on their own.\nUnique:- Lair bosses/Masters. Generally doesn't wander in the outside world and a particular type could be found in certain lairs. This rank of monster can go against Legend Rank humans.\nTerror:- Anonymous appearance at ancient ruins or sites of World War. There is no full proof evidence of how a terror-rank monster erupts but there was a saying that these monsters never left the surface since the disappearance of Demon Lord and are waiting for their peerage to return so they can run rampant again. A Terror Ranker monster requires Divinity Ranked Human.\nMythic:- Those beings who went extinct along with their liege, Demon Lord. The executive who served their lord until the final moment was the creatures who have been mentioned in countless tales and fairy books. A mythic rank monster can wipe a whole nation in one blow and require a full-fledged hero to defeat.\nDemon Lord:- The one who holds the planetary level power and could wipe humanity from existence if nothing seemed to interest it. The sole existence whose roots no one has been able to configure nor anyone have been able to see its face except for one until now. Hero Maximus, who is also the blood-related ancestor of the current hero of Humanity, Hero Kyouki.\n_____________________\nJungle Exploration.\nThe trial which every student after passing the first semester of the first year has to partake, once a month.\nEven though it's named 'Exploration', the real motive of the trials was to let students know what the real thing they were training for.\nThe Eastern Jungle was filled with monstrosities and unimaginable dangers which could push a person to the brink of their extreme or help build their foundation.\nThe mission was to bring anything which one finds suitable enough to pass the Exploration Exam.\nWhether it's a newly found herb or a monster's residuals, one has to bring proof of their achievement so the council could evaluate a student's potential.\nIn the manga, the Eastern Jungle despite being not the most dangerous one among the other jungles was a site where a full-fledged war took place and the shelter where greater demons took refuge.\nThere was a specific reason for such a future that I still wasnt ready to face or maybe I didnt want to face it.\nIn the manga, it was the first exploration when the hero saved the main heroine and made an extremely pleasant impression on her.\nThe same old Damsel in Distress troupe helped the protagonist to enter the heart of the main heroine, Luna and from there the main storyline initiated.\nAs I remember, there was only a couple of minor demon which were spotted during the first expedition of the hero, which eventually led humanity to know how monsters were close to them even without getting noticed.\nThere were pretty hectic things that would be taking place which would make the hero grow exponentially and of course, becomes the apple of humanity's eyes.\nBut I would be at a loss if the hero gets the attention as I still have to gain at least 3 weeks of Villains points to get 'her' back into condition.\nI wasn't planning on playing villain after three weeks and would let the story progress as it should without my presence, but the problem was ...\n'Will I be able to live until the end...?'\nThe hero was unfairly strong to the point he could go against the strongest warrior in the school and that was the headmaster. I wasn't belittling myself as I do have magic as my upper hand but Hero has the most dependable weapon with him, which could help him surpass any threats.\n'Power of Love&Friendship'.\nAs he sees his harem as friends rather than lovers his trust in them and vice versa creates an inexhaustible fighting spirit in him which I would probably prefer to avoid.\n'But I have to face him today...'\nCurrently, I was waiting for Luna who went to register our names as a party at the school records.\nAs I expected she wasn't aware of the hidden malice I was carrying for her.\nIn all honesty, I was feeling miserable doing what I have thought but this was my last shot to accomplish my weekly chore.\nIt wasn't something I chose but something I couldn't just ignore because of the fragile state of my mind.\n\"Did you wait long~\"\nWaving at me Luna shouted as she started walking in my direction with a blooming smile on her moon-white face.\nThinking that I would be betraying her in some hours made my heart clench. It reminded me of how miserable I have become and what future awaits me, but there was nothing I could do rather than accept such a destiny.\n'I am sorry Luna...'\n______________________________\n[Kyouki's POV:]\n'This might be my last chance.'\nClutching my fist, I stared at nothingness while thinking of the way I would be bringing Luna back.\nThe Luna I knew since day one and the Luna I fell in love with just upon landing my eyes on has left my side to be with a sinful man.\nThe man who since day one was targeting me for no reason and also was bad-mouthing Luna the most in the past had her on top of his palm.\nI didn't know how it happened but Luna was conjured by that sick man.\nSince Luna was a divine-level priest I had a clear base to prove that no illusionary or mind-mending spell would work on her.\nThat leaves only one path for me to lean on.\n'Curse Magic'.\nThe magic which was created and affiliated with humanity's enemy was now being used by a fellow student whom I didn't think was anything more than a child throwing tantrum.\nNever had I imagined the silly arrogant would fall into such a state where he would give up on his humanity to obtain the person I treasure the most.\n'No, I have to take responsibility...'\nAs I resolved myself, my team members came inside the meeting room again as I asked them to.\nSeeing them so diligently following my plan which was formed on just a hunch makes my heart delighted.\nI could never repay the trust they have bestowed upon me.\nThat's why I had promised myself that whatever happens, I would protect them with my life on line...\n...and of course Luna too.\n\"Let's revise the plan before we depart.\"\nAfter the greeting, I proposed the idea to recollect the information and plan I have formed and told them last night.\nUpon hearing me the four ladies nodded and became serious.\n\"The motive of our expedition would be to help Luna get back to her senses by separating her from Austin. Since he has manipulated her, attacking Austin would lead us to face Luna eventually. So our primary goal is to create a deviation between them and after that would the main plan begin.\"\nEveryone nodded after passing glances at each other.\nI was fortunate to gain such understanding partners who understood my motive and formed their own strategy on how they would hold Luna back.\nDespite Luna's nature of magic being the Supportive one, we all knew she was hiding something. Something which could ruin our plan to baptize her, if we were to take a single careless step.\nThat's why I have organized all of my four party members to divert Luna's attention and give me time alone with Austin.\n\"Since we don't know what kind of spell Austin has cast on her we couldn't deal with Luna, rather I will use my [Christine of Light] upon the conjurer so we could free Luna and end the demon altogether.\"\nIt might be a hasty decision of mine and surely it was making me nervous a little too, but I have to end Austin as soon as possible.\nI never had killed a human but unsurprisingly thinking about what he has done to Luna he doesn't seem human to me anymore.\nHe was a demon who needs to be exterminated.\n\"B-but what if he hasn't used curse magic on Luna-san? Won't Kyouki-kun kill that person even if he isn't a demon cult follower?\"\nCertainly, my [Christine of Light] was my ultimate spell until now which could deal with a horde of Unique class monsters in exchange for taking away all my mana, but I wasn't sure what kind of demon have taken over Austin, that's why the blessing of light was my only call.\nBut the problem was the wavering emotions of my certain comrade Lilia-san who seemed to still have some feelings for the man she once called her fiancé.\nIt wasn't her fault to have a soft corner for Austin but Austin has become someone which I nor anyone could help with, so resolving myself I went toward Lilia-san.\nHolding her hand, I felt her trembling from head to toe which must have come from Austin's memory.\nLooking at her red face I assured her.\n\"I know it must be hard for you Lilia-san to see your old friend and ex-fiancé dying on the battleground but you have to make your will strong. That man isn't a human anymore since the time he sacrificed his humanity for such deeds, so don't let your memories drag you down and help me kill that thing once and for all.\"\nUpon hearing me,  she teared up a little before she asked something in a sniffling sound.\n\"Kyouki-kun....c-can you hold me for a bit...\"\nComing from the shy Lilia I was really surprised nonetheless if it were for my friends and family I could do anything, so this hug was nothing to mind about.\nI wrapped my arms around her before she started weeping more soundly this time.\nSharing a nod with everyone, my gaze fixed on my sword which was lying dormant for a long and now it would finally taste the blood it thirst the most.\n_________________\n[3rd Person POV:]\nThe exploration takes place in a 12-hour duration starting from 9 in the morning until the downfall.\n300 students and more than 50 teams were ready with their weapons and armor intact as they gathered at the entrance of the jungle with a slightly older-looking woman facing them.\nShe was the instructor who was in charge of the on-field activity of today's class and was also assigned to have a closer watch on a particular Nobel man, or to say, Austin Wright.\n\"Okay, listen carefully. Whatever you do, wherever you go don't get into danger where you are not confident of winning. The wristband you have would signify to me instantly if you are in a grave situation by entailing me your psychological condition. But even without that, if you think you need help and want to withdraw from the test then just simply tear that band off your wrist. Any questions?\"\nSince the students were told about the expedition already in classes no one raised their hand before the instructor ran her violet eyes across the field.\nHer gaze halted on two groups consisting of five and two people team.\n\"Okay then go!\"\nHearing so, every student disappeared from sight as they jumped inside the jungle at a furious pace.\nEveryone took a different route inside the dense forest to get the most loot and complete the test as soon as possible.\nAs planned Austin was leading Luna to the place where he have suspected uneven mana before, to get the demon's attention and commence his plan.\nAnd the hero's party too, as planned was following the duo from a decent distance to sabotage them and separate Luna from Austin.\n'This time I will save you, Luna. Just wait for me.'\n_____________________________\nA/N:- I know this chapter was kinda boring but the upcoming chapters would make you surprised, cry and even giggle in delight.\nSo look forward to it and let the comments roll ~",

      "content": "'It eventually happened huh....?'\nStanding in the middle of the jungle where some portion of the land was cleared stood me and my arch rival or I have made him, Hero Kyouki.\nMy plan was ruined in the first hour of exploration as suddenly I and Luna were ambushed and taken by surprise.\nIt wasn't hard to discern that the team who came to hold us was none other than humanity's greatest hope, the hero's party along with the embodiment of light, Kyouki himself.\nI first panicked but as soon I realized what their motive was I became natural and even started cooperating by keeping myself away from their trap and leading my path completely different from Luna.\nLast I saw, the dazed Luna was surrounded by the hero party which made me sad as how I left her behind. But knowing that Luna was their teammate until some days ago, I was sure that they won't hurt her.\nNow that leaves me and his face to face.\nI wasn't sure what he wanted from me, but when he started shouting something like 'curse' 'demons' I concluded that he has taken a ton load of bullshit as reality\nBut I wasn't complaining tho...\nAfter all, this kind of confrontation was something I was planning all along, and even through a different route, we ended up the same as I wished.\n\"Your evil deeds would come to an end today, you monster! How dare you bear your fangs on my pure Luna!\"\nShouting at the top of his lungs I saw the hero being in a rageous temperament which I never had seen until now even though I had done so many things to him\nThis shows what kind of emotions he carries for Luna.\nIn all honesty, it made me cringe a little...\n\"Hoh~ So you finally figured it out huh. Not bad~Not bad. And don't assume that I am just manipulating her, I am also using her at my disposal. Doing all kinds of the things which you heroes categorize as disgusting. Ah~ the way she tastes sends a shiver down my spine~\"\nI acted vulgarly as I felt an enormous amount of mana concentrating in a single place. It wasn't a doubt who was gathering such mana at this moment so I just prepared myself.\nBending my head up I saw the dark expression of the hero which told me that I was successful in ticking out the trigger.\nHonestly, that side of his was a little frightening but coming this far I knew there wasn't any going back.\nHero clutched the hilt of his heavy sword before lifting it in midair and positioning the tip of the blade in my direction.\n\"You have asked for it, do not resent me in your afterlife!\"\nSuddenly his whole body started shining with radiant yellow light which was descending directly from the sky and getting absorbed in the hero.\nMy eyes widened in shock as after some seconds I finally concluded what kind of attack he was planning to direct toward me.\n'I have to get away ...'\nThis was the only thought that came up as I saw the light covering Kyouki's blade to the point where it started to seem like a light saber.\n'What the heck!!!'\nMy body which I tried to move wasn't listening to me at all. I was bound with golden chains which I was familiar with. Not only chains were restricting my movements but also sucking my mana at a furious pace.\nDue to a lack of alertness, I never thought of this possibility and was getting cocky on my own until now.\n\"Don't think I will let you flee you maggot.\"\nThe smiling face of Kyouki blended with the amount of mana he was collecting at a single place giving the scent of something peculiar ...\n...Yes it was of death.\n\"[Christine of Light]\"\n\"Shit!!!\"\nA beam of light descended upon the surface as at a furious pace it made its way toward me, destroying every single thing in its path.\nThe light was so blinding that I wasn't able to see anything at all, before a burning sensation showered over me. I knew I would completely extinguish from existence if I didn't do something...\nSo I did what I never thought to.\n\"Lift all my limiters right now!!!\"\n...\n...\n[..ert!!]\n'Mm...did I recover this soon?' Ah, why is this system shouting..?'\n[Alert!]\n'Huh...this is something new...'\nForcing my leads I open my eyes somehow after recovering a bit from the after effect of the flashing blow.\nIt was great that I lifted my limiter at the last moment or I would surely have perished. But what was making me surprised right now was the continuous alert notification flashing inside my mind.\nStabilizing my consciousness I focused on the notification which became more clear in front of my retina before my narrowed eyes went wide.\n[Alert! The hero is in fatal danger!]\n[Warning! Once the mortal thread of the hero gets severed, the Villain system would collapse entirely!]\nThis warning was self-explanatory and I wasn't able to conclude how such a thing happened. Fortunately, my body works faster than my mind, as while thinking tens of things, I was already standing on my feet.\nMy body was burning and aching in pain with my skin at its highest sensitivity.\nIgnoring the sweat-building ache all over my body, I focused on my surroundings and got even more bewildered.\n'How such a thing happened.'\n____________________________\n[Some minutes ago]\n[Luna's POV]\nI was getting surrounded slowly yet visibly by my old comrades once who shared the battlefield with me.\nHonestly, I didn't have much sentiment attached to them but looking at how sloppy their formation was, I could not help but sigh in helplessness.\nI pretended to not see but I was fully aware of how Austin was distancing himself from me, which made my heart ache but it was something I had assumed all along.\nI let myself get bind up in their formation seal which could only be formed when there's an Expert Class Mage.\nLilia was the conjurer of the bind and others were just helping her maintain the spell by providing mana.\nTechnically I wasn't resisting at all, but looking at their struggle it seemed my mana was acting subconsciously which I also couldn't help.\n\"Please don't resist Luna-san. It's for your own good that you are away from that monster. Please stay like this and we will save you.\"\nIt was Lilia who made me annoyed with her words. I knew what bullshit they have formed by themselves regarding my favourability toward Austin in recent days.\nBut what made me more pissed was when that woman who only less than a week ago was the fiancé of the person she was regarding monster now.\nTruthfully I wanted to obliterate each one of them from existence right at this moment but I held my anger for Austin. I knew acting violently would bring no good so I just stood there motionlessly while gazing in the direction where Austin left.\nI knew telling these four morons anything right now would be counted as a complete waste, so I just chose to let them be the boss of the moment.\n'Hmm...it took longer than I thought...'\nNot so long after a huge beam of light descended upon the earth which was in my full expectancy but knowing who would be under its center made my heart go numb.\nMy mind went blank for a long second as I heard the things around me chattering again.\n\"Ah, how beautiful. Kyouki-san finally brought blessing upon us \"(Venessa)\n\"Now Luna-san would be free from that monster's clutches. I don't know why but I feel a little weight lifting my heart\".(Lilia)\n\"I hope Kyouki-kun didn't hurt himself ~\"(Sicily)\nI was hearing them...\nEnduring them...\nBut not for long as I knew what was about to come so I lightly shrugged my shoulder which dismantled the bind from me, surprising the four.\n\"L-Luna-san....why are you still....don't tell...\"\nWithout paying attention to the thing that was the shame on the name of a woman, I started walking steadily in the direction where my lovely Austin was.\nThe ground started shaking violently when I noticed the [Curse Veil] drawing over the sky and covering almost the northern side of the jungle.\nI didn't halt there and used mana to stabilize my steps before I reached the spot where I was able to see the whole battle zone.\nBeads of tears started forming in my eyes as I saw Austin's condition. He was burnt from head to toe. His fluffy and beautiful hair was black as charcoal was sticking to his head signifying how painful it was for him. His pretty eyes, his small nose, his beautiful smile everything was gone.\nHis body was trembling from tremendous suffering which I was also able to feel a little inside myself yet I could not comprehend how tough it was for him.\nI wanted to touch him right now, but I couldn't.\nI wanted to hold him...\nTo embrace...\nTo let him feel my presence...\nYet I couldn't do anything just because of the existence of a single damn person.\nI was so agitated at the moment that I felt it almost impossible from stopping myself from killing that piece of human trash who regards himself as a hero.\nLooking at his panting state I felt disgusted and anger welling in my chest as I resisted at the best of my ability to not let that accomplishing smile of his tear off his face.\nI knew killing him would push Austin away from me forever, so I just did what I could.\n[Hymn of Eir]\nUsing my best healing spell I helped Austin to get into a condition where he could move freely before I focused my eyes in the direction where a humungous figure just appeared.\nIt certainly was something that could be categorized as gigantic as its shadow made it look like the day has fallen.\nMy eyes despite facing a Terror Class being were still normal as it wasn't something I haven't come across, so I just studied its outer appearance.\nCore made of an unknown substance stood a gigantic monster at a height of more than 70 ft. Its arms and legs were like that of a human except for the fact its whole body was made of a sandstone-like substance. Two ruby eyes stared down at us or more precisely at the hero as the monster finally growled its arrival.\n\"GUOOOOOOOOHHHHHH!!!!\"\n____________________\nA/N:- Sorry for the short chapter. There will be an explanation for why Luna let him get hurt.\nAnd also Luna will help Austin grow as a man and as a villain.\nHer role is vital that's why I said this story is not centered on the only male lead.\nAnyway, drop a comment if you are hyped for Austin in action~",

      "content": "Monster and Demon.\nAs similar as they sounds, they aren't.\nMonsters are those being who lives for only three functions.\nEat. Sex. Sleep.\nA total animalistic habit that they follow from the time they open their eyes and join the world hierarchy.\nSome are born in dungeons and use the core as their food and do everything possible to save their source of energy.\nThose who are commonly found don't even get the sense of protecting anything as they just live on their desires and die just like that.\nBut demons are different.\nEven though some of them look similar, they fundamentally carry something that monsters don't even compare to.\nCurse energy.\nThe presence of this curse energy naturally came into existence from the monarch of Darkness, the Demon Lord who brought this sinful energy and planted the first root of darkness in the world.\nThe creatures who first adapted the curse and become the subordinate of the Supreme Monarch were now remembered through stories and those who came later continued their peerage legacy.\nUnlike monsters, who grow at a very slow pace, demons live on their cannibalism and get stronger as they proceed to hunt all their life.\nAnd also, unlike monsters, demons since they open their eyes have a single desire kept on repeating in their consciousness, and that was to...\nAnnihilate humanity.\nThe newbie demons don't carry anything other than massacre but once a demon attains a certain level they get their own consciousness and could think about how to proceed to end the human race.\nIn either case or in at any level, demons never change.\nBut for a thousand years, the high-class demons have gone dormant after their liege was subdued, so the possibility of one of the high-rank demons belonging to [Terror Class], appearing out of nowhere was thin as a thread.\nYet...\n_._\n'How the fuck something came up at this time ....?!!!'\nAs I remember the first time protagonist visited the jungle he was only met with a dozen of the lowest ranking demons which he naturally obliterated without breaking a sweat.\nBut this living golem was at least on the first stage of the Terror rank from any perspective I could perceive.\nI have faced a Unique class once when I was exploring one of the lairs, but this was on whole another level.\nThe dense curse energy, the sheer murderous intent which was making my stomach churn, this humungous body that was oozing with danger was making my inner mind shout to run away at this instance.\nBut I couldn't run away when the hero was kneeling on the ground with his face paler than a sheet.\nIt was to be expected as the hero was far from ready to face something like this. Heck, not even the Headmaster would be able to defeat this alone, who's among the [Saint Rank].\nGawking at my surrounding I concluded the space has changed as I wasn't able to receive any kind of mana out of a certain range.\n'Is this the veil...?'\nKnowing full well, that no reinforcement would be arriving nor the hero would be of any help, I concluded that I had to face this demon alone.\n'System how many villain points do I require for the week?'\nCollecting mana in my right hand I commenced a spell that needed not more than a couple of seconds to form and looking at the unmoving demon I knew I had enough time.\n[Ding!]\n[Weekly Requirement:- 2800/1200]\n[Due to the surplus host being granted a bonus reward other than the basic ones.]\n[Does the host want to open the bonus?]\n[Yes/No]\nBeing questioned about something related to rewards, I did what I usually do.\n'No, throw it in inventory.'\nSighing I looked back at the towering figure of the humanoid golem-like creature whose whole body was made up of sandstone and the only aesthetic visible was its two ruby eyes, which currently was fixed upon the hero.\nThe receiver of such gaze was panting heavily because of the attack he used on me and also the heavy pressure he was receiving from the golem.\n'Ah, it's been long since I let loose.'\nCracking my neck, I jerked my legs before a heavy breath smoked out my mouth.\nFocusing my eyes on the thing, I activated my first skill in this whole half year.\n'Gravity Manipulation'.\nMy feet rose in the air before I started ascending at a furious pace. It took me less than ten seconds before I climbed around 70 feet in height and now was matched with the eyes of the demon in front.\nStrangely or not, the creature was still fixated on the hero which slightly irritated me but it's not like I unwelcomed it.\nSoon my spell was in its dischargeable form covering my both palms with amber shade. With the temperature, I had right now at my disposal I could even evaporate a whole pond in seconds.\nNaturally, I didn't feel anything from it, but it doesn't mean, my enemy would feel the same as me.\nCirculating mana in my desired direction I shot toward the demon's head. Just when I reached some meter away from the demon's forehead I twirled abort and using the inertia landed my palm with more ferocity.\n[Touch of Inferno]\n**TINGGG**\nImmediately where my hand touched the demon a loud vibration formed sending waves into the monster before I finally found the result of my labor.\n**BOOM**\nHalf of the crown of the demon's head was obliterated with chunks of rocks falling on the ground.\nThe sound was so loud and vibrant that it shook the surroundings and finally the demon also got interested in my presence.\nSurprisingly or not, the place which I broke just now regenerated immediately before I found a huge sculptured hand coming in my way.\n'Fuck...is he taking me as an insect or something...?'\nI dodged the hand flawlessly and used the same technique with my other hand on the rock demon. But same as the previous time it went futile.\n'Since small attacks work on you...'\nI made some distance from myself and the demon before I initiated another spell.\nMy mana without [Limiters] was high enough for me to fight with high-rank spells for a day or two. But still, I didn't want to let this continue more than necessary because of various reasons.\nA huge black and crimson shade of blaze formed on top of my raised index finger. The size of it was the same as a two-story house with heat that could burn a small village without extinguishing even after annihilation.\nI was using such high-class spells because I knew the monstrosity in front was nothing to take easy about so I went with my best.\n[Hell Blaze]\nI launched the attack toward the monster, who this time moved properly and not only with a sway of hand but it actually protected its face with both arms in guard.\nMy advantage was that the thing was made of sand, well not entirely but enough for me to devise my plan.\nThe hell blaze contains the heat of about 4000°C and when that temperature meets the sand, one thing happens...\n\"GUOOOOHHNHHH\"\nThe demon's hands were shifted into a liquid state due to the effect of the blaze. I seized the moment and applied my other spell.\n[Cetus]\nAt my command, a huge creature made of pure aqua emerged on top of my head before I pushed it onto the golem before it could flail anywhere else.\nThe natural phenomena worked and the liquid magma was cooled with the steam of hot gasses leaving the demon's arms.\nThe growls and agony of the Terror potential demon were resonating heavily to the point where my ears were going numb but I couldn't just sit back when I finally got the chance to hurt something finally with my full capability.\n'Yes, this is it...'\nAfter the steam was blown what came was a pure prismatic crystal which was reflecting some of the daylight diverting in seven different shades.\nThe demon was also fascinated by such sight even though it was the one who was getting toyed with.\nI didn't waste my time and using gravity manipulation, I accelerated my speed in a whole different league with my fist clenched in a tight grip.\n'Let's end this!!'\n[Titan Thrust]\nUsing my body as a spear with my held fist as its tip, I breached through the arms of the demon shattering the glass on my way, before my attack was met the place where the core of the demon resided.\nIn between its eyes where I knew would be the end of this battle and as I expected my knowledge wasn't just a hunch.\n**CLINNNG**\n**CREAK**\nA cracking sound erupted with the impact before I felt something crystalline breaking inside the tough surface of the demon.\nIn place of a loud cry, I heard nothing from the monster after I broke its core. Only its heavy body that was falling in my direction made me realize that I won this battle without taking single damage at all.\nMy eyes went a little wide when a sudden realization hit me hard.\n'Ain't I too OP now...?'\n__________________\n[Venessa's POV:]\n'What the hell just happened...?'\nIn front of my eyes, human's greatest nemesis, a demon and a high class at that rose and fell in a single hour.\nA [Terror Ranked] demon was something I could not even dream of facing with my current strength nor I was confident of winning even if I was to fight with my whole team including Kyouki-san.\nA monster that could bring chaos to a whole capital surely sounds highly tough to defeat, yet I saw its fall right with my own eyes.\nSince the time I felt the space around me changing and this humongous creature rising from nowhere, a sense of death surrounded me with my will to even flinch leaving my soul.\nI was ready for a gruesome death along with my comrades and looking at Kyouki-san's expression it was inevitable for us to get crushed here, yet something miraculous happened.\nThe person who should have been dead by now suddenly used levitation so brilliantly that I started doubting whether he was only using a Magic stone or did he have any artifact.\nBut his levitation wasn't the only thing that left me speechless.\nThe high-rank spell he used, the versatility he showed in the one-sided battle, and the sheer determination which backed his confront blows made my mind go numb.\nI mean from what I remember he was only a single element user yet he was using two different elements consecutively and High rankers at that.\nI was astonished beyond belief.\nI have beaten him a couple of times in the past because of the vulgar comments and deeds he tried upon me and my comrades, but he never countered with any spell at those times. And that strength he displayed at the end was nothing I could compare myself to.\n[....%?@?&%....]\nWait, was he holding back all these times when he could have wiped us with a single spell?\n[℅®℅XX©℅&%@#@%]\nBut why did he showcase something like this today, when he clearly could have run away and left us to die here?\n[%℅℅€%@&%%@&%]\nWas it his plotting? Was he the one who called that creature to win our trust and become the hero!?\n[....%&X....]\nYes, it must be that!\nHe must have wanted to show that he was more powerful than Kyouki-san so he could win over us and become the hero of humanity when he was the one who we should be terminating first.\nClenching my fist I bit my lips hard until a thick liquid didn't dye my taste buds as I stared at the haughty bastard who was clearly celebrating his fake victory with a disgusting smug plastered on his shitty face.\n'Seriously, how low can you fall, you treacherous Austin Wright!!'\n___________________\nA/N:- Ah, some drama would be arriving and the commencement of the true story. And yeah don't worry I would add a lot of fluff shortly in the story.\nRemember Austin never uses System's reward because of his righteous foolish thought process, which the evil Luna would break and make him go super OP in the future too.\nPlease support me on Ko-fi if you want regular chapters as I have to delay my work so I could write.\nAnd do stop by the comment section tho...~",

      "content": "'Ah'\nPainful inaudible grunt left my lips as I twisted my forearm which gave a crisp sound given my physical condition after I received the blow from the hero. It wasn't hurting much but still except for my face I was like living charcoal right now. Thanks to the spell-weaved school uniform that I wasn't butt naked right now.\n'Ah, here it goes'.\nAfter I defeated the demon in the jungle, the [Curse Veil] naturally got disrupted, and when it did, the bearded old man who also happened to be the headmaster of the academy, came toward the scene at a furious pace.\nIt was to be expected as the band Kyouki was wearing was severed slightly and since the veil was prohibiting anyone to come inside the whole school was in an uproar.\nSeeing the greatest embodiment of Light trembling so profoundly on the ground like his soul have been sucked out of him, the audience which came to see him was highly stressed.\nKyouki's harem members also seemed to be in a great grief as they were crying and wailing floods upon seeing his state.\nI never spotted Luna since the time I left her at the start of the expedition. I expected her to be with Kyouki again if things were to happen as I thought, but surprisingly she was just like disappeared from the face of the earth.\nNow, who was left was me and the fallen demon who was getting inspected, and I...\n....was getting interrogated.\n\"A [Terror Rank] demon erupted out of nowhere and you who are still struggling to break through your Novice rank defeated it? Even children's fairy tail would sound more believable than this.\"\nThe one who entirely disdained me with his high and mighty tone was one of the council officers who govern the school from the sidelines and was the link that connects the academy and the main capital.\nNot only him, the other 10 council members, 48 instructors, and professors along with the [Saint Rank] Headmaster Merlin were present in the Principal office.\nI was sitting solemnly on a chair while being weighed by those many stares who were trying to figure out the lie which I never told.\n\"Since there were four witnesses who saw it happening, we can't deny that Austin has defeated that thing in the jungle, but the fact a demon appeared out of nowhere is still highly concerning\".\nThe headmaster was somewhat level-headed but the problem was I didn't want them to know that I defeated the demon as it would only become a pain in the ass.\nFortunately, they were more focused on the topic of how it happened not how it ended.\nUpon hearing the headmaster's call, everyone seemed to drown in their deep thought which thankfully didn't concern me.\nI was just waiting for everyone to know that demon never went away and the hero was the trigger that awakened its sleep from slumber. That's all.\nBut it wasn't like I could tell them knowing the fact that I shouldn't have much knowledge about demons in the first place, but flipping all my overthinking thoughts, someone unexpected brought a solution to this unwelcoming situation.\n\"I know how all this happened !!\"\nShouted at top of her lungs was the red-headed warrior hero of the academy, Venessa Charles, and the person who despise me most in Kyouki's harem just because I don't engage in combat.\nWell now maybe Lilia hates me most...or...maybe Luna...?\nMy internal monologue was broken as the boot clanking on the floor echoed in the room attracting every gaze toward the sudden intruder.\n\"Do you know how this happened student?\"\nOne of the council members raised from his seat in anxiety as he asked the girl who was glaring daggers at me. I knew something was misunderstood but my hazy mind wasn't capable to discern anything at the moment so I just went with the flow.\n\"Yes, I know who brought that calamity upon us and made Kyouki-san like that.\"\nEven the headmaster became serious as he supported his chin on his intervened fingers before leaning forward on his table.\nThe whole room was dead silent and waiting for the next word that Venessa would be saying as it would probably decide what course of the brutal act they would be bestowed upon the preparator.\n'Ah, this is hectic'.\n\"The sole person in this whole campus who's able to use curse energy and the person who intentionally brought that demon on the surface so he could show his fake might and get accepted as a hero, is none other than the shameful human trash, Austin Wright.\"\n______________________\n'Finally, it ended.'\nSteadily walking to my dorm I sighed in weariness.\nSince I was labeled as a demon cult follower, naturally they would have caged me up and slaughtered me mercilessly.\nBut it wasn't like I could just accept anything thrown at me, so I made my point that I wasn't a demon worshipper.\nIt took me time but they finally accepted my plea only on the condition that I would get through a baptizing which the Pope of the capital would partake in two days from now.\nIt would eventually prove whether I was lying or Venessa misunderstood the whole situation.\nUntil then I was banned from classes and also was ordered to remain inside my dorm whatever happens or I would be labeled as a criminal or something.\nSeriously, fighting like this for the first time in my life really did exhaust me so I nodded whatever they said just so I could get out of that depressing place.\nFinally, my heavy steps reached my private quarter before I spotted my maid standing at the front gate with anxiety plastered all over her pretty face.\nI naturally got out of my daze before I fastened my feet and asked with a frown.\n\"What happened Carol?\"\nThe maid who usually stayed emotionless and cold-faced all the time was panicking like this meant only a few things, and expectedly my hunch was right.\n\"Young master...Lord Vincent has come to visit you.\"\nMy eyes widened in shock as I heard the name of my dad attached to visiting me. He never in this half-year contacted me even though many of my complaints traveled to the town I come from.\nThe all-time busy Count visiting me at such a sudden time of year meant only one thing...\n'He got the news of that incident.\nMerely four hours have passed since that incident yet my father was here proved two things.\nFirst, he had one of the professors or staff as his spy, and given my father's position, it wasnt surprising much at all.\nSecond. To come at such a short time from such a long distance meant he used [Teleportation ] which wasnt commonly used by even high nobles, which signified how furious he was.\nI gulped unconsciously as I thought of such a thing as even though I have done so many things past this year I never have come across my parent's anger.\nNot to make him wait long I immediately went inside while checking my attire a little. Pulling my collar to hide my burnt skin I knocked on the door twice before I went inside.\n\"G-good afternoon, father.\"\nStood silently with his wide back facing me was undoubtedly the person whome I regarded as my parent in this life.\nCount Vincent was a Knight Commander in the First Order of Capital in the past, so he usually spent his time on the field rather than at office work.\nDue to his rigorous work in a battleground and the numerous experience he has gone through, his whole aura oozed with dignity and danger.\nThe mountain build which was adorned with cuts and bruises spreaded on his face finally turned toward my direction as the two narrowed eyes of my father landed upon me.\nI visibly shuddered a little as I concluded that he was far from pleased to see me after this long, but I stood still with my head lowered.\n\"I heard about the incident.\"\nHis heavy voice resonated in the room even though he was just stating things in his normal tone.\nKnowing already his reason to visit I didn't express any kind of reaction and waited for his next word which probably would be punishment for my unverified deeds.\nWalking toward the sole big chair inside the room he sat on it before continuing.\n\"Since your birth, we never expected nor raised any hope from you. Do you know the reason for it ?\"\nBeing asked about the reason why I was treated partially than my elder siblings for the first time, I was a little startled but nevertheless, I replied with my head still leaning down.\n\"No, father. I am not aware of it.\"\nAfter a brief pause, he continued.\n\"When you came into this world a prophecy was bestowed upon you. The foresight was, that there would be a day when you'll become the greatest enemy of humanity. To change your destiny there wasnt anything in our capability we could have done except for killing you. But neither I nor Sophia had the heart to kill the offspring we brought in this world.\"\nThroughout his explanation, I was dead and froze at my place with beads of sweat forming over my whole face and eyes at their widest range.\nProphecies weren't something to scoff about in this world and if I foresaw the way father was telling me, then I was thankful for how kindly they treated me until now.\nBut the problem was how such a thing was prophesied when I didn't have such strength or intention to go against my own kind in the first place.\n'Wait...is it related to the system...?'\nThis conclusion was the only resort I landed upon as in my sane mind I would never do the thing which I hate the most.\n\"Until now whatever you did, I never meddled in that but today you showed what I feared the most. You became the thing I could never accept or associate myself with. Fortunately, neither I and my wife nor my children grew any feeling for you, or else we would have only regretted it at this point in life.\"\nI knew what he was telling me was not all true as I wasnt a demon cult follower, but would it matter even if I tell him?\nBeing disdained and loathed since birth seemed to hurt but now when I know the reason for it..it still is hurting.\nDoing my best to hold myself together I just stood silently waiting for him to finish.\n\"I never told you what to do as I could not restrict your actions. But there's one thing I could do which would save the name of my family from any future shame. Do you know what is it?\"\nMy body jerked slightly as I held my face upward and looked at the man wide-eyed trying to not believe what he just meant and wishing that today was nothing but a dream.\nBut nothing goes as one wishes...\nAfter my father rose from his seat he walked toward me, before he started to speak his conclusion which might change my life forever.\n\"From this day on, I, Vincent Wright, cease the authority of you to attach my family's title with your name. From this very moment, you are no longer part of the Wright family.\"\nSince there was no way to turn the decision that the Count stated, I could just accept my fate.\nControlling all my emotions which were making my vision blurry and mind hazy I only replied in a single word, before the person I previously called father, left my room and my life forever.\n\"Understood.\"\n_____________\n[Carol's POV:]\nI was walking to and fro around the door where young master Austin walked in some minutes ago.\nI knew there would be consequences for the blames the young master has been charged with, but the Count visiting himself was still out of my expectations.\nI was well aware of my young master's deeds for which he was getting tormented by the whole academy and also scorned by his own blood relatives, but there was something which was telling me young master wasnt involved in this matter at all.\nHe could be mischievous and a problem creator but being a criminal, I highly doubt such thought.\nEven though he has used various means to torment me in the past, it doesn't mean I could see him the way,  others were assuming him.\n**Click**\nSuddenly the door was clicked open before the patriarch walked out of the room.\nI immediately lowered my head and stood by the wall. His steps audibly came near me but contrary to my expectation he didn't walk away but stood just in front.\n\"Pack your luggage and along with other servants return to the main residence before tomorrow morning.\"\nMy closed eyes shot open as I heard him loud and clear but before even I could have raised my head, Lord Vincent already walked away.\nI gawked at his back with my mind repeating his words and thinking about the reason why he asked me and the others to return when the young master's academic year was still in progress.\n'No way...'\nAs soon as a clear conclusion formed in my mind, I was already in a rush toward the young master's room.\n**Click**\n\"Young master!!\"\nMy previous unsettling thoughts shifted to dread as I saw the naked upper body of the young master who currently was changing his uniform.\nHis whole upper body was burnt with every cell of his body in its worse condition. Even though I wasnt the one who was injured, looking at his current state I couldn't help but cringe in a fret.\n\"Ah, Carol. Sorry for this unsightly appearance.\"\nHe was more embarrassed to show me this sight of his rather than being pained about such physicality.\nLarge drops of tears subconsciously formed at the corner of my eyes as I walked forward to help him wear the coat that he was having difficulty putting on because of his condition\n\"Thank you for the help, Carol. So you coming here in such a rush means my fa- I mean Sir Vincent has already asked you to return to the main residence,  right?\"\nMy hazy mind was so clouded after seeing him that I was only able to discern some of his words which also contained how he referred to Lord Vincent as.\nMy doubt was cleared at that very moment which didn't help but made tears from my eyes fall even more.\n\"Y-young...master...w-why..di-\"\nMy words were interrupted by the young master as he brought his hand toward my face and gently wiped my tears.\n\"Why didn't I retort my charges and told him the truth? Well, to be honest, it doesn't matter anymore Carol. Count Vincent just needed a cause to disown me, so not now but anytime soon he would have done what he did today.\"\nHis words were reaching me yet I wasnt able to comprehend anything. I was continuously weeping while getting pampered by the young master who never had touched me so gently before.\nI didn't know what happened suddenly to him. It might be because of this sudden visit of Count, but I could not find the same young master in him, whome I always loathed.\nIn front of my eyes was only an innocent teenage boy whose beautiful yet grieving eyes clearly told me how defeated he was feeling right now.\nBut I couldn't do anything for him now when I never even looked at him properly since I was assigned to serve him.\nI felt so pathetic...\n\"Y-*sniff* young master..\"\n\"Don't cry like this Carol when we are about to separate. It will only leave a bad taste afterward. Here take this...\"\nSuddenly he brought a heavy pouch out of nowhere before he took my hand and placed it on top of it.\n\"It's the earning I have saved from my adventurer work.\".\nMy eyes went wide as I again felt the bag and indeed it had coins inside which by weight seemed a lot.\n\"I can't accept this young master...!\"\nI immediately tried to return it as in the first place for the work I have done I should only have received his usual taunts. Being rewarded like this didn't help but made my heart heavy.\n\"You deserve it, Carol. To be honest in these 18 months with you, I have felt alive and needed more than ever. You gave me the warmth I ever desired and yet I returned it in such a disgusting way previously.\"\nHis face suddenly took a regretful smile as he directed his words. Looking at his expression I thought about whether I really knew the young master.\nBecause in front of me, there wasnt the haughty prince I have been with this short time, but only a pure teenage boy who was confessing his wrongdoings and trying to do his best to compensate for his deeds.\nHow could I help but not feel moved by this...?\nHonestly facing the previous young master who never spoke to me with a straight face, seemed easier than this honest young master who was making my heart sink and drowns in endless regret.\n\"Young master...cant I stay with you...?\"\nUpon hearing me he shook his head in all seriousness before her reminding me of what I had nearly forgotten because of my emotional breakdown.\n\"You mustn't Carol. Your family has been indebted to the Wright family which even you want, you couldn't get rid of. Leaving the family just for the sake of me is far from sensible, so don't even think about it .\"\nI nodded stiffly with my head hung low as possible as my face was miserable enough to not let show in front of my young master.\nSuddenly my both hand were held by the young master before his gentle voice reached my senses as his words which I might not be able to forget ever, got engraved inside my mind and soul.\n\"Okay then, Carol. Even if it was for a short while I was happy that I got to know you and got served by you. I know I didn't play a good role as your master but please remember this, in this life I don't think I would have ever found a maid better than you. Thank you for being with me until now, Carol.\"\n_________________\n**Ding**\n'Hmm... it's already midnight?'\nI looked at the clock which had the needles aligned and pointing to zero hour.\nCarol and the other servants which have been serving me, left the dorm some hours ago since they had to return to the main mansion before morning.\nI didn't meet Carol when she was departing as I knew my presence would only hurt her and also it would pain me too, to see a dear person leaving my side.\nBut there wasn't anything I could do.\nI was disowned by my family and had my surname snatched in just an instance.\nEven though I never felt accepted in that family, still being told so directly that I no longer was their son nor the youngest brother of my siblings anymore, filled my heart with bitterness.\nI no longer was crying as I was since evening. My skin has long lost regenerative capability because I didn't use any kind of potion on it, but I was in no mind to get concerned about it. I was a complete mess all over.\nMaybe I was overthinking things, but it was so long since I felt this lonely in this world.\nIn my previous life, I still had a person who cared for me and always stayed by my side whatever happened.\nBut in this life, I never built a relationship that I didn't sever with my own hands.\nThe family I was gifted with in this life never thought of me as their own.\nThe person whome I vowed to live forever with also cut ties with me because of the way I treated her.\nThe first maid I had in my life and who genuinely cared for my well-being also had to go away because of certain actions of mine.\nAnd also the person whome despite being the center of attention of millions of people, tried to get closer to me, and grew distant from me because of some unreasonable reasons and my own selfishness.\nI might be whining right now but these thoughts were something I could not suppress as I desire.\nI just needed someone with whom I can share my grief ...\nSomeone who cares for me and someone whome I can make smile...\nSomeone I can wholeheartedly show my affection for and receive the same....\n...someone whome I can love and feel being loved..\nI just...\nNeed...\nSomeone...\n...\n...\n\"What will you do without me, you poor child.\"\nSuddenly I heard a familiar feminine voice of a person just some inches from my back.\nEven without turning, I knew who she was just from her peculiar fluorescent but I had to turn my head to confirm that my anxious mind wasn't making delusions.\nThere stood the most beautiful person I have ever come across in my life, currently standing with a helpless smile adorning her moon-white face which seemed to shine even more under the dim light of the room.\nMy world which was getting darker passing each second seemed to lighten up just with her mere presence. I couldn't help but smile foolishly upon seeing her before my choked throat pushed only a single word out of my mouth.\n\"Luna\".\n_______________________\nA/N:- Ah, this was long.\nThe main story of the MC transforming into a villain would start now onwards.\nRemember he won't be a crazy ass villain who would slaughter innocent mindlessly but more like an anti-hero who would manipulate scenes for his selfishness and slap those who would torment him.\nAnyway, I would upload 5 chapters in advance on Patreon so check it out and also please consider a donation on Ko-fi if you are liking my story~",

      "content": "People say those men who cry are weak-willed but in my perception, those men who cry are the most genuine people.\nIt wasn't like I haven't seen men cry before me for various reasons, but when the person I care for, wept his grief wordlessly while being dependent upon me, I felt very delighted for being needed by the person.\nNot to boast, but many people would love to be with me, but I never found anyone worthy enough of my attention because of the greed they carry for me.\nLust and Power was the most common sin I was targeted with by the populace which made my heart solid rock and my resolve clear that whatever happens, I would never fall for anyone.\nYet when I saw a certain man who was hurting himself time after time, getting targeted by most of the people around him and loathed by these many people, just because of the fake act of a haughty noble he shows in front of everyone, but in reality, he was just a pure innocent boy. I felt my heart warming up a little.\nIt wasn't because of the weird thing I got to know about him, but the reason he was doing such. Well, spying on someone wasn't something I prefer but when it's about the person I was interested in for the first time, I just couldn't help it.\nMy heart was moved beyond belief. I was so much swept by the actions that being used by him as he desired didn't feel much of a deal, but only to the point where he wasn't hurting himself.\nBut when his plans brought him into such a pitiful state I decided to finally come out of the shadows and cooperate with him without holding anything.\nIt might be the first time I was getting involved in something so wholeheartedly yet I was loving the way I was thinking and behaving these days.\nI felt alive for him and wanted to live for his sake...\nI just only need him now...\n\"So what are you going to do from now?\"\nGliding my hand across his fluffy hair, I asked Austin who was currently laying on my lap like a cute baby.\nAt the start he was reluctant but as soon I persuaded him with the teary eye technique I have practiced during these four days, he accepted everything I asked him to.\nWell, asking him everything at this point would be a rushing thing so I only restricted myself from being intimate with him like this.\nWho knows about the future...\n\"I will go through this baptize or whatever they want me to, and continue my daily life as a pretend villain.\"\nSaying so he closed his eyes when I suddenly asked the thing which was hurting my stomach for a very long.\n\"But why do you have to behave like that Austin? Is there any personal goal of yours behind it?\"\nHe clearly heard me as his eyes went wide open before he looked at me in shock. He abruptly got up from my lap making me all lonely, before he rejected my question.\n\"N-no such thing could be possible. Don't spout nonsense all of a sudden \".\nHis stutter was everything to tell me that he was presenting me with a white lie. I held his arm tightly in my embrace before I looked at him with a pained expression.\n\"Won't you tell me, Austin-sama? Ain't I a person trustable enough?\nI purposely blinked repeatedly to show my pitiful expression which my past self probably would have died seeing such, from embarrassment.\nAustin turned a deep red before he snatched his eyes away shyly. I doubted such a runaway strategy, yet again I also wouldn't have let him tell such an important thing without giving him some kind of assurance.\nI closed my eyes and using the Holy Magic, created a contract that was regarded as the [Promisery Vow]. While I was at it, I also engraved the content required to be followed and the name of the parties.\nOpening my eyes there was a faded brownish paper levitating in mid-air which was giving a faint purple glow ensuring that the content was written and the final acceptance was only required.\nLooking back at my partner, I saw his eyes a little wide but from his not-so-amused expression, it seemed he knew what it was.\n\"I think you have an idea what it is, so I will go into the contract detail only .\"\nI handed him the paper as I started to dictate the clauses I have included in the contract.\n\"This contract prohibits the remarked party, from spouting anything which would be discussed in this room. The one who would be breaking the promise would have to compensate with their life. Now, is it okay to let you know my trustability, Sir Austin?\"\nI asked him while tilting my head and a natural smile across my face. Despite hearing me the caution prince still went through the whole contract before he asked me something.\n\"Hey, Luna....it only says the one who made the contract can't talk things outside. It doesn't include me...did you make a mistake .\"\nShaking my head left to right I made his doubt clear.\n\"Of course not. I mean, how can I let my precious Austin get in danger with this contract? This contact is something you need to trust me so don't think about the useless stuff and fill out the form.\"\nHe pondered for quite a while before he finally seemed to let go of his reluctance as a defeated sigh left his lips before he pinched his lower lip and kissed the contract as in to fulfill the acceptance.\n'Oof...how lucky...'\n\"I don't why I am telling you all this or what would happen if someone was to know what I am going to tell you, but somehow I feel I can't escape from you, can I?\"\nI shook my head without hesitation with my eyes crescent in elation.\nI was glad that he knew I was a heavy woman whome he couldn't get rid of.\n\"Okay then... let's start from the start. I know my story would sound pure bullshit but please don't try to laugh in between okay?\"\nI nodded and immediately faced him properly with my legs going crisscrossed on his warm bed.\nHis eyes wandered at my exposed legs for a bit but soon he snatched them away. Well, it would have been better if he had stared at them all he wanted but of course, I could not say it, just like that.\nHis heavy breath seemed to calm down a little as he took a little time to collect his thoughts before he faced me and drew his eyes directly on top of me. I felt a little tremble running down my spine but looking at his serious expression I knew it wasn't time to flirt, so I kept my mouth shut.\n\"The fact is ...I-I actually am a reincarnated...\"\nAnd his story started from the time he died and was born in this world. He told how things were different from his previous world, and how he lived before he found this thing called the 'Villain System'.\nI reminded myself to keep on giving him a shocked expression from time to time but in reality, I wasn't surprised at all.\nHow can I be when I actually knew all these things since four days ago when I sneakily read his mind when he was asleep?\nWell, the night I saw his memory for the first time in my life I felt my Spell broken. It was too much for me to digest. For a second I thought all these memories of Austin were just made up and I was getting deceived.\nBut I knew very well what my Spells were capable of and aligning with the fact upon how Austin have behaved until now and the girl he was watching on that blue stone which was literally known as 'Smartphone' in his last life, I was sure that all these memories of Austin were a complete truth.\nIt took me almost 12 hours to digest all the information I saw in those memories.\nGetting to know that I actually was a fictional character drawn on pieces of paper in Austin's last life's reality, made me feel insecure about my privacy.\nBut I knew it was all my thinking. The theory of the multiverse wasn't proven but it was unheard of.\nI memorized everything and concluded why Austin's behavior was like that even though he clearly was forcing himself. From that day onwards my slight interest in Austin turned into a complete attraction or to say  I was on the verge to be called obsessed with him.\nKnowing how hard his life have went until now and how lonely he was, the instinct of being his sole support ignited inside of me.\nThe reason I didn't kill the trash with the surname Sudou today, was because I knew Austin's villain system would collapse as soon I end the foolish hero, that's why I decided to stay hidden.\nIt was hard to believe something like System and reincarnation in reality but in the face of Austin, I could accept anything.\n...\n\"So that's how is it. Until one month I have to pretend like a villain so I can save Saya, my sister, and get a normal life.\"\nAs I have seen he narrated everything perfectly except for the fact that he have seen this world in his previous life through a comic book.\nWell, it wasn't that I could just confess now that I knew things he didn't tell me about, as it would make Austin wary of me, and also it would feel I was making fun of him by giving such reactions, so I held back my urge.\n\"This person Saya...was she close to you Austin?\"\nI knew the person from Austin's memory but how close they were was still not clear that's why I asked. Not like I was annoyed about her being dearest to him as that pitiful child was fighting death as we talk here now.\nYes, I was definitely not jealous of that little girl even Austin showed such a warm gaze when I asked about her.\nI am definitely not...\n\"Saya huh. You can say that I was alive and moving forward in the last 20 years of my life was just because of her. Even though she was just a neighbor of mine she was close to me like a sister and always cared about my well-being. She always saved her pocket money to help with my necessities. She even saved her birthday cake and sneaked out a huge piece of it for me, so I can have such delicacy once every year. To say how much a person could grow close to someone, then for me and Saya we couldn't define. I think my love for her could not grow any more than it actually is.\"\nSince childhood, I was a very calm and silent child who never got agitated even though someone was taunting me right to my face.\nBut hearing him, I feel all my past accumulated anger was wailing up and releasing out altogether.\nI was constantly suppressing my mana so it doesn't go berserk and eventually hurt Austin while I heard his sweet words flowing out for his good sister.\nHmm..sister...?\n'Yeah, she is just a sister and not even a person of this world ...why should I fear her? Fufufu...I was just worrying needlessly.'\n\"Um...Luna, are you okay?\"\nSuddenly being asked like that I fell out of my dark side as I nodded subconsciously.\n\"Y-yeah...I wasn't thinking anything insidious so continue.\"\nI wiped the sweat off my forehead as I said my honest thoughts.\nIt seemed Austin went speechless for some reason as he started stuttering before he jerked all of a sudden as he asked me something which for a long time made me tongue-tied.\n\"That reminds me. I wanted to ask something for a very long that why Luna has had such a favorable impression of me to the point she forgave me even though I betrayed her? And how come, Luna was able to sneak inside my room like this even though she's just a Holy magic user? I wonder if Luna is also hiding something from me~\"\n**Gulp**\n___________________\nA/N:- Next chapter would be in continuation with the layout of a future prospectus.\nDonate me on Ko-fi if you like my work.\nAnd on your way back please type&post something in the vacant box at the end of the page~",

      "content": "\"To answer the latter part of your query, then I think I have to tell you something about myself first.\"\nSpoken in a dimly lighted room sat the person and me, whom I had been terrified of the most for some days.\nThe person who was once my farm of points suddenly took an interest in me and started noticing those things which I wanted from my ex-fiancee.\nTo be honest, how much I tried to deny her advances and thought that her presence would hinder me in the future, her being with me like this genuinely makes me feel happy.\nI have no such person in this life who, after getting tormented and even betrayed once, would come back to me like a stubborn kid who's reluctant to let go of their parent.\nWell, even though I behave like a kid more than usual in front of her, it doesn't change the fact she returned for me.\nFor her, I was no one. Without me, she wouldn't have lost a single cent, nor being with me would have given her a whole life's fortune, yet she decided to stay by my side for whatever reasons.\nI still was unsure why she was so persistent and understanding with all the stories I had told her about my life until now, but there was one thing I was getting a little scared about.\nI was reborn here, lived as a noble, and acted like an arrogant asshole, yet my heart still belonged to a young adult.\nEven though I had never been in a romantic relationship with someone before, I was very well conscious of those feelings. Being cared for like an apple of the eye, having such a beautiful girl's attention like this made me furiously terrified of something.\nI may be reacting more than I should have, but these were my honest feelings that kept hitting the back of my head since Luna came into this room.\nSuddenly, Luna inhaled deeply as some nervousness visibly surrounded her aura. I was a little tense, too, as the main plot I read in my previous life didn't justify any of the heroine's backstory.\nI just knew that Luna comes from a royal family of far western lands and has been living low-key to achieve her goal without using her family's background.\n\"Austin...please don't hate me when I say it but...I...I am not a human .\"\nAs she said, she opened her oceanic eyes, which were now radiating with a strange glint adorning her precious eyes. Her eyes were looking majestic at the moment.\nI was so immersed in her eyes that I never noticed where she asked me to check.\n\"Mou~Stop staring already~ I'm serious here.\"\nHer pout brought me back on track as I hurriedly put away my gaze with a faint 'Sorry' along the way.\nI never intended to stare at her, but her eyes were so mesmerizing that I think they could fail a succubus in charm.\n'Hmm'\nMy averted eyes finally glimpse the place she was trying to show me earlier.\nHer hands, which in the normal situation should be silky white in the shade, were now white, but it was far from humanly.\nShe was practically illuminating. Her arms up to her elbows were glowing with serene porcelain white light like it was covered with some kind of oceanic fluid.\n\"Th-This..\"\nI was so flabbergasted that I never saw Luna's expression and asked while still trying to figure out what I was facing at the moment.\n\"As you can see, my humanity has been taken from me in exchange for a blessing I was granted with at my toddler's age. The reason I can use different spells and can handle mana so easily is this.\"\nI heard her and found myself amazed thoroughly. From what I saw in the manga, Luna never showed any sign of being a god Apostle or sort of whatever situation arose.\nEven in the face of the heaviest punishment or most incredible pain, she always remained the same like Holy Magic was the only thing she was taught.\nBut suddenly, that same Luna was showing something like a change in her whole trait and diverting her from the original self.\nIt sure would thrill me enough to stare at her hand like an idiot.\nBut I guess I was insulting her like that since she snatched her hands away not so long after.\n\"Sorry for showing you something like that. I know it looks disgusting.\"\nHer dry laugh at the end and the way her beautiful eyes lost their shine made my brows frown and my heart clench in slight pain.\nI hurriedly held her hand, which she was trying to retract, which made her subconsciously widen her eyes toward me.\n\"Aus-..\"\n\"Don't make something up with your own assumption. Neither I am disgusted nor do you have to say sorry for anything. Rather than disgust, the only emotion I have right now is amazement and attraction toward these beautiful hands of yours. I might be sounding cringy, but these are my honest thoughts. Please don't reject my emotions like this.\"\nI held her hand rigidly in my grip as I muttered all my mind out to let her know how I felt about these discoveries about her.\nTo tell the truth, I felt gratified to know something which Luna hadn't told many people, or maybe I was the only one.\n\"A-are you s-serious...Austin...you aren't making fun of me, right...?\"\nHearing her staggering voice, I couldn't help but sigh in my heart. It was the first time I had seen Luna in a such terrified state.\nI didn't know she held me this close, that my opinion would make her scared.\nHolding her hand gently with my left one, I lifted my other arm and brought it over Luna's head before I started caressing her softly.\n\"Don't even think that I am making fun of you. I am indeed a little surprised right now as it's the first time I have seen something like this, but it's just that. As I said, these hands of yours and the eyes you showed me some moments ago only shouted one thing in mind; you know what is it?\"\nHer eyes blinked in innocence, and her small pouty lips shrank like a cute baby. Upon hearing my remark, she meekly shook her head while staring at me in astonishment.\nBringing my hand toward her fluffy cheeks, a smile formed on my lips before the word came out of my mouth, which I always think whenever I look at Luna.\n\"Beautiful.\"\nHer dormant eyes shone more brightly than ever before as she stretched them at their widest point. Her mouth became slightly ajar, as it seemed she was trying to say something but failing miserably.\nInvoluntarily a chuckle left my lips which made her come back to life again as she again pouted with her cheeks puffed to the fullest before grabbing my hand roughly.\n\"Stop playing with me!!\"\n\"Ah.\"\nSuddenly Luna jumped over me, making us fall on the bed in intimate proximity. The distance between our bodies became non-existent with her head draped over my chest, and almost all of her body pressed over me.\nThe softness and heat I felt all over me was something I might never be able to define with mere words. But in contrast to what I was feeling right now, it would be heavens beyond belief.\nHer intoxicating fragrance, which was so peculiar that I could now identify her presence without looking at her, was overwhelming in the air right at the moment.\nI have hugged women in the past, but the heat of Luna's body supplying me wasn't even comparable to the warmth I had felt from someone else.\nIt wasn't uncomfortable. Far from it. More like I had never felt comfort this much before, to the point where my natural embarrassment, which should have flared up being in this position, never showed any sign of rising.\nStrangely, this feeling was so solacing that I thought all my worries disappeared instantly\n\"It's comfortable hugging me, right?\"\nWith her eyes narrowed in mischief, Luna asked me with her chin supported by my upper body.\nAs she said, I indeed was hugging her waist like I didn't want to let go of her at all. I immediately retracted my hand before I apologized.\n\"Sorry, but it's too comfortable for me to resist-\"\nSuddenly Luna grabbed the arm which was previously on her back before she muttered something to exhaust all my reasonings.\n\"Who told you to resist? Enjoy the moment, and don't let such formal thoughts hinder your desires.\"\nHer words felt genuine, or maybe my mind was clouded enough to let me believe they were her honest thoughts of hers as I brought my hand back on her waist and snuggled even more closely than before.\nI have been near a person of the opposite gender before,  but being in such an intimate situation with such otherworldly beauty was my first time through and through.\nIt was an unreal feeling.\nThe room soon fell silent as the sound of two hearts beating resonated in my senses vividly, with faint, heavy breaths coming just some inches below.\nThis serene silence with such a blissful cuddle made my mind blank for some moment until Luna brought me out of my stupor.\n\"Hey, Austin...\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nI hummed with my eyes still closed as I heard her slightly unusual, tensed tone.\n\"Don't let others hurt you anymore.\"\nMy eyes slightly parted as I tried to see her expression, but due to our current posture, I could only see her silver hair as her face was drowned on my chest.\n\"Please don't let others wound you anymore. I know I am in no position to say it, but seeing you like that, hurts me. I understand why you are doing such, but please don't let anyone give you such misery again. Won't you listen to me for this once, please?\"\nHer almost weeping sound caught me off guard as, for a moment, the thought of abandoning all my Villain system arose inside.\nBut soon, I slapped down such thoughts, and for some time, I only calmed my raging heart, which, after hearing such a fragile voice, was beating like an uncontrollable beast.\nIt wasn't the thing she said that tempted me. Instead, it was just her tone that, for even a blink, made me lose all my sanity.\nI soon calmed down a little before I held her shoulders gently, and while straightening my back, I made her sit down just some inches apart from me.\nLooking at her sad eyes, I couldn't help but sigh in worry and admiration at how beautiful she could look with any side of hers.\n\"You know I can't stop being a Villain until I don't fulfill the wish I desire the most right? Even if you ask me, Luna, it's beyond impossible for me to leave the role and start a new life now.\"\nI told her what was true. Even after a month when my wish for curing my sister would be fulfilled, I was sure that returning to everyday life would not be possible because of the shitty behavior I had showcased until now.\nHonestly, I was thinking of returning to my family mansion and help father in his work, but now that option has also resigned from the front. So being an adventurer was my only option.\nBut the following words Luna said pulled my full attention, which was getting diverting because of my future plans.\n\"Then do what a villain actually does.\"\nI blinked twice in confusion as I stared at her aimlessly, trying to figure out what she had just said.\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"Austin, do you think that being a villain only means getting trampled upon or getting cursed? Do you think if you get crushed by others, then only you would be called a true villain?\"\nEven though her words were a little cruel and disheartening, I nodded in bafflement.\nWhat she said was all true, and that's what I have been following since day one after getting my Villain System a year or so ago.\nBut looking at Luna's exaggerated sigh, I thought there was something she wanted to tell me. Something that would change the path I have been walking and the life I have been leading. Something...\n\"Listen, Austin. From now on, what I am going to tell you would change how you have been treated until now, and not only that, your new self would make the whole Eden Academy know what an actual Villain is capable of. I promise to make you a being whom no one would dare to trample from this day forward.\"\n...which might change my destiny.\n_________________..__\nA/N:- Luna's past would be revealed steadily, and her personality too.\nIf you liked the chapter and are hyped for the next one, then let me know in the comments.

      "content": "In a brightly lighted hall, which has a width of more than 300m and a length double of width, stood tens of people varying in age and appearance.\nBy the background setting, the hall looked like a church because of a couple of white robes-wearing priests who stood by the aisle with solemn expressions on their faces.\nApart from them, some people were wearing black and red robes with the similar logo of a bright eight-stroke sun adorning their uniform.\nThese people mentioned above were the professors and instructors of Eden Academy, where the case of demons was brought up some days ago.\nThe crowd of teachers was standing on a different side from the priest as they stood silently, waiting for the person in question patiently.\nToday, the baptism of the person who was alleged to be associated with demons would be happening in the church.\nThe person who, despite being on the threshold of newbie rank, actually defeated a [Terror Class] demon and also the person who sent the hero of humanity in a state of despair.\nAustin Wright.\nSince the capital partially controlled the school, and the news of demon appearance was by no means small to be concealed, which made the interference of the Capital became inevitable.\nIt goes without saying that if demons started popping up with a student as it's a catalyst when the most crucial resource of humanity was also part of that academy, the Capital wouldn't be relaxing from the sideline.\nTo have a firmer grasp on the situation, a single person was sent by the capital to surveillance the case.\nThe said person is the court magician of the empire and can defeat the headmaster of the Eden Academy if push comes to shove.\nOne of the most talented mages in the world and the most powerful in the nation was currently standing in the corner of the room and was gawking at the scene like a god looking down on puny humans.\nThis specific arrogant behavior of his made the whole surroundings awkward as well as tense.\nApart from the court magician Alex's egoistic behavior, what people feared was his judgment.\nIf, by any chance, Austin proved to be a demon cult follower, then the options of revolution in the Eden Academy would rise higher than most teachers' expectancy.\nIf a student had been studying in the most trusted academy in the nation despite being a follower of the cult, which was the nemesis of humanity, the situation would become severely dangerous to turn blindfolded.\nThere were tens of jobs as well, as reputation was on the line today, solely depending upon the innocence of Austin Wright, who still hasn't made an appearance.\n\"He sure doesn't have a sense of time, does he?\"\nAlex spoke with his eyes curved crescent with a voice clearly signifying how annoyed he was right now, standing up for more than an hour now.\n\"We have sent someone to look out for him.\"\nBeside him stood the white-bearded wizard with a calm expression on his face, completely betraying his unsettling inner distressful storms.\nThe Principal was also well aware of how it would throw black ink on Eden Academy's name if Austin were to be proven to be an evil entity, but he couldn't just have let Austin roam like that.\nBut the unfortunate thing was that the headmaster learned about Count Vincent throwing Austin out of his family name after he announced the baptism.\nIf not for Austin's background, the headmaster would indeed have just kicked Austin out of the school and have asked some people to take care of him afterward, as being a responsible headmaster, he couldn't just let an evildoer wander freely in the world.\nBut nothing could be done now when everything was set up. It was practically impossible for Austin to escape until he was on school grounds, so what now the old man could do was wait for the inevitable.\n**Tap**Tap**\nSuddenly the footstep of a single person resonates in the big hall, naturally attracting every gaze.\nTall, handsome stature, correct walking posture like a bonafide noble, emerald eyes which in one glance could terrify anyone but upon closer look could make one immense in it, coupled with platinum blonde hair was all adorned by a single ex-nobility and the person with the most incredible popularity at the moment.\nAustin walked solemnly without minding the gaze he was getting directed with from different sides of the room.\nHis affinity with mana was more significant than what he had shown until now, so even the Court Magician Alex, along with the headmaster, was hiding from normal perception; Austin was well aware of them.\nDespite being thoroughly surprised to sense such an excellent mana presence in the room, he didn't have any motive to back now.\nAfter what 'she' had asked him to do and taught him in these couple of days, he was sure nothing would go back as it was once he landed his feet in the room.\nAnd strangely, he wasn't scared of it.\nMaybe it was because Luna was on his side, or he was trying to find a suitable person to rely on until now, which Luna took the role of, but there was one thing he was sure of...\n'There's no going back from now on.'\nBeing glared at by numerous teachers with a mixture of disdain and hope comprising those gazes, Austin made his way toward the podium where the prominent priest was standing.\n\"You finally showed up, huh...I thought the name of God made you piss your pants that you ran away.\"\nDespite looking like a calm type of person, the head priest was a vicious man who loved to bitch people in their face, and when the person was a suspect of a demon cult follower, the priest wasn't even holding back at all.\nAustin just shook his head with a sigh displaying how child-like behavior the head priest was showcasing, which made the latter one's veins pop in agitation.\nBut Austin has no intention of playing with the older man when he had another older man to throw into trouble.\n\"Before I turn myself in, I want to talk to the headmaster. If not, then forget about Baptising; I won't even think before bringing another calamity to school.\"\nAustin's words were highly subjective, making the people present in the church gasp audibly with astonishment and subtle fear spreading like a sheet on their faces.\nIt didn't take a genius to guess what 'Calamity' Austin was talking about as something similar to catastrophe recently has appeared in the vicinity.\nThe fear of losing their job amplified; however, the terrifying thought of facing the Terror Class Golem or something similar was heavier than their jobs.\nEven the headmaster was powerful enough to handle a terror class demon, but what if any two of them appear?\nAnd what if a [Mythic Class] suddenly decides to show its face and starts to run havoc among humanity, starting with the Eden Academy?\nEvery being apart from Alex became pale just from the thought of facing Mythic Monsters, which a Hero could only handle. And taking the current power level of Kyouki, the populace couldn't help but sigh in worry.\n**Swish**\nLike a harsh wind, the white beard Wizard appeared in the center of the church. His raven eyes were fixated on the young blonde youth, with visible anger filled in them.\nThe all-time aloof and calm headmaster was getting agitated after so long didn't help but add more burden to the atmosphere.\nThe unconscious mana leak from the headmaster was making people breathless as they somehow held their ground and resisted the urge to vomit in the holy place.\n\"You! What do you want now!\"\nThe headmaster's voice was low, but it echoed in the hall profoundly enough to reach Austin as the latter mentioned gestured to close his ears in response to the loud noise.\n\"Take it, easy old man. Don't come to complain if suddenly your pharynx chokes just because of your exaggerated reaction.\"\nA few thick veins popped on the wrinkled head of the Academy's head Wizard as he heard the arrogant prick's disgraceful words.\nBut the headmaster's hair wasn't white for nothing. He knew Austin was trying to provoke him, but why? The Wizard was unaware of it, so he took the safe route and calmed himself down before asking.\n\"Tell me what you want, student.\"\nHe took a complete abort in his temperament as he asked Austin in a much calmer tone even though his aura was oozing with danger a couple of blinks ago.\nTruly terrifying.\nAustin raised his brows in fake astonishment before he coughed twice and stated the matter he was currently most amused upon.\n\"Since someone has dared to tarnish my reputation in the whole school, I want an apology if I came out innocent from the test you guys are putting me i-\"\nHis sentence didn't even conclude when one of the senior instructors turned herself toward Austin with wide eyes as she shouted at the top of her lungs.\n\"You want the daughter of Knight Commander to ask for forgiveness?!\"\nIt wasn't just a question but also a threat that Austin must take back what he said as what he asked was highly concerning and nerve-wracking.\nThe daughter of the Supreme Commander Charles was herself a very arrogant and prideful woman. If she was to ask to kneel in front of anyone other than her father, no one was sure whether the questioner would get out alive.\nAnd even if Venessa agrees to plea for forgiveness in front of Austin, the person whom she calls 'Papa' would not let this thing slide at all.\nEveryone knew what might the knight commander Charles carry and how terrifying he would become when it came to the reputation of his motherland or his family.\nEven the aloof Alex, standing in the shadows, became pale as a sheet as a memory of Charles flashed in his mind of the time when Alex joked about Venessa in the past.\nThe whole room was terrified to even think about such a thing as an angry Knight was a disaster himself, not to talk about the Knight Commander himself.\nEvery eye wasn't leaving the blond youth, who was calmly standing by the shocked eyes of the Prominent Priest.\n\"Kid, think before you speak, or you'll lose your head in no time.\"\nThe sweating Priest muttered under his breath, which only Austin could have heard, but the latter one ignored like a buzz of a bee.\n\"Yes, I want just what you said, professor. I want Venessa to come and kneel in front of me to ask forgiveness for the blame she delegated to me. If you can't fulfill this wish of mine, then forget to even touch a hair strand on me.\"\nThe agitation, the agony for the possible insight, the fear of something irreversible was weighing the whole atmosphere like how water damps cotton.\nThe people praying for Austin's innocence some minutes ago suddenly took a 180° as losing their jobs was better than losing their head from the blade of the mad Knight of Royal Order.\n\"Do you think we will let you go away even if your wish isn't fulfilled, you bastard?!\"\nOne of the instructors walked forward and launched chains of bind toward Austin with agitation and terror clouding his mind to think anything clearly.\nPurple chains of mana advanced toward Austin at a furious pace. The bind was powerful enough to restrain a [Unique Class] demon, but no one has ever thought such a powerful spell would be played like this...\n**FLICK**\nJust as the front chain was about to touch Austin, he brought his left hand forward at a speed that was untraceable by various in the room before he flicked in the open air with his tightly held index finger.\n**BANG**\nIn an instant, all the binding chains disintegrated into particles as the conjurer was thrown into the air with force applied in counter to his spell.\nThe instructor who attacked Austin crashed into the church's main entrance with a loud bang, followed by his pained groans.\nA considerable gasp resonated in the church as everyone witnessed the true strength of Austin for the first time. But no one was aware that Austin didn't even use even 5% of his actual worth.\nThe previously tensed Alex was now looking at the scene with amazement and amusement covering his demeanor.\nThe raw strength of Austin's mana was able to dispel the magic of such a level wasn't something anyone had anticipated, which naturally put everyone under a strong influence of danger from the arrogant youth.\nLooking at his front with cold eyes, Austin spoke in a voice that sent fear down the spine of every person who was previously looking at him with murderous intent.\n\"Any second misbehave, and I wouldn't ponder for even a blink before turning this place into a graveyard even I turn one of the dead souls in the process. So think before you act. \"\nHis voice neither carried haughtiness nor agitation. He was stating his point in the most emotionless tone one could mutter.\nIt was the first time when someone had come across such an Austin who, without moving, was able to send such dreadful shivers to the listeners.\nBut strangely, it wasn't the headmaster who spoke his decision but the voice which only the Headmaster had heard until now.\n\"Agreed.\"\nEvery pair of eyes fixed on Austin turned subconscious toward the person who strolled toward the headmaster before he stood facing Austin.\nHis face had a wide grin as he adjusted his single lensed frame before he again spoke without even minding the consent of the head of the school.\n\"I, Alex Nuèye, the sole head court magician of the Gram Empire, promise you that once you proved to be an innocent here, I will personally bring Student Venesaa to the church right away and let you have your compensation for the humiliation. Is that okay?\"\nIf Austin wasn't aware of Alex's presence or personality, then Austin might have been surprised by his sudden appearance and such a cooperative offer.\nBut there were some certain perks when someone already has lived the world once through drawings and text once before.\nWith a similar wide grin, Austin turned forward to the prominent priest, baffling the latter, before Austin spoke in a confident tone.\n\"Baptise me, old man. I can't wait for my juicy compensation~.\"\n_____________...______________\nA/N:- Drop a comment if you're liking the story so far~",

      "content": "[Luna's POV:]\n'Everything is going as I thought...'\nCurrently standing at a corner inside the school church, I gawked at the sight, which was so profoundly pleasant that I found myself falling into a stupor quite a few times.\nEven though I was meant to pay attention to the people engaged in the baptizing bullshit they would be performing on my Austin, I was getting distracted because of the unfair Austin.\nThe way he shut their mouth by warning them coldly, I found such spectacle nothing less than majestic and handsome.\nThe way he dispelled the spell and arrogantly intimated them nearly made me lose my mind and damp my nether region.\nHe was utterly domineering.\n'Am again getting carried away.'\nSlapping my cheeks, I again pulled my guard as the priest finally got done with his fifth baptist on Austin and the fifth time showed the same results as before.\n\"How can this be possible!\"\n\"You are saying that a Newbie class defeated a Terror Demon single-handedly...? Bullshit! I won't believe it even if I die\".\n\"But what we have choices? He easily disintegrated Professor Nil's binding chains like he extinguished a match with a quick blow.\"\n\"Nothing seems to be comprehensible today! \"\nThe murmurs were flaring about Austin just as I wished.\nIt was undoubtedly quite notable how Austin dispelled such a spell with a flick and defeated such a high-ranking demon all by himself, but it would be surprising for those who don't know him.\nWell, in Austin's case, there won't be anyone other than me who would know this side of his.\nThe fact that Austin's mana was so pure and overwhelming made things much more acceptable for me. Even though I was confident in my appraisal skill, the amount of mana Austin hid was way more than my expectancy.\nAnd not only that, the points or something he gets from the system along with artifacts was still unused, which naturally could have provided a heavy load of power-up.\nBut the pure Austin didn't use such rewards because he thought those things were earned by making someone cry or sad.\n'Oh, my innocent child...'\nI sighed with my head shaking left to right as I thought about what I had to correct in my precious Austin to make him an absolute villain.\nWell, what I wanted to turn him over wasn't a villain, but instead how a man should think and behave in this cruel selfish world.\nAustin named it Villain, and so did I.\n\"Now Court Magician Alex-san. As you promised upon your name, please bring me my honor.\"\nAustin commanded the court magician, who was grinning all the way until the baptizing didn't end.\nThe way he looked at my Austin was disgusting enough for me to let him get eaten by leeches as he saw his death with his own eyes.\nBut me, as well as Austin, was aware of how valuable that mage was for us. But that doesn't mean I would let him advance toward Austin more than necessary.\n**Click**\nThe magician, without saying a word, bowed and left the church silently.\nThe old man headmaster was dead silent since the time Alex promised to bring Venessa to the church and look after baptism; his current self of his seemed justifiable.\nIt was decided from the time I told my plan to Austin that sooner or later, he would have to face Venessa's muscle-headed father to gain Nation-level popularity.\nAt first, Austin was reluctant, but my cozy persuasion made him surrender.\nIt was still unclear to me how [Charm] didn't work on him, but when I asked with puppy eyes, he accepted my proposal readily.\n'Maybe it's because of his last life....no..'\nThe thought of Austin knowing my true powers felt unreal as even in the previous life, in the comic book he read about this world, there wasn't any mention of me using any other spell other than 'Holy Magic.'\nI didn't know whether the real me and the comic me were the same, but I have resolved myself never to get entrapped in such depth of eternal hell by falling for such a scumbag human named Kyouki.\n**Click**\nThe door soon swung apart as two people entered the church, followed by Alex.\nAs simpelton as ever, the hero of humanity couldn't just leave his harem member to go on such a challenging mission like just saying a simple 'Sorry,' alone, can he?\nSighing, I rested myself on the nearby wall before directing my gaze upon the scene.\n'Well, let's just enjoy the show for now.'\n____________.._______________\n[Austin's POV:]\n'Luna was right...'\nI nodded inwardly as I witnessed the things Luna told me would happen happening right in front of my eyes.\nAs she said, Hero Kyouki didn't let Venessa come alone. To be honest, I had a high doubt about whether anyone would accept my desire to bring Venessa here, taking his father's position into account.\nBut thanks to the brain-dead Alex that everything was happening better than my expectancy.\nWell, to be honest, I was a little scared...behaving like this and showcasing my power without restraints, but somehow it wasn't an unpleasant feeling.\nFirst time I wasn't getting thrown like trash or receiving curses without flaring back.\nEven though I behaved like a barking dog in the past, it doesn't mean I didn't have any self-respect. I just suppressed it for my villain's point.\nBut the Villain's Point receiving continuously on my tab made it clear that my approach was wrong. I could have preserved my dignity if I had thought of this method before.\nBut what happened was also good as if I behaved like I am right now, then I might not have drawn close to Luna as I have grown in this one week.\n'Urgh! I want to see her really bad...'\nFighting my urges, I came across the angry couple who had been glaring daggers from the time they entered.\nThe people in the surrounding mostly has covered their mouths as they saw Venessa walking toward the aisle where I was standing.\nWell, it has to be expected as the wild Venessa cooperating so sincerely was an unreal spectacle in itself.\n\"You...what trickery you used this time...?!!\nIt wasn't Veness who shouted instead, her savior.\nThe hero lunged forward and grabbed my collar quite harshly with his flame-filled eyes just inches apart.\nThe strength he was applying on my collar would have choked a Newbie ranked student until now, but unfortunately, I wasn't the person they had evaluated me until now.\nFrom the perspective of raw strength, Kyouki was undeniably superior to me by many of the folds, but when it comes to mana supplement, I was sure he didn't stand a chance with his current strength.\n'[Enhancement]'\nI surrounded my arms with a thick layer of mana which amplified my strength quite a lot to the point where I was confident of destroying a 5-meter pillar with one punch.\nBringing both my hands on top of the hero's, I pulled them slowly apart.\n'Hmm?!'\nEven with my mana enhancement, it was incredibly tough for me to get off his hold while keeping a straight face, but in the end, I succeeded.\nThe wide-eyed hero who failed to maintain his hold on me looked so shocked that it felt like he had just lost arm wrestling to a toddler.\n\"Keep your hands in control, hero, before you lose them.\"\nSaying so, I pushed Kyouki lightly by tapping on his chest. The shock of defeat didn't let him control his movement, and he ended up staggering by his own limbs and falling on his butt.\n\"Kyouki-kun!!\"\n\"Hero-sama!\"\nThe principal and beauty jumped to help Kyouki as the latter one finally got out of his stupor.\n\"You monster!\"\nVanessa growled at me as she supported her beloved with murderous intent clouding her eyes.\nBut I didn't intend to see their lovey-dovey at the moment, so I called for the Court Magician.\n\"Sir Alex, isn't it time for you to fulfill your promise? I don't have all day to waste here. Someone is waiting for me too, after all.\"\nThe last part came out in the spur, but the heavy mana leak from the hero and the boost in my Villain's point proved my slip of the tongue as a good omen?\n'Seriously, I feel like Ntr'ing the Hero.'\nShaking my head, I saw Alex walking forward with an amused look on his face just like I had before he whispered something in Venessa's ear.\nI couldn't hear the content, but looking at the bitter expression on her face, it seemed he must have used some chivalry principles or her father's name to corner her.\n\"You don't have to, Venessa ... It's okay for me to have the blame\".\nThe hero held the damsel in distress as she was about to walk forward.\n\"No, Kyouki-kun. I always thought that I was nothing but a burden on you and everyone else. So just this once, when I have the chance, please let me have it.\"\nThe pure and consensual act of sympathizing with each other while receiving tears and praise from surrounding felt...awkward to me.\nBut well, that's my opinion.\nFor what I was waiting for was finally happening as Venessa gave a last squeeze to Kyouki's hand before walking toward me with heavy steps.\nHer eyes were still rebellious, but I didn't have anything to do with it. I was doing all this for my own selfishness, just like in the past, but I only changed the course of my approach.\nFinally arriving some meters from me, Venessa lowered her head before inhaling deeply as some words flew along with her exhale.\n\"I...I am sorry.\"\n\"Eh? Did you say something? Sorry, the wind was heavy. Please repeat.\"\nWell, what I said was my honest thought, but it seemed to flare differently.\nVanessa looked at me in a way where if eyes could have killed, she would have burnt me thrice already. And not only her, but I also felt heavy mana from the bystanders.\n'Ah, it's getting tiring...'\nFinally, after some moments, it seemed Venessa let go of her pride, and with a deep bow, she finally uttered the words I had never thought of hearing in this life from her.\n\"For the blame I put upon you, I ask for your forgiveness.\"\nMy eyes went wide as her words traveled up to me.\nNo, it wasn't her apology that shocked me but rather the white and black screen, which I have grown accustomed to seeing but not something like this has ever happened before.\nMy mouth parted as I read the content, only to feel disbelief shrouding my consciousness.\n[Ding!]\n[You have changed the main plot by an extreme margin! Due to the host's action, the real-time situation has shifted to a different conclusion. ]\n[Congratulations, you have attained the completion of your second Quest]\n[Destiny Manipulator]\n[Reward:-\n1. 1000 Villain's Point\n2. Mystic grade Exterminist\n3. Hidden Skill (Locked) ]\n____________________...\nA/N:- The chapter was a little fast-paced as I didn't want to drag this scene for long. I was first planning to merge the previous chapter with this one, but it would have become hella long.\nAnyway, the arc of becoming overpowered and displaying the true might of a villain would be commencing, so look forward to it~",

      "content": "\"You did great.\"\nCurrently lying on my lap was my precious Austin, who, after handling the church matter, returned to me obediently.\nI didn't know that my obsession with Austin would enhance so much in so less time that not being able to touch him or talk to him would make me so much panicked.\nApart from my grandma, I never grew closer to anyone in my entire life.\nBut Austin was different, or to say if my grandma, along with the whole world, stands at one side and Austin on the other, I was sure which side I would lean on.\nI wasn't aware of what made me so addicted to him, but who cares?\nWhat I wanted was right in front of my eyes, enjoying my warmth and providing me with his presence. And that's all I could ask any more.\n\"It's all thanks to Luna that I was able to handle so many things with such ease. If you haven't trained me properly before, I doubted whether I would have withstood such amount of intent from my surrounding.\"\nMy love whispered some sweet words with his eyes closed as he enjoyed the caress I was providing him with my hand over his hair.\nHe likes it when I fawn over him.\nI was fortunate that Austin doesn't open his eyes whenever he makes such an adorable face, or I might scare him...\n\"I just gave you the framework. What you said and how you acted were all your hard work. So stay silent and let me pamper you.\"\nAustin sighed in defeat before turning his face toward my belly. The urge to rashly hug him until he doesn't go breathless and I end up accomplishing something irreversible rose inside me.\nBut thanks to the perseverance I have cultivated for so long, I was able to resist my devil and let the relationship nurture before I could partake my wild thoughts into reality.\nIt would happen; eventually, I just have first to build the road, so I don't push my Austin away.\n\"But Luna...was it okay to provoke Venessa like this? I mean, I did get a tremendous point gain, but what about the consequences? We both know that numerous professors would fill the capital with the news of the church, and in a day or two, the knight Commander would make his appearance.\"\nAustin's a little worried tone made me clear that he was aware of Commander Charles' 'Blade of Despair', but because he had kept hidden the fact about knowing this world, he couldn't confess Captain Charles' secret weapon to me.\nTo be honest, I wanted to tell him about the fact that I knew Austin's secret, but there was a side of mine that still wasn't prepared for it.\nMaybe I feared Austin's distrust toward me, or perhaps he might come to hate me...\n'No, it's fine how it is...'\nSubconsciously the hand on Austin's hair clenched as I thought of the possibility that I never would like to pursue.\n\"Luna, are you scared?\"\nOblivion about my actual thought, my caring Austin held my hand as he directed his gentle gaze toward me.\nI held his hand back with a clear smile returning to my face as what Austin has faced until now; stress would be the last thing I would like to delegate to him.\n\"No, I am not scared, my dear Austin. And you also don't have to worry about the Captain. Despite being so much famous for war God and whatsoever, there isn't a chance for him to come out victorious when I am standing right beside you. Remember, Austin, whatever happens, I will always be at your side, shielding you from any possible threat and pushing you always to move forward. So stop worrying and rely on me at times like these, okay?\"\nI gently brushed my thumb over his cheeks as I assured my beloved that in this world, even God wouldn't dare to touch him when I was by his side.\nAnd I wasn't promising him baselessly. I had the confidence and strength to keep my words, and after meeting my love, I found the goal I had always longed for.\nNow I had a reason for whom I could let go of my restraint and regret nothing in the process.\nNow I had someone whom I could call mine...\n\"You sure sounds manly sometimes, Luna.\"\nMy brows frowned as I heard my sweety talking, not something sweet, but the giggle he let out after his words had already worked as compensation.\n\"Do I look like a man to you, Austin?\"\nThe reason I complained despite not being angry or knowing full well what he meant was I hoped that he might compliment me...\n\"Who said? For me, no one could be more girly and feminine than you. Not to talk about the beauty you adorn which leaving any man, I doubt even any woman could behold. I meant it was the way you just committed things.\"\n...Yes, I love you too~ ♡♡.\nSadly I wasn't able to confess back my feelings as fluently as he did because I knew Austin really didn't love me that much to choose me over his blue marble chick.\nI want him to say, 'I love you the most, Luna. Please let me impregnate you' and I would go 'Khya! Please be gentle with me', types of scenario.\nBut he hasn't opened his heart to me until now, and I knew that would take time, so I was happy with my imagination alone.\n\"..What I really want to say was, you don't have to shoulder my responsibility. It's a truth that I am and will be relying on you, but that doesn't mean I would like to become a burden on you.\"\nI became speechless as his words reached me.\nThe first thing that came to my mind was...\nCan a person be this much, pure?\nI highly doubt whether a person who, despite facing so many difficulties and shitty people in each life, would be so much gentle and considerate toward others.\nIf I didn't have my [Mystic Eye], which I used on Austin at the start of our relationship, then I might have thought of him using flowery words and faking his behavior.\nBut now, I was ashamed of why I ever doubted my beloved's word and thought anything otherwise. He's a kind and lovely person through and through which this world wasn't worthy of.\nThat's why I was hogging him all for myself...\n\"Don't worry, Austin. You won't become a burden on me, not today, not tomorrow, not ever. We will support each other while sharing our grief and enjoying our happiness together. So, please be with me until the end, okay~.\"\n_______\nOn the same night, when the two love birds were conveying their feeling through words and enjoying each other warmth, a very chilly atmosphere surrounded the place miles away from the academy.\nIn the continent's center where the significant officials and most trade centers were based, along with the residences of some selected high nobles, the Kingdom of Gram.\nThe palace of the emperor was the only place in the world that was wholly made of Gold and rubies.\nThe main palace showed how resourceful and prosperous the nation of Gram is.\nAnd there was a reason for such prosperity in the kingdom, as compared to other continents where losses have never left their sides; for the Gram kingdom, those losses have been minimized due to the presence of excellent troops the Kingdom nurtured.\nIn the Gold Palace, a person wearing a black uniform with his whole body covered and only some portion of his upper face up to his eyes visible sat in an extravagant reception.\nThe person was so hidden from the outside world that if not heard his voice, people might misunderstand him for a woman.\nThe reason for his thin limbs and soundless movements was due to the job he performs in his everyday life.\nThe person soon got up from the comfortable couch as he heard the guard on the door announcing the arrival of the person whom the shrouded man came to meet.\nUpon sensing the incoming presence, the shrouded man turned on his heel before he landed his left knee on the ground with his right hand over his chest as he bowed respectfully.\n\"This lowly one greets the emperor.\"\nThe person whom he regarded as 'Emperor' passed by the kneeling man without batting an eye to the gesture before he plopped down on a big sofa that was kept aside from the normal couches.\n\"You may stand now.\"\nUpon hearing the command, the shrouded man got up and faced his majesty with his head still little bowed.\n\"Rito...you know what's the time, right? Do you want me to get divorced or something?\"\n\"I humbly ask for forgiveness for the intrusion, my lord, but this matter needs\nurgent attention of yours.\"\nWhile saying, the shrouded man Rito took out a piece of paper from under his black waist before forwarding it to the man with his brows up in surprise.\nThe emperor was well aware that his trusted spy would never disturb him if not for an urgent matter, but the problem was that the letter he took had a seal of the Eden Academy. The place which the emperor also never takes causally.\nFrowning his brows, the middle-aged man tore the envelope before he started to read the content written on it, only to get his eyes stretched out in the process.\n\"Rito....this...?\"\nWith disbelief clouding his mind, the emperor of the Gram Kingdom asked his trusted employee about the thing he found utterly absurd.\n\"I snatched it from the messenger in charge of reporting everything related to young lady Venessa to the Knight Commander Sir Charles.\"\nThe emperor's forehead was soon covered with bids of sweat as he thought of the possibility of what would have happened if Rito hadn't brought this letter away, and Charles would have learned that his princess was humiliated like this.\nIt goes without saying what the muscle head would do if he came to know such a thing happened in the knowledge of every instructor and the headmaster himself.\n'That fucking Brat!!'\nCursing under his breath, the emperor retracted his gaze back to Rito before he began to command something which needed immediate effect.\n\"Arrange a letter to the 21st Battalion which Sir Charles is leading and hand them the remaining lairs of the northern Jungle. Whatever you write in that letter, make sure not to let him return before at least ten days.\"\nRito just nodded firmly as he waited for the following command.\n\"Ask that bastard Alex to return by tomorrow, or I will burn his office.\"\nA none visible grin formed on the spy's lips as the thought of seeing the menace Alex running around to save his theories made Rito tempted, but he didn't dare to say such thoughts.\n\"And lastly, inform the school to make proper arrangements for the hero, so he doesn't get involved in all this. I will send troops for the fort defense.\"\nThe emperor, after saying such in an anxious manner, fell silent with his eyes fixed constantly on the spot, thinking of the possible preparation he could arrange so he could minimize damage.\nStopping Charles from visiting Eden academy was close to impossible that's why he wasn't thinking of such a route entirely and was focusing on the precautions.\nSuddenly his train of thought came to a halt as he heard the low voice of his loyal spy.\n\"My lord...what about Sir Vincent's son?\"\nUpon hearing the query, the emperor sneered without blinking twice as he shrieked on his shoulder in hopelessness.\n\"That brat has brought death upon himself. And now, when Count Vincent has also abandoned him, I fear he won't be able to even have a proper funeral. Forget about him; just make sure you keep the hero safe and away from the scene. What will happen to that bastard prick won't be any of my concern.\"\n________\nA/N:- Ah, this sweet and bitter chapter.\nAnyway, drop a comment if you are hyped for the couple's date ;)",

      "content": "Monster Lairs.\nThe place where inhumane reside and also the place where I would be training my skills for the upcoming battle with the Knight Commander.\nLairs, as the name sounds, were the inhabitance of monsters where they hid their treasure and mana stone.\nI had gone to small Lairs before until I didn't get my Villain's System.\nMy first experience was not as scary as I thought since the rank I picked for my first lair was the third rank of [Rare Class].\nSince I easily defeated the lair floors and also the boss monster, I pushed myself for more and increased the level.\nBut nothing, I repeat, nothing was even comparable to the lair I was standing right in front of.\n\"Luna...what...is this....\"\nSince monsters couldn't surpass the threshold of [Unique Rank] until they don't accept curse energy, monsters and lairs where they reside were limited only to the Unique level.\nSince Cursed Demons don't get restrained by any kind of bind or get clouded with the greed of mana stones, Demons often wander aimlessly in the outside world.\nThen those who were left were Rare and Unique Class which comprises certain kinds of lairs, primarily placed in Jungles which the adventurers challenge to gain mana stones and treasures.\nEden Academy also books small to small-medium size lairs to let the students know the fear of actual terror in this world.\nBut the lair which I was sensing and seeing with my own eyes was far from the caves that a school would ever leave their students to explore.\nHeck, even adventurers wouldn't dare to challenge this lair, due to the ominous and life-threatening vibe it was oozing with.\n\"This lair is something you could say I created ...um, more like I enhanced it.\"\nStanding beside me was the grinning Luna, who brought me to the South-Eastern Jungle in the name of my training after school.\nFirst, I thought it was a kind of date, as this jungle wasn't explicitly known for lairs, but when she told me about her true intentions, I was embarrassed to the core.\n'It's good that I didn't change my clothes. '\nAshamed of my shameless mind, I looked toward the dark cave, which was filled with mana and was far above from the Unique class and was to the point where the Terror class could be threatened.\n\"You enhanced it?\"\nI pretended to be oblivious, but I knew what she was saying.\nIn the manga I read, there was a time when the hero became so powerful that normal Lairs didn't prove to be worthy of him.\nIn that scenario, the Court Magician Alex, along with some high-rank mages, came forward to enhance the lairs to provide their hero-sama with an endless training ground.\nBut the problem was that Lair enhancement takes a hell amount of mana which was close to impossible for even a group of men to achieve in one day, taking Saint Class Magicians into account.\nAnd here, a single entity enhanced a lair all by herself?\nIt would be a lie to say I completely trusted Luna's word at this moment because I know very well how absurd it was to enhance a single lair regardless of the level. And the mana flow I was sensing from the cave in front was not something I could ever expect for even [Saint Class ] high ranking mage to achieve even with proper support.\n\"I will tell you one day how I do it. But for now, let's prepare.\"\nStiffly I nodded still with my eyes continuously fixated upon the cave we would be entering after some moments.\nWell, to say I wasn't scared would be a partial lie, but after facing the Terror Ranked Golem, I somehow had a confidence boost that helped me maintain my calm and not show my weak side to Luna.\n'Well, she already has seen me in my most miserable state.'\nA dry chuckle left my lips when Luna continued with her previous words.\n\"Okay, Austin, first tell me how many points you have accumulated until now?\"\n\"Umm....let me check.\"\n'Stats'\n[Name:-      Austin\nAge:-           15\nRace:-          Human\nHP :-            1200-> 300 (Limiter)\nMP:-            3600-> 500 (Limiter)\nStr:-             480-> 120     (Limiter)\nSpd:-           500-> 250    (Limiter)\nStm:-           375\nAttributes:- Flames(86)\nWind (74)\nAqua (32)\nEarth (41)\nXXXX  (0)\nSkills:-        Infernous Conjuror (A)\nGravity Manipulation (A)\nSilent Steps (B)\nSprint (A)\nPain Infliction (S)\nTongue of Spirit(SS)\nDark Escape (B)\nStats Points:- 15000\nWeekly Villain's Point:- 1200/ 2000]\n(A/N:- A Saint rank mage has around 1500 MP, and a hero has about 900. The strength that the current Kyouki carries is above 1100. And also, I might alter the stats, so check it when I notify you)\nLooking at the attribute points I have accumulated in these 18 months, a strong gulp passed my throat as the possibility of accepting all those points was so lethal that I never even thought about it.\nWell, the source from which I earned those points was so hideous that the thought of utilizing those points made me disgusted.\nBut now, I didn't have any option. I could only feel disgusted if I had my breathe regulating. If I don't use those points, then there would be no chance of me surviving the incoming catastrophe.\n\"It's enough to push all my stats to the next level. But Luna, there's a limit to how much I can add stats points in one day. If my body doesn't get accustomed to my newly added power, I might crumble into a vegetative state.\"\nUpon hearing me, Luna's face went pale like a sheet as she held my hand subconsciously.\nWell, it was given that she would be startled to hear such a possibility, but I was a little happy to know that she cares about my well-being.\nLuna became silent for some seconds, which gave me a bad feeling, and her following words made my doubt clear.\n\"Hey Austin...won't it be fine if I deal with all this Knight Commander thing, and you rest in your room? We can gradually train together in the future, too, right?\"\nLuna turned her puppy eyes toward me while pleading for something that I might not be able to accept, even if I would be pushed to the edge of my death bed.\n\"We are going inside, Luna. Stop thinking useless stuff, and follow me if you don't want to be left behind.\"\nI started walking in the ominous direction hurriedly.\nThe reason I snatched myself away in such a rush was because of those freakin eyes, which were so dangerous for me that I felt my heart often leaping and skipping under that gaze.\nIt's too tough to resist such persuasion when the pleader was so adorable.\nShaking my head, I tried to let go of my wavering thoughts when suddenly my hand was grabbed by a warmth before I turned toward it, only to find a worried Luna standing there.\n\"Austin, please promise me that you won't push yourself more than necessary and if ever inside the lair you find yourself struggling, you will call out for me. Please listen to me on this one .\"\nHer charming face, which never missed to make me admire as well as tempted to fawn over her, was inches apart from me.\nHer hot breaths were hitting my face at unsteady intervals signifying how genuinely she was worried for me.\nTo be honest, I feel like I don't really deserve her attention and this much care, but there was no way I could ever reject her when she was so honest in this relationship.\nHolding her hand back, I reassured her with my brightest smile.\n\"Don't worry, as I said; we will support each other without holding back. So if something really does happen, I will not hesitate to rely on you.\"\n______________\n[Luna's POV]\n'He's too overprotective of me. '\nI sighed in awe as I saw my beloved walking cautiously inside the dark lair with his movement mainly positioned in shielding me.\nEven though I told him that there was no point defending me when I had erased my presence, he just couldn't settle his worries.\nWell, to say I was frustrated about it would be a plain white lie.\nI was utterly delighted to think that Austin thought so highly of me that he was protecting me in a place where he might have difficulties surviving.\nHis broad and reliable back, his strong hands, which he was using to hold daggers, and his fierce eyes, which he was applying to keep an eye on the surrounding, were so enthralling that I thought how I had missed such fine art until now.\nTo be honest, after hearing Austin's words related to the consequences of his system points, I wondered whether letting him pursue this route was a good idea.\nBut in the end, I couldn't ask Austin to become mine and let everything be done in a blink. I knew his pride as a man would never allow him such, and I genuinely admired this side of his.\nBut the possibility of letting Austin get into a state where I couldn't pull him back scared me.\nI had my various spells of healing, but who knows what actually might happen to Austin if he was to use his points hurriedly.\nI didn't want to think about it, nor would I let it happen.\nClenching my fist in determination, I strengthened my resolve before I fixed my gaze upon Austin.\nWe walked in silence for some meters inside the dark cave with a fireball which Austin chanted, as the only illumination source.\n'Hmm...?'\nSuddenly mine and his steps came to a halt as he whispered something silently.\n\"..here it comes.\"\nAs he said, a monster on the rank of Threshold of Unique class plunged forward at a pace that far surpasses any monster could ever muster.\nThe monster which charged at Austin was a Hobgoblin of 1 meter in height and claws probably more than 15cm in length. The disgusting monster had its eyes dyed red due to the overflow of mana it had tasted, and along with its enhanced stats, it became a terrifying being that could run havoc in a small town all by itself.\nAustin instantly blocked his face, with his arms crossed in front and daggers tip pointed toward the incoming goblin.\n**BANG**\n\"Huh?\"\nI intentionally let out a sound as I saw the result of the collision of Austin and the monster. Even though the beast was strong, I was sure with Austin's strength that, he would not have much difficulty dealing with it.\nBut just upon the first physical interaction of the two, Austin was sent flying backward before colliding with the cave wall.\nMy eyes went wide as Austin's figure started to disappear because of the broken rocks and the dust which erupted because of his crash.\n\"AUSTIN!!!\"\nShouting at the top of my lungs, I felt my world destroying right before my eyes as the thought of life without Austin immediately took over my consciousness.\nBut before I could even move a single muscle out of my instincts, Austin's face suddenly emerged out of the dust as he called out for me.\n\"I am okay, Luna. It's just I forgot to remove my limit....\"\nHis voice broke in the middle as his eyes became round as he stared in the direction where the hobgoblin was.\nLooking at his sullen expression, I also turned my head in the direction, only to get startled.\nThe Hobgoblin, which just was about to launch another attack on Austin, wasn't there anymore. Its body parts were burst into pieces with its blood splattered in all directions.\nWhen I realized the reason for such a situation, an embarrassed smile formed on my lips as I looked at Austin apologetically.\nWorth a sigh, Austin raised his hand before he walked toward me with a defeated expression.\n\"I better not quarrel with you in the future, or you might blast me away without even realizing .\"\n______________________\nAfter school, at the same time, when Austin and Luna went to explore their modified dungeon, a particular group of four people gathered in a room.\nThese four were the members of the  Hero's party who, along with the hero himself, gathered in their meeting room as per their leader's call.\nDue to the recent incident, the atmosphere around the school has become heavier to the point where students have been leaving the school for their safety, and even teachers were retiring all of a sudden.\nIt goes without saying, what was the reason why such things were happening in the school as no one in the entire continent was not aware of the might which the Knight Commander Charles carries.\n\"Troops from the capital have arrived. My father is also asking me to return back. The situation has gone out of hand more than we expected.\"\nThe one who said those words with utter seriousness was Sicily Seymour, daughter of Duke Reynold Seymour.\nThe all-time cheery Sicily was this much contemplating and pondering over the situation because of the person involved in this.\nAnd not only her but others in the room also had the same kind of expression on their face, specially Venessa.\n\"It's all my fault. Why did I ever blame Austin when I wasn't aware of what level of trickery he had? To be honest, him dying from the hands of my papa doesn't seem too bad.\"\nHer thoughts were something that Sicily mutually also agreed with, but unlike Venessa, she held it in and waited for Kyouki's judgment on the matter.\nLilia was just sitting expressionlessly, not ready to accept what happened in the church at all.\nAmong the other three, Lilia's thoughts were the most complicated and twisted regarding Austin at the moment. But she knew bringing them out would make nothing but Kyouki more troubled.\nThe person in the head position of the team and the person who was always looked upon by countless was now sitting with his fingers intervened in front of his mouth and eyes frowned at nothing constant.\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, Kyouki finally got up from his seat, attracting every gaze upon himself as he made his judgment.\n\"The matter related to Austin can be handled afterward, first; we have to do something about incoming danger. Please don't take it rudely, Venessa.\"\nVanessa smiled with a shake of her head, signifying she didn't mind her papa being called a threat.\nWalking toward the center, he spoke with confidence bursting with his every syllable and determination clouding his eyes.\n\"Since Luna would eventually get involved in this matter, I, as his friend, have to step up and stop Sir Charles. Please forgive me, Venessa, when I say it, but I will fight your father with everything I have.\"\nLilia immediately got out of her stupor as she heard the unexpected announcement of her beloved before her eyes went wide in shock.\nSicily kept her gaze low as she somehow knew this would happen, so Kyouki's commitment didn't bother her much.\nVanessa was the only one who got up from her swat with a defeated smile on her charming face as she faced the man she had decided to give her all in this life.\n\"I knew this would happen, Kyouki-san. Your love for Luna is something I could never level up to, but the only thing I can do is to support you with all my might until the end. So please count me in too.\"\nUpon hearing the prideful daughter of the knight commander betraying her father and going against him, made Kyouki was incredibly moved.\n\"Vanessa....\"\n\"Count me in too, Kyou-kun. I have been thinking of using my new attack strategies on a strong opponent for so long.\"\nSicily also got up with a smile as she joined the fray, making Kyouki almost teared up with the support his friends were providing him, even though this fight wasn't for humanity but for Kyouki's own selfishness.\n\"I will also help. Even though I am not strong as you guys, I will do my best to stop Sir Charles from harming anyone on this school ground. So count me in too.\"\nLilia also got up from her seat before she moved toward the group while muttering her unclear resolve.\nBut since everyone was so much clouded by the matter at hand, no one paid much attention to Lilia's actual statement hidden behind her words.\nLooking at everyone, Kyouki sighed in relief and slight elation as his heavy heart finally got some piece of calmness.\n\"Everyone...I promise that whatever happens from now on, I will take full responsibility to keep you guys safe and also bring our Luna back to us.\"\n_______________________\nA/N:- There will be a harsh confrontation between Luna and Kyouki in the future which would be hella satisfying.\nDrop a comment if you are hyped~",

      "content": "Walking in a straight path, a young man in his mid-teens cautiously sensed his surrounding as his feet made nonexistent noise even upon landing on twigs and leaves in the process.\nThe way Austin cleared the first four floors was nothing but astonishing for Luna as what measures she set for the initial stages was nothing but impossible for even Hero's party to clear even though they would have been supported by the court magician along with the Royal Order.\nOn the second floor, the density of monsters increased with the level of them slowly turning folds and rapidly inflicting more and more lethal blows.\nLuna has lost count of how many times she almost threw her concealment and was about to jump on the battlefield only to get surprised by Austin's next attack, which left her speechless every time.\nAustin's spells weren't otherworldly, but the way he uses them and how he utilizes his surroundings according to his convenience was frightening to the point where Luna checked her memory, whether she left any part of Austin's past where he was trained like this professionally.\nEven though it took him almost two days, he successfully cleared the first four floors without receiving any fatal wounds which needed Luna's assistance.\nSince he did have a hell amount of healing potion, he decided to rely on himself until he didn't become entirely helpless.\nLuna also followed her beloved's wish and didn't interfere at all other than whispering something lovingly in between the floors and whenever Austin halted for a break.\nHe was continuously adding the stats point along the journey as he got used to his new enhanced powers thanks to the many enemies he was gifted with.\nIt seemed Luna didn't only enhance the lair but also used her Space and Time Magic to populate the shelter by many folds; as Austin sensed when he compared this amount to the other caves he went or heard, this lair was oddly dense.\nBut he wasn't complaining, more like he was enjoying this trip because it was the first time he could let go of his restraint and fight like he always wanted to.\nFor the first time, he wasn't holding his strength, nor was he stressed about the Villain's point at all.\nHe was being himself.\nAnd he loved this side of his.\n**BANG**\nCrushing the head of a minotaur like a watermelon, Austin landed on the ground with his body covered with green-colored fluid which came from the popped veins of the monster.\n\"Guess I should have packed extra clothing.\"\nWiping his face and some portion of his abdomen, which was barely exposed by now, he muttered under his breath. Besides his pants, everything from his upper body has been removed by him or scratched by monsters.\nSince he never planned to stay days inside the lair, nor did he have a habit of packing such necessities other than meat jerks inside his inventory, he never had an option to wear something different than he already was.\n\"Sorry, Austin, but I also didn't bring anything with me.\"\nLied plainly was the beautiful silver-haired bishoujo behind Austin who, despite having tons of clothing in her spatial storage, said such lies not once but twice now.\nThe reason why Luna lied despite having enough long shawls and shrouders for Austin to wear was that she loved what she saw.\nLooking at Austin's bare body, she had lost count of how many times she used tissue paper to wipe her nose. She was ashamed of herself but not enough to let the treat of her eyes get stolen away by a damn piece of clothing.\n\"It's okay, Luna. I should have prepared myself more.\"\nScratching the back of his head with a dry smile, Austin assured Luna, only to make later one bring out more of her tissues just because of the casual gesture he displayed.\nSuddenly the moving hand of, Luna, as well as the smile of Austin, broke into constant as they sensed a massive presence approaching.\n\"Hide somewhere, Luna. This time it might go wild.\"\nWithout a word, Luna nodded before she concealed herself completely and backed away. Levitating freely in the air, she kept her distance from Austin only to the point where all her senses could keep the focus on him.\nSensing the disappearance of mana from his back, Austin prepared himself.\nStretching his body a little, he took the stance and enhanced his senses to the fullest, to his front from where the heaviest amount of mana was enraging.\nIt didn't take long before the figure of a heavy monster of more than 2.5 meters in size appeared. The body of the incoming monster was severe enough that it's every tap on the ground sent tremors to the surrounding.\nUpon seeing the steady human in front, the monster, which had enough brain to ponder what might be dangerous for its life, halted in its rush as its body finally came out of the shadows.\n**HUUUFFFF**\n(A/N:- I will regard the minotaur as 'it,' so don't get confused)\nDark brown thick skin covered with countless scars and heavy marks spread over the body along with bushy body hair on its tree branch-like arms and around its crater plate chest. The hulking bull face was exhaling heavy gusts of wind, blowing the leaves of trees nearby. Apart from the ring stuck around its prominent nose, the monster had no metal as a weapon with it.\nThe minotaur boss affirmed the mana presence from Austin, but since the monster was aware of what the single human had done back in the forest, it didn't rush to attack front on, instead, it decided first to analyze its opponent's might.\n**CREAKKK**\nThe giant being landed its humongous palm on the trunk of a nearby tree before tearing it apart from the soil in one pull.\nThe tree was gushed out of the ground like it was made up of foam, before the minotaur, without aiming correctly, threw the whole thing toward Austin without waiting for even an instance.\nAustin was well aware of what was happening and what presence of mind his opponent had, so with a smirk, he made his footing more rigid at his place before he activated one of his prominent spells.\n'[Silent Steps]'\nAs the name implies, the skill suggests Austin walks on a path that remains in the blind spot of his opponent. This technique was related to his mind as no physical route was displayed; instead, only a quick map draws inside his mind upon how he could approach his enemy.\nThe only drawback of this technique was the high number of opponents, the more incredible difficulty it would be for him to pursue.\nBut when his opponent was a single inhumane, he didn't have to think twice before using the skill as he disappeared from his place instantly.\nThe minotaur became anxious as it saw the tree passing from the spot where it caught the human standing a second before. Since the speed with which the tree was thrown was nothing to scoff about, the spectacle became even more impossible to believe.\nSuddenly the minotaur felt something ominous, but before it could even have moved a single inch, a slight burning sensation spread around the back of its head when it realized that the human had got on its back without even leaving a trail behind.\nAustin became breathless when he felt the boss's skin's thickness when he tried to stab his dagger around the medulla (the weak point of Minotaur). He didn't think that a simple stab would kill the monster but still not being able even to inflict decent damage was quite unsettling for Austin.\n'Am dead.'\nIn less than a blink, two sturdy hands tightly wrapped around Austin's torso before he was pulled from the back of the Minotaur to the ground in an instant, along with severe pain in the back of his head.\n**UOOOOOOHHHH**\nThe bull roared angrily as it finally got its prey in its unbreakable clutch as it stared at Austin, who was lying on the ground, still captive between the palms of the monster.\n\"Well, screw it!\"\nBefore the monster could have halted its siren of victory, Austin activated his spell without waiting for another second as he knew that any more than this, a certain someone would jump on the scene.\n'Breathe of Flame.'\nA ring of fire erupted from inside Austin's mouth as he directed a heavy pool of flames toward the Minotaur's face.\n**UOOGHHH**\nThe monster instantly got up from its leaning position, naturally letting go of its grip on Austin, which the latter didn't miss to attain.\nExtinguishing the flames with its hand, the minitour controlled its body before it started looking for its enemy with rage clouding its consciousness, triggering its primal instincts.\nSuddenly the creature felt its hind limbs restrained by the movement of the land underneath. In fret of anger, the minotaur, instead of running, started stomping on the ground in counter to the bounds which were clinging up to the thick legs of the monster.\nClouds of dust started emerging from the place where the mad monster was stomping on nothing but the ground.\nAustin waited for such a moment as his communication with the spirits finally stabilized.\n'XXXX-XXX-XXXXX'\nHe commanded the wind spirit to act immediately before the minotaur stops. The lazy souls nodded and went to work as per their contractor's request.\nSuddenly the dust clouds around the monster disappeared at an instance as a heavy amount of wind penetrated the surrounding, erasing all the trees and greenery from the specific spot around the minotaur.\nThe gust was so heavy that the monster, despite being over 1200lbs, couldn't move from its place at all. And since the wind was practically equal from each cardinal direction, the movement of the inhumane was entirely restrained.\n**GUUUUOOOOOOHHHHHH**\nIts roar never halted as it felt its body become prohibited from even inching from its position, but the thing was, nothing of its roar came out of the invisible cage that the wind spirit had created around the monster.\nAnd the primary factor was that the cage was solely made of a single gas...\nOxygen.\nCracking his finger, Austin looked at the scene from above as he called out for an item from his inventory for the first time after he started to get the artifacts.\n\"Let's see what this can do.\"\nA black lantern of much less than half a meter emerged from nothingness as Austin held it in front of his eyes to evaluate it.\nThe lantern was ignited and burning lazily in the center of the container without any sign of being a weapon.\n\"I guess it won't burn me.\"\nTaking his index finger inside, Austin felt his finger getting a little hot but not to the point where it could burn his skin.\nAustin took out his finger not so long after, only to get amazed.\nA slight burning flame was wrapped on his finger without moving a bit. Even though the wind was harsher this high up, the flame was keeping its texture completely unbothered by its surrounding.\nKeeping the lantern back into the inventory, Austin stared at the flame for a second before he directed his eyes toward the still roaring and struggling minotaur.\n'Now, let's see what these artifacts are capable of.'\nPointing his finger toward the ground with the thought of letting go of the tiny flame, Austin found the little amber dancing in the air and dropping at a serene pace toward the ground.\nOnly after 10 seconds did the little amber enter the cage that the air spirits had created before the surrounding seemed to went dead silent.\n...\n**BOOOMMMMMMMMM**\nA heavy blast that neither Austin nor Luna ever even imagined seeing erupted from the place where the amber landed and created a meteor-sized explosion.\nLuna instantly teleported beside Austin before shielding both of themselves with her highest ranking Spell in a blink.\nBoth humans were covered with a light blue ball of invisible mana as the scene beneath the ball changed drastically for more than a minute.\nAustin, along with Luna, saw the scene with their eyes wide in shock as the scenery converted from green covering into nothingness.\nAt a distance of more than 5 kilometers, the whole forest was blasted away instantly, with the woods outside of the proximity still covered in flames.\nThe whole thing only happened in mere 3 minutes, but still, the damage inflicted on the entire vicinity was far superior to any of Austin's spells.\nHowever, Austin forgot about one thing...\nLooking at the flaming scene and feeling the chills on his back, Austin was able to muster only a single word...\n\"Uh-oh...\"\n____________________\nA/N:- I thought of adding another POV of the outside world, but NVM. The next some chapters will be focused on the fights and the consequences, so look forward to it.",

      "content": "[2 Days ago]\nJust the day after, when the spy Rito brought the information regarding the matter of church to the emperor of Gram, a particular meeting was called in the golden palace.\nIn the place where the extravagant decoration with heavy chandeliers and expensive furniture was arranged could be seen figures of two men, varying in age.\nOne was bespectacled with a ring-sized frame around his left eye. His overall stature wasn't much to mention about; however, what might his spells carried was something that no one could ignore.\nThe other person sitting on the giant chair behind the table was a man in his mid-thirties. His platinum blonde hair with pair of blue eyes was proof of the royal bloodline to which the person belongs.\n\"I sent you to the academy to resolve the situation, not to flame it even more. The matter which could have been handled with the small rejection of that brat's wish for an apology has now escalated because of your unstable reasoning. Do you have anything to say in your defense?\"\nThe Emperor of Gram, William der Gramduör, the 15th emperor of the lands of prosperity and where the goddess of light has bestowed her blessings and protection, said in an irritated tone.\n\"My lord, what I did was all to save the reputation of our hero.\"\nThe one who answered with a sigh was the court magician Alex who, after being summoned by his majesty, returned to the capital using the Teleportation portal. Since the matter held great urgency that the royal messenger came to fetch Alex, teleportation, even being expensive, was the only option left.\nUpon hearing Alex's confident remark, William's brows frowned visibly as he leaned back on his chair. Without pondering on the matter by himself, the emperor delegated the job to the mage in front.\n\"Elaborate.\"\nCommanding in an authoritative tone, the king saw the court magician nodding before he started stating the reason why Alex made Venessa ask for forgiveness.\n\"I take the liberty to say that your Majesty, is aware of the expedition on which the Eden Academy releases their students and what rules those expedition carries, right?\"\nWithout thinking much, the emperor nodded as that academy was where he spent his boring three years before graduating without any fun events.\nDespite not being interested in the academy, the emperor was well aware of the expedition and the rules applied to ensure that no students dies in the name of the test.\n\"Using any spell on fellow student above the Unique Rank spell is prohibited, as may your majesty knows. But despite knowing the fact, Hero Kyouki-kun used his Legend Rank [Christine of Light] on Austin without having a single proof of him being a demon cult follower. Do you think if I hadn't brought Venessa to the church, Austin wouldn't have confessed about Hero's rash actions?\"\nThe emperor became pale throughout the explanation, which Alex confessed right at that moment. Knowing that Alex had no benefit from lying when he had sworn his loyalty to the Kingdom, the words seemed nothing less than a nightmare.\nMany things were incomprehensible from whichever perspective the emperor looked.\nFirst, why does the Hero even use such high-ranking magic on a person who hasn't even broken through Newbie Class?\nSecond, how the person who, even after getting attacked by a spell that could deal with Terror Class being if provided with buff, could survive the period and still could fight with the Terror demon single-handedly. If the baptism stated the natural conclusion, then Austin's origin contains the most concern at the moment.\nAnd last, knowing the actual personality of the ex-Nobel named Austin, the emperor was troubled about why  didn't Austin say anything about it in the church. Well, Austin did receive the apology, but those who knows his personality could expect him to spout every unfair action he was treated with?\nYet, Austin stayed silent.\nThe emperor was now far from mere concerned. He was terrified to think what could happen if the might which people are expecting to see from the hero gets proven to be less than a mere ex-Nobel.\nNo, he couldn't let that happen. He couldn't let the hero get distracted and act like a stupid brat!\n\"You know the reason why the hero acted such unreasonably?\"\nWith a dark expression, the emperor asked his trusted employee and wisest adviser about the best way to deal with the situation before it got out of hand.\nAlex took the bait, and while adjusting his frame, he threw his conclusion regarding the whole scenario that he had observed in a mere single day.\n\"It seems Kyouki-kun's personal feeling for Saintess Luna has been hindering his judgment. He thinks that Luna-sama has gone to Austin's side because of curse magic, but I have verified it's a baseless thought of Kyouki-kun to keep pushing to a greater extent so one day he can snatch Luna-sama back. \"\nAfter a pause, Alex continued without caring for the white-and-blue expression his majesty was showcasing.\n\"Other than the rule Kyouki-kun broke in the forest, this time, he would be pushing his luck to an impossible level.\"\nHearing such a suggestive remark, the eyes of the emperor went wide in shock as he hurriedly asked in disbelief.\n\"You mean ...Captain Charles...!!?\"\nWordlessly Alex nodded before the blonde man slammed his palm on the big table in a fret of frustration.\n\"This hero!!\"\nWilliam gritted his teeth to the point where his jaws started aching, but the emperor was in no mind to think about it at all.\nThe thought of Kyouki facing Charles was undeniably gave an ominous feeling, as neither Charles would listen to the emperor's command nor the blind hero would back away from the confrontation when his love was involved in this.\n'I can't let Charles and Kyouki clash, whatever happens.'\nAlex stood there silently without a single word as the emperor contemplated on the matter for more than half an hour before it seemed that something finally clicked in William's mind.\nHe instantly directed his gaze upon Alex as he stated his command, which required immediate implication.\n\"Alex, write a letter to the Northern Emperor Norsvolk that if he doesn't bring his daughter back to his country in three days, then the relationship between the nations will be severed entirely without any further ado. Use teleportation to go there by today evening and bring me good news by night. Understood, now move!\"\n_______________________\n[Present Timeline]\nIt was the third day since Luna and Austin entered the enhanced Lair, which Luna specifically prepared for Austin.\nThe lair was only cleared up to the sixth floor since Austin started to have problems keeping up with his physical boost and reached the extreme where he could push his body for now.\nLuna instantly teleported them to the entrance when she felt Austin at his worst and, along the way, healed him from head to toe.\n\"It sure was freezing out there. I will challenge this place with more clothes next time.\"\n\"Well, I offered a comfortable body warmer, but you missed your chance, sir Austin~.\"\nThe couple was enjoying each other's company while they flirted along the way.\nNot so long after, the natural sunlight of the outside world shone over the couple as they finally got out of the cave after almost half a week.\nBut just after exiting the darkness, instead of Luna's face brightening up, a cloud of frown took over her expression.\nAustin also felt the change in Luna's temperament before he followed her line of sight and found the reason for such change.\nA man in his late twenties was standing solemnly without any particular expression on his face, at some distance from the cave entrance.\nHis hair was ashy silver, with lean arms and tall stature defining his physique. The thick furry coat over the upper half of his body signified that the person didn't belong to this continent, where winters never went this harsh that a person could wear such insulating clothes.\nLuna was very well aware of the person she saw, and by no means was she elated to see such a person at this place unexpectedly.\n\"Austin, can I...?\"\nLike an obedient wife, Luna asked for permission, to which Austin subconsciously nodded before Luna left his side and walked toward the strange man.\nAustin hightened his senses, but since he was unaware of the language they were using in the tongue of their motherland, he soon lost hope of understanding the situation.\nThe man from the homeland of Luna took out a letter inside his coat before forwarding it.\nLuna froze in her place for quite some time before she finally steeled her resolve and scratched the top of the envelope, and started reading the content.\nAustin saw the scene with a slight disturbance in his heart. He wasn't sure why he was feeling such a thing, but there was something which told him that the letter was going to painful.\nAnd indeed, as soon Luna returned to his side, Austin's hunch went right.\n\"A-Austin..there's something I haven't told you, but for now, I don't have enough time. I have to return to my birthplace at this instance. So please forgive me and wait for me to return.\"\nFighting her urge to weep in front of the man she loves and doesn't want to give any more grief, Luna was about to depart toward the strange man before a warm hand wrapped around her wrist, naturally halting her movement.\n\"I won't ask you the circumstance as I know you will tell me eventually about it when the time is right. But before you go, can I give you something?\"\nLuna, with tears filled in her charming oceanic eyes, nodded silently without daring to look at Austin at this moment.\nShe knew once she saw him now, then there wouldn't be any going back. She would do something which she might regret, so not looking at her beloved was the only thing she could do at this moment.\nAustin released her wrist before he took something out of his inventory.\nIt was a pendant with a beautiful blue drop of water shining at the center of the two long silver chains. He held it in front of Luna's face, which made the latter once mesmerized by he sight.\nLuna stared at the image of the pure and beautiful pendant with blurry vision as she heard her beloved's voice from behind.\n\"Can I?\"\nAsking for permission, Austin received a nod in a blink before he held the alluring silver hair of Luna at one side, exposing her moon-white back and fragile nape.\nThe sight in front was so enticing that Austin found himself drowning in a stupor before he pulled himself out, as this wasn't the time nor place to admire her beauty.\nHe gently placed the pendant on her cleavage before tying the string on the back without letting his dirty hand touch her delicate skin in fear to stain her purity.\n\"This pendant was the thing I bought from my first earning. I know it's not something to boast about, but I hope I conveyed my feelings through it.\"\nBeads of heavy tears were rolling down Luna's cheeks as she heard the words she desired the most to hear for so long. But in this situation, she couldn't even turn her face and look at him and confess her feelings back, at all.\nShe felt utterly miserable...\n\"Luna...I have lost too many people in both of my lives which I have held dear to me, but the fact that you are the most precious than anyone makes me even more scared to think of being separated. I know it must sound sissy of me when I say it, but please don't leave me. I can't think of life without you anymore. So finish whatever business you have and return to this hopeless villain as soon as possible, okay?\"\nWith a broad smile and tears still dripping down her face, Luna nodded vigorously as she leaned her back on Austin to attain as much warmth as she could before she leaves for the battle she had been avoiding until now.\n\"I will, Austin, so you better keep yourself alive until then. If you dare to leave me alone, I will not let you to rest even in the afterlife. So beware!\"\n\"Hai...hai.\"\nAustin nodded with a grin before finally letting go of Luna as she left the scene not so long after following the stranger.\nAustin, staring at the place where  Luna left, didn't move even an inch before he finally lost his strength and plopped down on the dirty ground.\nThe time he looked back in the sky, the stars already have been spread like a sheet over his vision.\nWith one arm under his head, he lay down on the same ground, without care of anything in this world, before a sigh left his mouth.\n\"So I finally fell for her, huh....\"\n______, _________\nA/N:- The separation won't be long, and the confession will be something you should look forward to.\nAnyway, drop a comment if you like the story~",

      "content": "Standing with a big smile on her face was a middle-aged woman with Auburn hair adorning her head and elation covering her persona.\nOther than the fact that the woman was wearing a maid uniform and did not have any kind of insulating cloth even though her background was practically dyed in white with bone-chilling breezes flowing at a rapid speed, what made the woman special was the person she was waiting for.\nThe princess of a country, the person who was called humanity's hope and Priestess of Miracles, was arriving from the door where the maid was standing in front.\nOther than the maid, there were proper carriages which were, instead of horses, bonded with big husky wolves of size more than two meters.\nAbout two dozen men were standing by each carriage in a proper arrangement with weapons hanging on their waist or back and a solemn expression on their faces.\nIt goes without saying why these many guards came when a single person was arriving through the teleportation portal, as the person in question wasn't someone whom the emperor could take a chance upon risking.\nAfter what seemed like an hour since the carriages arrived, the door of the portal center finally swung apart as the figure of a man in his late twenties walked forward before standing at a side and thumping his hand on his chest to greet the person who followed.\nNot only him, but the other guards too joined their feet before thumping their fists on themselves in the union as they shouted simultaneously.\n\"\"Long live the Young Lady!!\"\"\nThe person who they referred to as the 'young lady' and the person who made the already elated maid teared up in joy was none other than the first love of Austin, Luna Eldritch.\nUpon seeing the scene, Luna just nodded indifferently before she walked toward the person she only could talk openly within this nation. Her nanny and her caretaker, Anna.\n\"How have you been, Anna? Looking at your wrinkles, it doesn't seem you have been doing well at all.\"\nUpon hearing the carefree remark and slight smile, Luna bestowed, even only for a blink, made it clear that Luna was doing great in the nation of Gram.\nWhen Luna left her home, there wasn't any specific expression on her face. Anna was used to seeing her young lady wearing such a facade so she could hide her inner bitterness. But looking at the current Luna, the loyal maid couldn't help but feel even more joyous.\n\"I am very well, my lady. Please come inside since it's extremely freezing today.\"\nAfter a bow, Anna took Luna inside the royal carriage, which looked the most extravagant of them all.\nThe other carriages weren't for the soldier guards, but the transportation carried top-tier mages and medics in case of an emergency.\n\"Well, it's not like it doesn't snow around the year.\"\nMuttering under her breath, Luna, with the help of her maid, climbed the carriage before a highly exquisite sight greeted the duo.\nThe inside was far warmer than the outside, with mana stones working as insulators and comfortable couches, making the whole room like carriage, extremely cozy.\nLuna settled on one of the sofas before Anna instructed the coach to move forth.\n*WOOOOOOOO*\nThe howls of Fenris echoed in the surroundings as every white-furred being signaled each other before the carriage started to move.\nAnna went to the counter as she started preparing milk tea for her young lady. After a few minutes, a cup of freshly brewed tea was presented in front of the silent Luna, gazing at the outside solemnly.\n\"Thanks, Anna.\"\nThanking her with a slight smile, Luna sipped on the tea only to sigh in nostalgia and comfort.\n\"You're smiling quite often, my lady. Did something happen recently...or maybe you finally found your prince Charming?\"\nThrough the letters Luna sent quite often to her sole friend Anna, until the recent months, she made it clear that she wasn't interested in Kyouki, that's why Anna didn't mention the name directly but instead left with a trail.\nUpon hearing her nanny's query, a shy insuppressible smile formed on Luna's charming face as she hurriedly sipped on the tea in one go.\nDue to her family relations, Anna rarely saw her young lady smiling in the past, but now, looking at her seemed that she was looking at an entirely different person.\nGone was the aloof and cold saintess. In front of Anna, only a shy maiden in love was available.\nFidgeting at her seat, Luna hesitated only for Anna to tease even more as the latter pushed her young lady to confess everything.\n\"Young lady~ Won't you tell me about him?\"\nWith a slight grin, Anna raised her brows before the cornered Luna finally gave in.\n\"Yes, yes, I found my love after this long. Happy now?\"\nWith a giggle, Anna walked toward her young lady, before kneeling in front as she held her hand and asked for more.\n\"You know how long I have waited for this gossip. Don't hide it, my princess, and tell me about this selected one who has melted this ice lady and made my pure Luna so much crazed in love.\"\nLuna became flushed slightly as she heard her nanny's shameless remark but again, Luna couldn't deny what she heard, so she finally let go of her restraint.\n\"The most handsome and charming man I have ever seen has captivated me, Anna! You know, he made me realize that a human could have so much kindness inside them and still doesn't boast about it. He made me realize that life isn't about selfishness but also about caring and sacrificing for others. The way he handles these many griefs, which I can't even compare mine with, and still how he smiles carelessly like a stupid fool made my heart thump at its highest pitch. I don't know when but he made his way inside the deepest part of my heart from where I could never let him escape anymore. I love him, Anna. I love him more than I2 could ever define with mere words...\"\nAnna, throughout Luna's dreamy confession, was carefully observing her young lady's expression. And from what she concluded, Luna wasn't just in love with the said boy, but she was utterly drowned in his love, hopelessly.\nAnna wasn't sure whether the man, as Luna said, actually was or not, but she hoped dearly that whatever happened, her lady doesn't get heartbroken in the future.\n(A/N:- Flag?)\nThe way Luna was describing her love made Anna glad as well as scared at the same time about any unforeseen future which could make her young lady disheartened to the point of no return.\n'I hope my fear never turns into reality, my lady...'\nSuddenly Luna grabbed her nanny's hand, startling the latter before she heard the continuation of Luna's flowery words for the man she adores.\n\"You will like him, Anna. In a way, he makes me remember you. I am sure you will have a great time together discussing the elemental spells and other nerdy stuff.\"\nUpon hearing Luna's enthusiastic remark, Anna closed her left eye as she said teasingly.\n\"Won't you be troubled, my lady, if I were to sweep away such a fine young man for myself? I am still single after all~.\"\nSuddenly the warm atmosphere inside the carriage started dropping in temperature as Anna felt her connected hand with Luna, freezing at a furious pace.\nLooking at Luna's darkened expression, Anna hurriedly cleared the childish misunderstanding she only spouted on the spur of the moment.\n\"M-My lady...it was a joke! A joke.\"\nComing out of her stupor, Luna stated without much change of tone.\n\"Oh, well. I was aware.\"\nLying with a straight face, Luna retracted her gaze toward outside before the room regained warmth and freedom for Anna's hand.\nSighing, the beautiful maid got up from the ground before she took the empty cup from the table as she went to prepare a hot brewing for Luna and herself.\nWhile boiling the water, a sudden question arrived in Anna's mind as she asked with slight concern filled in her voice.\n\"Young lady...what about Hero-sama? I didn't want to bitter your mood, but your majesty has already boasted a lot about your special relationship with hero Kyouki-sama. Have you thought about it?\"\nUpon hearing the tensed tone of her maid, Luna sneered inwardly. She wasn't bothered because Anna asked it instead; it was the person she mentioned.\n\"As I said in my letters, there was nothing in between that hero and me. He is a foolish moron who hasn't seen what this world actually has in store. The time he would realize that justice and stuff look only good in fairy tales, it would be too late for him. And I'm not going to be a part of it anymore. \"\nTaking a slight pause, the expression over her face washed with a dark makeover as in a deep voice, she continued.\n\"And as for father...then I know what I have to do. I am done with that old man's whims and blinded judgment. It's time to make it clear that I am no more bonded with this place nor with any relationship. By hook or crook, this would be the last time I would visit this place on someone's command, not by my desire.\"\n_________\nOn the morning of the fourth day, since Austin went to the toughest lair of his life, he finally decided to return to his dorm.\nLast night he spent the whole night without realizing how fast the time had passed. The entire night he didn't sleep a wink and only stared at the night starry sky while remembering the face of the person he found his first love in.\nWalking at a steady pace toward the school premise, Austin carried his little sore body with his clothes still in the beggar's state.\n'Man...what does he wants now...'\nUpon sensing familiar mana, Austin grumbled inwardly before continuing his step in the forwarding direction.\nAustin would have avoided the person who was, without a doubt waiting for Austin at the school entrance, but Austin had some words to deliver, so he decided upon confrontation.\n\"Where is she?\"\nHolding his anger and resisting his urge to lunge at Austin right at the instance, Kyouki asked in a stable tone.\nHis expression was sullen, signifying how long he had waited for Austin's arrival and not finding Luna beside him, how miserable Kyouki felt inside his heart.\nThose who saw him continuously patrolling in the jungle and standing at the entrance days and night could only understand how deeply he was concerned for Luna.\nKyouki's party members also helped him, but in the end, he asked for isolation when he felt hopeless about finding his love. The three beauties, even being reluctant, agreed with Kyouki's wish and left his side on the third day.\nAnd now, when Kyouki finally got a glimpse of hope to see Luna, he found Austin shaking his head in denial, urging Kyouki's anger to an unparalleled state.\n\"In actuality, I don't really know, so move aside.\"\nAustin was about to walk forward when a sturdy hand wrapped around his nape before an angry voice made Austin's eardrums slightly numb.\n\"Tell me where the fuck you hid MY LUNA.\"\nUpon hearing such a remark, the previous Austin would have played scumbag and said something to get his ass beaten, but now when he has realized his love for Luna....\n*SWISH*\n*BANGGG*\nIn an instant, Kyouki's whole world flipped upside down, and before he could realize it, his body was slammed on the ground with his previously tightly held hand, holding nothing but open air.\nThe back of his head was aching profoundly, signifying at what furious pace he was thrown to the ground, but what made his bone freeze in fret was the voice of the man, who was pressing Kyouki down on the floor.\n\"Listen, you blind piece of justice trash. When you proudly announce Luna as yours, it fucking irritates me. Next time when you see her, ask her yourself what she thinks of you, then, you might come to a realization of what a massive jerk you are. Now stop hindering and play the hero of justice for the people who lick your ass.\"\nLetting go of the hold, Kyouki finally came out of the stupor as he felt air regulating in his lungs, as he started breathing heavily.\nHe gasped audibly to catch as much air as possible while panting like a dog on the floor.\nAustin didn't walk more than five steps when he halted and called for the hero, making the latter hold his breath again.\n\"Wherever Luna is, you won't have to worry about her involvement in this upcoming matter, so rest well with your fairies and don't assume that everything that would be happening from now on is your concern. Understood?\"\nKyouki just glared at the back of Austin, who clearly told him not to meddle with the matter regarding Charles, and since Luna wasn't involved, Kyouki also didn't have a plan to come forward in the first place.\nAustin also sensed the conclusion from the hero, so continuing his walk, he muttered his departing words.\n\"I think you do....\"",

      "content": "It was the second day since Luna left Austin's side and went to her homeland.\nAustin was aware that the person who came to fetch Luna was the royal guard of the country she belonged to, but he was troubled why such a thing happened so early.\nThe character, which should be popping later half of the story when the appearance of demons would have been becoming regular, were now interfering unnaturally.\nBut knowing full well, how drastically Austin have changed the plot ever since he first intimately chatted with Luna on the day his engagement was annulled, nothing seemed to amaze him much.\nHe had gained sufficient points to fill his weekly Villain's system requirement while he was in the lair.\nHe still was unsure how these points work, but until his job was getting done without him partaking in anything intentionally, Austin was contended with it.\nBefore if, he had the thinking of a person who was destined to be crushed by others, then the support and encouragement he got from Luna, Austin thought of himself differently.\nHe doesn't want to get trashed by others nor look helpless in front of the girl who has stolen his heart without letting him even show the slightest reluctance.\nNothing changed.\nPeople were the same, still treating him like an invisible existence.\nHe was still receiving curse points for no reason; things were moving a little different because of the incoming disaster, but except for the change of lecture timing, everything was like how it was.\nExcept for one significant fact...\nThe previous Austin, who had ever been alone and always seemed to be just dragging his life, has now wholly shifted for good.\nIt only has been two days since he realized his love for Luna when the time of her departure came up, but now he seemed like a completely different person.\nIn isolation or in public, there was a kind and loving smile on his face; whenever the face of a certain someone arrives in his mind.\nWithout her presence, he felt empty, but from inside, he was fulfilled...\n_______________\n[Austin's POV:]\nIt was pretty relaxing when I didn't have to rush for the Villain's point, as without such work, I was able to do various things on which I wasn't able to focus before.\nLike right now, I was studying some ancient stuff related to the heroes of the past and how they extinguished the terror of Demons .\nMost of the stuff was utterly dull, but there was something that made me intrigued.\nBeing a bonafide bookworm who loved to read the most in the name of entertainment, these heroic tales weren't much immoral compared to some of the other books I have read regarding the dominance of mana users over non-mana users.\nI was genuinely having a great time, escaping from my shameless mind, which kept repeating Luna's face time after time and in a way I should not be seeing at this time of day.\nBut what came to disturb my solitary was a weird man which I wanted to ignore for some more time but when the person came to visit himself...\n**Ahem**\n\"I hope I didn't disturb, Sir Austin.\"\nThe one who stood some meters apart from me while leaning on the bookshelf was the Sole Magician who attained [Legend Class] at the mere age of 30.\nVery few people know that he was Legend Class as per his wish to remain low-key, but in my opinion, once he became the head of Royal Mages, he already lost all hope of staying low profile.\n\"I'm not a Nobel anymore, so drop that sir.\"\nWithout lifting my gaze as I knew I would only meet with a disgusting grin, I responded before Alex walked toward me and took the opposite chair.\n\"Well, I don't respect people by their ranks or background but rather because of their strength and actual potential.\"\nI was aware that he had sensed some essence of mana which I unintentionally leaked in the church; that's why his words didn't make me surprised at all.\nOn the contrary, I felt fortunate that the court magician came himself with this topic in regards.\nClosing my book, I placed it on the corner before fixing my gaze on the guy who, as expected, was grinning for no definite reason.\n\"What do you want?\"\nJust like how a child waits for their parents to ask what gift they want for Christmas, Alex jumped from the chair before he started exploring the inside of his coat thoroughly.\nThe way he childishly acts in front of some and how arrogant he behaves among the general public were all facade. In actuality, his true face has only seen a countable number of people. And if one were to take out the dead people from that count, the number would jump back to zero.\nFinally, after what seemed like an eternity, Alex finally found the materials he was searching for.\nSlamming the papers flat on the table, he let go of the hold and sat back on the chair while panting slightly like he had attained something massive.\nI observed his expression for a mere blink, and after getting thoroughly disgusted, I took the paper in hand and started running my eyes along the content.\nSoon, my brows went up in surprise as I read through the first page in less than half a minute.\nI went on the next page and then another one until I finally reached the end of the fifteenth one; then only I halted, my eyes and unsettled mind.\nPutting the handwritten theories back on the table, I looked back at the author of such a weird story.\n\"Are you serious about these things? Are you preparing to destroy nations altogether or something?\"\nUpon hearing me, the expression on Alex's face turned utterly delightful as he kept one of his hands on his chest before leaning back on the chair with an exaggerated sigh.\n\"I knew you would understand my theories. My proud instincts never go wrong, and I was sure it won't mislead me in this case, too~.\"\nHugging his body, he was fidgeting at his place enough for me to get annoyed as I got up from the chair.\n\"Matte~ Okay...I will talk. I will talk. First, take a seat.\"\nHe raised his hand, protesting my leave, and finally came out of his nauseating stupor.\nShaking my head, I sighed before landing my butt on the same chair again.\nCoughing twice, Alex finally started to speak of the unexpected matter, which was never even mentioned in the manga I read.\nThis was the reason why I became even more attentive to this subject.\n\"I think you entirely or perhaps partially understood what requirement it would take to cast such a spell at its finest. Since I didn't have any means to implicate such a spell into reality, I never showed it to anyone but now...I have you.\"\nLeaning back on the chair, I saw the enthusiast mage getting up from his seat as he continued with his confession.\n\"After seeing you understand my concept, I found my doubt and ultimate goal more vivid. I have a hunch that you can make my imagination and the fruit of hard work come into reality. So Sir Austin, what do you say, want to grab my hand and explore the world you were unaware of until now?\"\nHunch, my ass.\nIt wasn't of him playing the bet on me by showing his work which he indeed would have spent months or maybe years to form.\nFrom the manga, I knew that Alex has the capability to sneak into the minds of others and collect their memories worth one month.\nIt doesn't take a genius to conclude how easily he would have used either the hero or any of the harem members to gain information about my brawl against the Terror Demon.\nThat's why I was certain about the reason why I attained the arrogant Court Magician's interest.\n\"So you want me as a lab rat to help you create these absurd spells, right?\"\nGetting a vigorous nod, a lot amount of contemplation landed in my mind.\nI took my time and evaluated various things regarding the future and what I should do to achieve my villain's points accordingly.\nWell, I wasn't even comparable to plan the villain's deeds as Luna did, but knowing full well how far Alex's reach was, my conclusion on the matter in hand came out shortly.\n\"I will help with these things, but in return, I will use you.\"\nDue to a slight misjudgment of my words in front of the wrong person, I was again faced up with a disgusting self-hugging gesture by the weirdest mage I have ever come across.\n\"Use me? How shameless~ Anyway, continue.\"\nSighing, I tried to hold all the frustration inside as I spoke in my most buddha tone.\n\"First, tell me, why are you in the academy?\"\nI was aware that Alex left on the day when Luna and I went to the lair. Also, he was the one who informed the Emperor about Hero's involvement in the matter, which eventually led to Luna's unexpected return to her homeland.\nBut Alex coming back to the academy was still a little doubtful. But Alex's following statement made my doubts clear.\n\"I am here for Hero's safety from the incoming bull as the empire could afford anything but the loss of the so-called hopes of humanity.\"\nFrom his words, it was confirmed that, just like manga, the real Alex also doesn't take Hero as an apostle of God but only as a stupid brat.\n'Well, that makes things easy.'\n\"Since you are here as Kyouki's bodyguard, do your job and keep him away from the battleground, as far as possible. His life is precious for me too, after all.\"\n_____________________________\nCurrently standing in the center of a vast hall surrounded by castle stones and extravagant decoration adorning the insides of the fort was the person in whom Austin had found his first love.\nIt takes almost 24 hours to reach the main palace of the Northern Lands of Aurora.\nAnd after arriving at the castle, the first thing Luna was asked was to greet the emperor in an instant.\nSince Luna also desired to face her father as soon as possible when she had so much built up inside, she didn't show any reluctance before she presented herself in front of the ruler of the Northern Lands, Emperor Norsvolk Eldritch.\nThe current audience of the court was only comprised of selected generals and archdukes who had already knowledgeable about the eldest princess' arrival.\nOther than the emperor, there were two of his queens sitting at the head stage on either side of their husband.\nLuna wasn't surprised to see her mother absent from the court, taking her weakened state, which must have worsened until now, into account.\nStood facing her father, Luna didn't even bother with the formal greetings, which strangely didn't surprise the others as they were aware of the cold temperament of the princess and what emotions she carries for her family.\n\"You were away for five years now, and when you finally returned, those rebellious eyes were the first thing you showed me. Luna indeed has grown up a lot, huh.\"\nSpoke in an authoritative tone was the patriarch of the Kingdom and the person who holds the most significant influence in the Northern Land and some other nations.\nHis face, despite being in his late forties, was still charming enough to charm women without even using his name as bait. The sturdy build he carries didn't go hidden even though the person was wearing a heavy coat entirely made from a Terror Rank demon.\nWith his cold oceanic eyes, he observed the unwavering demeanor and the unbreakable fortitude his blood relative attained in this short amount of time which genuinely surprised him.\nBut again, in his thoughts, Luna spent her time with Hero's party, so this end conclusion was something he felt proud about.\n\"Look carefully, father. It's not rebellion that I am expressing through my eyes rather; it's the disgust I carry for you.\"\nThe youngest queen instantly drew her sharp gaze at Luna, which the latter one blindly ignored.  Not only the Queens but various others also showed discomfort upon hearing such explicit and subjective insult toward their king, but no one dared to raise their voice.\nThe emperor, on the other hand, wasn't much bothered because of the hate he had and was receiving from his daughter.\nHe was well aware of Luna's bitterness for the people of her birthplace, but until she was helping him by being close to Hero, he was okay with the hatred he was presented with.\nSneering, he responded in a louder tone than before.\n\"Hate me how much you want, but in the end, you still came back for the same relations you feel disgusted about. You can't abandon your blood after all.\"\nLuna, upon hearing the old man's words, rolled her eyes before a heavy sigh left her lips.\n\"You think after what happened this time would happen in the future, too? How foolish you can be, father~\".\n\"Conduct your language Princess Luna, before it's too late!!\"\nShouted the youngest queen Elizabeth as she growled at Luna with mana circulating around her whole body and lethal danger oozing out of her persona, signifying how agitated she was after hearing such a disgraceful remark directed toward her lord.\nNorsvolk raised his hand, signifying the queen to quell her anger which the latter one followed reluctantly.\n\"What did you mean, Luna?\"\nThis time it was Luna who sneered before she gave a piece of mind to the audience in front.\n\"I had left the person I love and hold the dearest to my heart alone when he needed me the most. And for the sake, I did the such a thing is enough for me to give a sense of satisfaction toward the obligation I carry for my birth mother. After this time, her wish to meet me wouldn't be entertained in the future, as I would not feel compelled to anyone anymore.\"\nThroughout his daughter's confession, there was more than one thing that was concernable for the emperor, but the initial part made his expression darken the most.\nThere was a part of his mind which shouted something utterly unfortunate had already taken place.\nTaking the formal relationship Luna carried for Hero, which Norsvolk heard from the rumors, into account, and the way Luna said how she left her love in the time of crisis made his mind fuzzy. Still, he didn't want to draw that conclusion at any cost.\nHe could not accept such a thing at all!\n\"The person you love...? Tell me; it's the hero. My daughter hasn't betrayed me and made a relationship with anyone other than the hero, right? Tell me that my concerns are futile, and my dear daughter has stood to my expectation. Come on, tell me, Luna!!\"\nAlmost yelling at the end of his unintentional plea, Norsvolk prayed to the highest god he worships, that Luna denies his fears and gave him the best gift through her words.\nBut nothing goes as one desires them to...\nSmiling coldly at the pale, terrified face of her father, Luna made the scariest confession that might shake the entire nation in the upcoming turns of events.\n\"Oh my, clueless father~ You sure are in for a great surprise~.\"\n_______________________\nA/N:- Fuck...it was long.\nAnyway, just some chapter, maybe three or four, before the two birds reunite, so don't worry.\nAnyway, drop a comment if you liked the chapter.",

      "content": "It's been a week since Luna left the nation of Gram and returned to the place she attaches her name with.\nIn these past seven days, Austin never stopped from his daily routine of strengthening his body and challenging the lair which Luna left for him.\nThe journey was fierce for Austin as the last three floors of the lair were nothing but agonizing and utterly terrifying which made him shudder even now when he finally got one with the final boss of the dungeon, which was on the threshold of Terror rank and close to Mythical being if one to measure from overall stats.\nBut since Austin wasn't aware of the scale with which he should be differing the ranks, he plunged forward without caring about the stats of the monster, and at the end of the sixth day, he finally got done with the lair.\nAs time passed, Austin realized how terrifyingly those lair monsters were enhanced, to the point where they could break through their limitations without accepting the Curse's energy.\nThe realization didn't help but make him even more amazed by the might which Luna carries.\nNow he was sure that in the manga world and the real one, the massive difference was the presence of such an influential being named Luna, who has helped him change the plot by such an extreme margin.\nIf not for her, then Austin might not have attained such stats which he has grown up to now.\n[Name:- Austin\nAge:- 15\nRace:- Human\nHP :- 2500-> 1000 (Limiter)\nMP:- 5200-> 1000 (Limiter)\nStr:- 1200-> 400 (Limiter)\nSpd:- 1200-> 300 (Limiter)\nStm:- 890\nAttributes:- Flames(99)\nWind (83)\nAqua (64)\nEarth (78)\nXXXX (0)\nSkills:- Infernous Conjuror (A)\nGravity Manipulation (A)\nSilent Steps (B)\nSprint (A)\nPain Infliction (S)\nTongue of Spirit(SS)\nDark Escape (B)\nSilent Mind (A)\nIndefinite Leap (A)\nChaos of Destruction (SSS)\nStats Points:- 570\nWeekly Villain's Point:- 1220/2050]\nSince it was the first time Austin saw his stats after finishing the lair, he was himself startled by the skill he had attained through the fight he fought against the boss of the tenth floor.\nRemembering what destruction occurred on the battleground in the last minutes of the brawl, Austin shuddered slightly as a resolve formed inside his mind.\n'I better not use that until it doesn't reach the very end....'\nCurrently, he was sitting on top of the school building near the place where the flags of every nation were swaying freely in the air.\nContinuously gawking at the students who were walking in and out of the main complex, he felt a sigh leaking as he sensed the incoming danger, about which Alex had already informed Austin about.\nRising on his feet, Austin cracked his knuckles and stretched his slight sore muscles before he felt a massive amount of mana approaching from the sky.\n'Talk about dynamic entry.'\n**BOOOOOOOM**\nA heavy and impactful thunder rang across the vicinity as a massive cloud of dust surrounded an object which landed from indefinite height.\nThe students first went silent in shock, but soon the sense of something ominous reached their minds before their feet began to move.\n\"It's him!!\"\n\"He has come...Run! Everyone run inside the building!!\"\n\"Fuck...his mana is making me choke!\"\nEveryone was shouting as they hurriedly stepped inside the premise, where the school authorities assured their security.\nStrangely, even in the chaos, before the dust cloud could have subdued, the whole ground was emptied like the crowd some seconds ago was just an illusion.\nAustin's emerald eyes were focusing on nothing but the person at the center of the crater, which formed upon the heavy blow; the land felt like being hit by such a big man.\nFinally, the figure of a person becomes vivid as Austin breathes subconsciously gets stuck in his throat upon seeing such an intimidating man.\nA build that was far from what any average human could even dream about, along with a towering height above 220 centimeters, stood the man who had the most record of killing his opponents on the battlefield in a single hour.\nThe curly free, fell hair that was draping his robust face made the man even scarier; not to talk about the highly dense mana that the person was emitting as it was natural for a human to possess, made this single entity far above what one could evaluate.\nThe first thing Austin did as he gulped hard was to mutter a certain measure under his breath.\n'Remove all my limiters.'\nUsing Gravity Manipulation, Austin steeled his heart and glided steadily toward the man who hadn't moved a single inch since he made the explosive entrance.\nAustin's heart was beating like crazy as even though he faced the monsters in the dungeon, which could have brought disaster upon the whole empire if attacked altogether; it didn't change the fact that the Knight Commander was above all those inhumane creatures; Austin had fought inside the lair.\nLanding on the ground soundlessly, Austin looked at the man who seemed even more humongous from this close before he heard his mouth moving for the first time.\n\"Are you the one?\"\nCharles, in an authoritative tone, asked Austin, still with his mana continuously oozing out like an endless ocean.\nKnowing full well what Charles meant with his mere four words, Austin straightened his back, and with a straight face, he responded.\n\"Yeah, it's me.\"\n**SWOOOOOSH**\n**DOOOOOMM**\nSuddenly the surge of mana around Charles becomes violent enough to make the already chaotic school ground spread in cracks even more.\nThe heavy amount of energy fermented around the surrounding actively changed the background because of the savage blows Charles intentionally implied.\n**CREAKKK*\nTrees around the garden, along with the walls of the entrance which led to the inside of the primary school building, started to get dangerously affected by the unexpected discharge of mana from a single beast.\nWhile voluntarily letting his mana go wild, Charles carefully observed the young man in front and was utterly surprised to see that nothing shifted nor changed in the temperament of the blonde youth.\nThe current Charles was releasing the mana which could have crushed a person lower than Unique rank from this close, but the young youth was not only able to withstand it, he didn't even move a single muscle from his place at all.\nTruly marvelous.\nSoon the surge of mana which was savagely changing the surrounding, came to a halt just before a person in his late sixties rushed to the scene with a grieving expression.\n\"Oh, look who's here! How are you, oldy?\"\nSuddenly the previous darkened and fierce expression of the Knight Commander completely faded away as he greeted the anxious headmaster.\nTaking the chance, Austin let out a heavy sigh as he finally relaxed his muscles while he thanked Luna for helping him get used to heavy mana discharge during the first day of their expedition.\n\"Sir Charles, there are hundreds of students inside. Do you intend to end those innocent lives in the fret of your anger?!\"\nThe headmaster nearly yelled at the Knight Commander despite knowing the difference in their strength and position. The reason he dared to say such a thing was...\n\"You never change, huh, old man? Still naggy as ever. Anyway, do your preparation; I am going down the hard route with this young man.\"\nUpon hearing the clear subjective remark of the bulking man, the headmaster, as well as Austin, gasped, but only the former one audibly voiced his thoughts.\n\"You can't! Students would be crushed without even being able to pray for their god Sir Charles. Take this somewhere else.\"\nUpon seeing how explicitly the Headmaster sold out his student, Charles became a little baffled, but nothing to the point he would mention.\nHe wanted to cross his blade and know the true worth of the young youth who had passed the first test Charles set the stage for.\n\"Okay then, kid, let's move to the forest and settle this matter.\"\nWithout waiting for a response or consent, Charles began to move toward blowing out trees, only to get halted by another appearance.\n\"Wait, Sir Charles. I think you forgot about something .\"\nThe one who appeared only to raise headache for Austin was the Talented Court Magician of the Gram Empire, Alex Nuèye.\n\"What you doing here, BB? Again in your research shit?\"\nUpon hearing the particular nickname which only Charles dares to utter in this whole world, a thick vein popped on Alex's forehead as he ignored the query and continued with his previous question.\n\"The fact that young lady Venessa was insulted in front of a whole crowd wouldn't be justified if you, the father of such a prideful daughter, would conclude your judgment on the culprit in solitary. I suggest for a fair treatment, Sir Charles.\"\nIt was now Austin who felt his veins becoming visibly out of place as in agitation; he stared at the bastard Alex, who clearly was trying to stir things up for no definite reasons.\n'This asshole has no means of becoming a human...'\nThe headmaster was silent on the matter as until his school and, most notably, a certain someone inside the building was safe, he wouldn't mind commencement of war at this very hour.\nCharles contemplated the matter for a mere half minute before, with an affirming nod; he spoke his decision.\n\"Alright, prepare an arena and invite the guests within two days. Until then, I will spend my time with my princess.\"\nWithout waiting for another second, the towering man walked away without even bothering with the heavy stare he was directed from the boy who, after his initial three-worded sentence, never spoke again.\n'It escalated in the worst way possible'.\n________________________\nIn a thinly lighted room sat a beautiful maiden in her mid-teens with her silvery hair draped loosely over her shoulders as she watched the outside of her window in a daze.\nHer charming face looked extremely exquisite and captivating under the dim lights. The girl, even with her eyes open, was dreaming about a certain boy as she smiled stupidly once in a while.\n\"Don't you feel bored inside the room? I am unsure what the majesty wants to achieve by locking his daughter at such an age.\"\nUpon hearing the grumble of her nanny, Luna came out of her stupor, and she sighed with a smile before she corrected the frowning maid.\n\"Don't bother about it. And in the first place, rather than lock, you can say I am staying here until I don't meet my mother. After that, I won't even think before leaving this shitty place.\"\nHearing such a bold remark from her young lady, Anna sighed in awe before she pleaded as she brought a cup of freshly brewed coffee.\n\"Take me too with you this time. I don't want to live in this place anymore.\"\nIgnoring the baseless request that even Luna wants she couldn't fulfill, she asks for something out of nowhere.\n\"Can you bring me a letter pad and some ink?\"\nWith a baffled expression, Anna nodded before placing the cup on the table.\nIt didn't take Anna more than ten seconds before she brought a clean tab with a bunch of paper pinned to it with a set of fountain ink and feather-tailed pen dripped inside it.\nAnna didn't dare to read the content; instead, she took the liberty to ask teasingly.\n\"Is it for your lover, Young lady?\"\nUpon getting a nod in response, Anna's face lit up instantly but before she could have said anything more related to the thing she could suggest Luma add to the love letter, Luna halted her hand and ended the letter in mere 20 seconds.\n\"Already ...done?\"\nWith a sullen expression, Anna asked her young lady who was in the midst of folding the paper cleanly in a particular shape before a paper bird was formed in her hand.\nLuna muttered something under her breath before she blew the paper bird with her written content hidden inside.\nTo Anna's utmost surprise, the bird flew out of Luna's palm before it disappeared into thin air as all Anna saw was her hallucination.\n\"Y-young lady...that...\"\nLooking at her maid's terrified expression, Luna smiled innocently as she said something that only time would become a witness of.\n\"Prepare yourself, Anna. Soon there would be things you haven't seen before and never had thought of seeing in this lifetime. Something is going to change, Anna. Something which would not only change yours as well as the lives of millions of other natives because of the existence of a single Villain~.\"\n______________________\nA/N:- Let the battle commence fufufu...",

      "content": "In an extravagantly decorated room which by furniture looked like a dining space sat four people in an arranged order around the table as they ate their respective breakfast in silence.\nThis was the mansion belonging to the father, who some days ago broke every contact and erased every relationship with his blood-related son, Austin.\nSitting with his sturdy built facing his family, Vincent Wright elegantly slid his knife across the perfect stewed meat before forking it from the middle and landing the piece inside his mouth.\nSat beside his right was the only wife of the Count, Sophia Wright, as she also gracefully ate food while watching over her children's worrying table manners once in a while.\nThe sibling was sitting opposite their mother as they feasted on their pancakes without minding the stares from their mother and enjoyed their time without any kind of regret of knowing that the chair beside them had been abandoned forever.\nIt was not only them, but even Sophia, who had carried Austin for nine months in her womb and shared the same blood as him,  didn't have much trouble after she found out that her son had been disowned.\nWright's family was moving at their usual pace with or without Austin's presence, as they always knew this change would arrive one day.\n'Hmm?'\nSuddenly the patriarch of the Wright family sensed something before he stood up with his sword pointed in the direction where he felt something approaching.\n\"Ah!\"\n\"F-Father?!\"\n\"Dear...what happened?\"\nAlong with the servants, the three other family members become flustered upon seeing the big man pointing his sword in the open air without anything in front as a target.\nBut soon, they realized why such measures Vincent took, as a magic formation formed some inches ahead of the place where Vincent's blade tip was hanging.\nSoon a bright purple light appeared in the corner of the dining hall as a magic circle of 2 ft in diameter formed instantly and soon disappeared too, with a small object hovering parallel to the blade.\nThe thing was flapping its wind like a bat before it approached Vincent, as the latter mentioned also withdrew his sword and raised his hand to catch the thing.\n'Mana Mail..who could it be..?'\nSince using such an advanced spell to send immediate emergency messages were rare, Vincent frowned slightly. The last time he received a mana mail, he detached a person from his family, so this time it didn't ring a good siren when such a mail arrived.\n\"What is it, Dear?\"\nWatching his back didn't turn for some seconds, Sophia rose from her seat before she walked toward the man only to get flustered when he suddenly turned around.\nVincent held the letter forward toward the middle-aged beauty making the latter baffled. Nevertheless, she took the note, which some seconds ago was flying like a creature, before she started to read the content, only to get her eyes wide in shock.\nVincent looked at his two children with a stern gaze making the teenagers shudder slightly before they heard the patriarch saying something, which made the whole room heavier than it already was.\n\"Prepare you both. Tomorrow would be the last day you would be able to see the person whom once you called your brother.\"\n____________________________\n[One day later]\n[Real Time]\nThe news about Charles visiting the Eden Academy and still not running havoc spread like wildfire, and adding the announcement of the confrontation between Austin and Charles, made the piece of news even more noteworthy.\nThe letter for the brawl between two men, one a veteran War god and another just a school brat, flew around the empire, and the important figures were invited to witness it.\nSince the court magician's letter wasn't something to scoff about, every invitation was taken as utmost importance, including the highest-ranked nobles.\nNaturally, the news arrived at the royal palace too, which gave another round of headaches to the already occupied emperor. But since he couldn't control all his pieces altogether, there was no stopping this exhibition from happening.\nThe arena where the brawl would take place was built in the south-eastern jungle, where the most diminutive monster populace existed.\nSince two superhumans would be involved in the fight, it was given, that the arena couldn't be made of standard bricks and stones.\nAlex was in charge of supplying the materials and helping the engineers to build the arena in the span of two nights, pushing every magic builder to their worst.\nThe look the engineers and workers gave to Alex, was equivalent to the whips of a Snyther, which could kill without practically touching its prey.\nBut nothing worked on the freak Court Magician as he mercilessly threw work time after time on the poor souls.\nCurrently, the slave driver was standing in the stands while gawking at the stage beneath, which was destined to get destroyed even though he used almost 30% of his mana to enhance the material.\nA sigh leaked his lips as he imagined the scenario which would be taking place in some hours before suddenly his eyes contracted like a needle as he heard a voice from some meter back.\n\"Why did you do this?\"\nAlex jumped on his toes before he faced the person who, without even leaving a single presence, approached Alex, and not only that, the said person was able to get on his back which practically was the most vulnerable part of any being.\nAlex wasn't self-obsessed, but he was pretty confident in his mana detection, which has helped him escape various fatal situations until now.\nBut here, a kid less than half of his age was able to sneak up to him successfully, without even being proud about it at all.\n\"You scared the shit out of me.\"\nCovering his chest in exaggeration, Alex complained as he saw Austin sneering at the sight.\nSoon the blond youth walked forward before standing beside the court magician, with his eyes focused on the arena.\n\"What will you gain from this fight? You are well aware that in battle, I will also showcase my real might, which is far beyond what others know. But I can't figure out what would benefit you from all this?\"\nBeing questioned like that, Alex stared at their side profile of Austin while contemplating something which was far from what Austin could ever conclude.\nSoon, Alex retracted his gaze to the front before; unlike his typical flowery pitch, he spoke somewhat with seriousness blended with a hazy tone filling his voice.\n\"You will see when the time comes.\"\n___________________________\nAt the same time, in the particular room inside the school premise, a group of three beautiful women and a single youthful man gathered.\nThese four undoubtedly were the member of Hero's party who had come to their meeting place regarding the matter, which was the most heated topic these days.\nKyouki, along with others, were sipping on tea as they asked Venessa about what was going on with Captain Charles and why he allowed such a brutal exhibition to take place.\n\"From what papa said, it's highly likely that he would be testing Austin first and, if not worthy enough, which, of course, Austin isn't, papa would ultimately kill that bastard in the battleground.\"\nUnintentionally a sigh leaked Venessa's lips as she remembered what kind of standards her papa carries whenever he gets interested in someone.\nEven though she wasn't sure why her father took notice of such a weakling, she was convinced that after the first blow between the person she admires the most and despises the most, the result would conclude with the end for one of them.\n(A/N:- Flag?)\nSicily was silent on the matter as she contemplated something else, taking the future prospectus into account.\nThe most anxious and full of complications was Lilia, who wasn't sure what to think about the situation. She wasn't sure why she felt so much stuffed in her heart.\nShe wasn't certain why despite carrying so much hatred toward Austin, she couldn't let go of this feeling which attached her to him.\nShe wanted him to live so she could hate him as she knew if he dies, she would painfully regret something that she wasn't ready to accept.\nHowever, whatever she thought, there was no way of stopping the brawl which would be happening in some hours from now. So she just left things flow as they were.\nKyouki was silent until now, but soon his voice echoed in everyone's senses as the hero rose from his seat while he stated confidently.\n\"What will happen between Sir Charles and Austin is not something we can or should interfere with now. What we can do is to ensure the safety of the audience and take measures so nothing like what happened in our first Expenditure would happen again.\"\nUpon hearing his remark, everyone nodded, and after some quick reminders, the hero party started to depart for the arena.\nSuddenly Sicily asked for some alone time with Kyouki, to which the other two women agreed after seeing the frown on the all-time cheery mage's face.\nAfter Lilia and Venessa left the meeting room, Sicily brought the thing she had been thinking about for more than a week now.\nLooking at her serious expression, Kyouki became attentive too, before he heard her asking.\n\"Kyou-kun....at the end of this month, we have to start venturing high-tier lairs to gain experience, you remember, right?\"\nWithout thinking much, the raven-haired youth nodded as this was pre-planned how they would be challenging the lairs so they could prepare themselves for the upcoming dangers.\nBut being asked like that all of a sudden ringed a dark bell inside Kyouki's mind as he somehow understood what Sicily was going to ask.\nAnd indeed, his fear became a reality.\n\"Since you are aware of my healing capabilities, I won't ask you to trust me in that field. And since Luna isn't a member of our party anymore, we might have to recruit someo-\"\nBefore her words could have concluded, Kyouki interrupted her with a heavy voice with, his expression darkening for a mere blink.\n\"She hasn't left me.\"\nSicily's eyes widened as she heard Kyouki's unusual tone, which gave a shiver down her spine. She subconsciously held her breath as she hardly resisted herself from falling on her butt.\nBut soon, Kyouki's expression returned to normal as, with a dry smile, he assured Sicily and...\n\"I will bring Luna back Sicily-san. Don't worry, in some days I will complete our team as it was before. So don't think needlessly, and let's go.\"\n.....himself too.\n__________________________\nA/N:- I will surely commence the fight in next chapter. Sorry for the delay.\nAnyway, if you are hyped for the next chapter, then let me know~",

      "content": "[This was the time when Luna came to confront Austin after he was disowned by his father]\nI heard people saying that those men who cry are not worthy of being a man.\nBut I don't share the same sentiment as them.\nThose who hide their emotions from the world and expose them in front of those who they trust are the most genuine men.\nWell, I wasn't concerned about others as I don't regard myself as anyone close enough to share their grief.\nNeither any friend nor any family member grew closer to the extent where I could draw my real emotions out or lend them shoulder at their worst time.\nBut that was only until I met him...\nThe person who was continuously weeping like a child who had been bullied by the neighbour kids and was seeking the warmth of his parent.\nHow he hugged my body with his face draped over my bosom as he unrestrainedly wailed aloud made me utterly...\nJoyous.\nIt was sad that Austin was in so much pain, but that doesn't help the joy I feel when I see him in such a miserable condition leaning on me completely. It generates an enthralling weird sensation inside me.\nLike something was dormant, but after meeting Austin, it has been ignited.\nBut for this insignificant sensation, would I let my Austin suffer anymore?\nAbsolutely, no.\nAfter perceiving what he has suffered and watching his current state, I have already formed my resolve that on my watch, I won't let anyone else in this world make my Austin cry.\n\"You okay now?\"\nSensing his cute sniffs, I asked while still patting his back gently.\n'Ah.'\nSoon he let go of my embrace, leaving me all alone as  I somehow suppressed my grieving cry.\nBut what greeted my eyes worked as delightful compensation.\nMy heart melted at the sight as I imprinted the face of adorable Austin, whose face was covered with tear stains and along with his small red nose; the scene was enough to send shivers down my core and flame my urges to do something shameless.\n'Hah...no...I can't...remember Luna..once you do that ...Austin will think you as a cheap woman ...but why is he so cuteeee!!'\nWith a straight face, I fought my inner demon as I helped Austin wipe the remnants from his face.\n\"I am sorry for the unsightly appearance.\"\nNow that's what I love about him. Even in such a condition, he was more concerned about my impression of him.\nThis was one of the golden qualities which I admire the most, but it also was highly concerning.\n\"Don't mind about it. You aren't unsightly at all, Austin, so don't hide your face.\"\nI gently placed my hand on his cheek as he was trying to turn himself away in embarrassment.\nUpon my remark, I felt his face growing slightly warm as he ultimately went speechless.\n'Fufu...shy Austin isn't bad at all.'\nAfter some more minutes of my delight and console of my precious, Austin asked something as his gaze fell downwards\n\"Why did you return Luna?\"\nThis was something I had been contemplating myself for some time.\nI once thought that if I hadn't seen those memories of Austin and never came to realize what actual situation he was going through, did I would have returned to him after getting betrayed once?\nWhenever I thought of this, only one thing came out as a conclusion.\nYes, I would have returned.\nI don't love Austin because I sympathize with his past ,nor because I love seeing his pained expression.\nI fell for Austin because of what kind of person he actually is.\nThe honesty he still nurtures inside him even though he came across only fake people until now who always left his side in the end.\nThe way he still was optimistic about his situation and was daring enough to move forward even though he practically lost everything in life.\nThe way he smiles carelessly and feel elated upon small to small things like even the blooming of a flower...\nThe way he hides his pain...\nHis caring nature...\nHis otherworldly adorable smile....\nI fell all for it.\nMaybe I was rushing things when I say, but at this point in my life, if I could see anyone besides me, the one on whom I could lean on and support wholeheartedly, then it would be none other than this man in front of my eyes.\nSmiling, with my eyes filled with the image of my love, I answered his concern.\n\"I returned because I wanted to trust you.\"\nHis gaze, which was fallen with participation, lit up as he stared at me wide-eyed, unable to believe what I had just confessed.\n\"I know it would sound shady when I say it, but there was a side of me who wanted to maintain trust in you...something which told me that this person could do anything but break someone's heart. I clung to that thought of mine and resolved to confront you. And seeing you like this, I think I choose the right option.\"\nThere was no fabrication in my words. I said what I truly believed and wanted to follow to the end of my life. I want to nurture this relationship and let Austin know that there is someone who truly and unconditionally loves him.\nHearing my words, Austin's face and mouth parted as he stared at me in disbelief.\n'Cute.'\n\"I know it's still not possible to trust my wor-\"\n\"No, I trust you.\"\nHolding my hand, Austin said in a stern tone as he stared at our joint hand, making me startled all of a sudden with his surprise attack.\n\"You know, Luna, I have bad-mouthed and said countless vulgar things to others as well as you too, but this was my first time betraying someone who put their trust in me.\"\nHearing his gentle voice while feeling his warmth through a single touch made my heart melt as I heard him continuing.\n\"The people who have left me never returned, and I also never expected something so too good to be true. But when I saw you, I found my whole world flipping upside down. The person I thought would never look at me again in the same light came back to me with a smiling face. I can't ...\"\nDue to crying so much, he suddenly choked on his breath and started panting heavily.\n\"Here. Take it easy.\"\nI gave him water before gently rubbing his back to calm his breathing. Sipping on the bottle, he exhaled heavily as he tried to catch his breathe.\nAfter some pause, he said something which I might not be able to forget even if the world comes to an end or eternity passes with my existence intact.\n\"You don't know, Luna, how I am feeling right now to talk to you like this, to feel your warmth, to assure myself that there is someone beside me who wouldn't judge me because of my acts but for the real me. I can't tell you, Luna, how important you have become to me, to the point where life without you makes me scared. So please, I beg you, don't ever leave me alone.\"\n________________________\nA/N:- I thought of adding such small sweet chapters so I could lighten the pace and flesh out the details which I would skip from the main timeline. It wont be often so if you are bored from the chappy you can be rest assured.\nAnyway, if you like the idea, then let me know~",

      "content": "The sun was shining brightly among the clouds and was reflecting the surface with a bright golden glow.\nThe time was almost the peak of noon when the heat was at its finest, and nearly every creature inside their shelter sought relief from the scorch.\nMidst of all these, in the middle of the widespread jungle, gathered a massive crowd to witness something which, even without summer, could break a sweat with the chills of the event.\n[Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I am your host for today, yours truly Alex Nuèye, who is going to present you with the event which we will be witnessing in just some minutes now.]\nStood with his wand in front of his mouth, as in to display it as a mic, was the middle-aged court magician Alex who was handling the role of announcing the commencement of today's brawl.\nSurrounding the host were the most prominent figures of the whole continent belonging to different divisions.\nApart from the Emperor of Gram himself, every other official noble who were of dignified rank was invited by Alex, which included Sicily's and Lilia's father too.\nA crowd of almost 3000 were occupying the different sections of stands as they sat with their family members and respective servants. Since the seats were assigned per their ranks, the audience was comfortably accommodated.\nThe Wright family was also present on the third row from the top, with Vincent Wright along with his wife and two children sitting in an arranged manner, without any particular emotion on their faces.\nThe news about the Wright family disowning their youngest son already have talked about by those who were present in the arena, but looking at the family of four who might lose Austin forever in this battle and still didn't have any urge to meet the person, made the people around, quite shocked.\nBut it doesn't affect the Wright family as, in their eyes, Austin was already dead since the time Vincent paid Eden Academy a visit and severed every tie with his youngest child.\nApart from all these ranking nobles sitting on the varying stands sat a single person at the top of the hierarchy with a vapid expression on his charismatic face.\nThis person was assigned with the top seat in the audience benches as the person undoubtedly belonged to the royal family and carried the same blood as the Emperor of Gram.\nApart from the member of the royal family, the most attention-grabbing group was the party of four which was led by a handsome raven-haired boy named Kyouki.\nSicily and Lilia, after greeting their respective families along with Kyouki, returned to a separate seat that was assigned for the students.\nAs Kyouki commanded, everyone from the hero party had an eye on their surroundings and another one of the battle arena where the host seemed to continue.\nTaking a pause and sensing everyone's attention upon himself, Alex continued.\n[Today, the prideful brawl between two remarkable men, one regarded as the Supreme soldier and another as a rookie hunter who singles handily defeated a Terror Rank demon, would take place on this battleground. One would be taking compensation for his child's dignity, and another one would fight for his life. So without any further ado, I will like to call them to the arena.]\nUpon completion of Alex's exaggerated welcoming speech, an inaudible footstep approached the arena as a figure of a boy in his mid-teens appeared from the shadows as he walked up to the center.\nThe boy, by looks, was far above an average face as his blond hair shined brightly under the sunlight with, and his turquoise eyes reflected the charm which was dangerous as well as enticing at the same time.\nAustin was currently wearing a blue and brown vest over his upper body, which by appearance looked like made of leather. His lower half was covered with body-tight rubber pants, which naturally provided the user with unrestrained movements.\nBy outer appearance, the protective gear attached to Austin looked nothing extraordinary, more like it seemed cheap that even the lowest ranked adventurer could easily afford, not to talk about nobles who order their customized armor and equipment.\nBut even with such cheap quality appearance, there were quite a number of maidens who found the sight of a handsome man wearing such an appealing attire enough to bring a blush on their face and heart race to their wildest limit.\nIt was not only limited to unmarried maidens, but also those who had come here with their spouses were attracted to the young man, who was, even though looking fragile, gave a sensation of strange sensuality.\nBut it goes without saying that they didn't let their desires show on their faces and sat expressionlessly, not to expose their real emotions.\nAustin ran his eyes among the audience, and instantly landed them on the family of four who, one way or another, gave him some resemblance.\nHis eyes only halted on the middle-aged blond woman sitting aloofly beside her husband, for a second before he snatched his eyes back to his front.\n'She acts better than me.'\nA dry chuckle left Austin's lips before he heard a pair of heavy steps approaching the arena from the other side of the ground.\nInhaling deeply, Austin readied himself before the figure of a burly man became vivid as the humungous human approached the center.\nThe man was undoubtedly Venessa's father, Captain Charles, who appeared two days ago in front of the school and, after allowing Alex to arrange the exhibition, disappeared from the face of the earth.\nFrom what Austin remembers, Charles still was wearing the protective gear he was wearing two days ago, which was damaged from places with claw marks and severe cuts at some vital spots.\nHis stoic face had similar cuts to his armor as his raven eyes stared indifferently at the boy who had piqued his interest, and now Charles was expecting a good show out of him.\nThe audience, which was already low on noise, went utterly dead silent as Charles stood facing Austin as the two stared at each other without any particular expression on their faces.\nFrom the stands, the two looked so mismatched that calling them a small canine in front of the Fenrir itself, felt justified.\nThe women and the maidens who were secretly fawning over Austin sighed in grief as once again they realized that it wasn't a regular exhibition but a death match whose results maybe everyone has concluded inside their minds.\nApart from the hero's party and Alex, no one was aware of what Austin might actually carry, so for the audience, this battle seemed already decided even before the commencement.\nBut whatever one thought, the brawl wasn't going to be interrupted by even the highest authority arrived at this moment.\nCharles was a mad bull who knew nothing but to feed his blade with his enemy's blood and continue fighting until he doesn't reach his last breath. Because of his obsession, Charles doesn't allow anyone to restrain him. Not even God.\n\"Awaken, Gladius.\"\nSpoke under his breath was the massive man in his late forties as a silvery glow covered his hand and illuminated the area significantly.\nAfter the light was subdued, what appeared in the big hand of the knight commander was a long sword of length more than 60 inches.\nThe sword was lean with a width of only 20 cm, with a fine edge shining dangerously. The blade's hilt was long enough that even after being held by Charles, the slight leather covering was openly exposed.\nThe blade, even being only equipment, was oozing with dangerous intent like a bloodthirsty slayer , which made the surroundings heavier than before.\nAustin, upon seeing the blade in Charles's hold, sighed in relief as what he expected became a reality.\nAs he assumed, Charles didn't bring out the weapon, which has become a deadly nightmare to countless beings until now and would perform a vital role in the future too.\nExhaling, Austin closed his eyes before a single two-worded phrase leaked his lips.\n\"Come forth.\"\nUnlike the silvery flash which appeared before the long sword was summoned, a different black smoke emerged in front of Austin and soon covered his front.\nAfter some seconds, the black fog disappeared steadily as Austin's eyes also lifted before he saw what he called for.\nA long staff that had a transparent shade near to impossible to see until one didn't look closely had two small metal kunai-like designed metal attached at either end of the staff, giving a very close resemblance of being a spear, appeared in the hands of Austin.\nA gasp resonated among the audience, not because they saw the weapon which appeared but...\n\"You can summon your weapons at this age, huh. Not bad.\"\nPraised the Knight commander as summoning a weapon as per desire was highly difficult to attain, and taking Austin's age into account, which was similar to the hero who still hasn't managed to learn the summoning skill until now, Austin indeed showed something frightening.\n\"I am honoured, Sir.\"\nReplied the blond youth as he twirled his spear with such accuracy that it already made various instructors of Eden academy quite troubled as, from what they remember, they had never seen Austin with a weapon before. And now, when he had such fine compatibility with a strange weapon, it astonished various.\nEspecially Venessa.\nAlex, who was watching the small exchange of the two, finally stepped up as he announced the final call before he disappeared into thin air.\n[Our both contenders are now ready, so without further blabbering, let's the battle commence!!]\nAs the figure of Alex disappeared, Austin also vanished entirely from sight like he also went away in the same way which Alex used.\n**TIIIIINGGGG**\nBut only after a mere blink, a high-pitched sound of blade hitting blade, rose from where Charles was standing, echoing in the surrounding, which made the audience widen their eyes in complete shock as they gawked at the sight of something near to impossible happening right in front of their eyes.\nAnd not only that, the person who was solemnly looking at the arena from the start suddenly smiled devilishly as he saw the scene in front.\n'It seems I won't be bored as much as I thought~.'\n___________________\nA/N:- Let the chaos commence!!!!",

      "content": "Charles Sinton. The Knight Commander of Gram Kingdom's the Royal Order.\nApart from being the captain of the royal order for 15 years, there were numerous other titles that the knight commander won in his lifetime, by his utmost battle prowess and the greed of brawling on any possible occasion.\nAt the age of 10, he was thrown into the outside world to live life on his own and manage the things which at his age children don't even get aware of.\nFighting for bread to seeking shelter to spend one more night in peace, Charles fought all for it and survived somehow, the first seven years of being homeless.\nAt the age of seventeen, he started participating in regular military work majorly supplying water or helping the injured first, before he initiated to showcase his potential in weaponry and physical arts too.\nSince his build was quite big from a young age, people got intimidated by him which resulted in him getting bullied regularly at the early stage of his battalion life.\nThat was when he killed for the first time and after that, he never stopped.\nHe didn't become a psycho murdered but a person who transformed into the worst nightmare for those who faced him with a weapon in hand.\nHe soon got promoted to a higher level in the military but he didn't care about it all and continued to seek the obsession he found in blood and gore.\nHis technique improved as he met strong opponents throughout his journey, and before he realized he already become the most strongest human in his birth land and got promoted to a post that no one could dare to look down upon.\nAfter having a daughter he somewhat became a little steadier in life.\nHe had a wife at home and a cute little princess whom he could return to.\nAfter creating his own happy family, the thought of death gave him chills which further made him turn a little tamer.\nFurther adding the point that no worthy opponents were appearing anymore made Charles think that with his old age he also would become senile and leave the battlefield one day.\nBut today...\n**CLINGGG**\nA kid of his daughter's age...\n**CLANNNGG**\nWas making his blood rush to this extent....\n**TNNNNNGGG**\nAnd making him remember how it feels like to be young again?!\n\"Yeah... that's what I like. Come on Austin, I know you have plenty in store.\"\nShouted at top of his lungs was the man in his mid-forties who currently had such vigor on his face that could pale the young veterans in comparison.\nHis blade which was still hot due to the interaction it had with Austin's spear, was making Charles' sturdy hand a little shaky. But he wasn't upset about it, rather he was feeling alive again.\nThe blond youth who had the tip of his spear pointed at Charles was panting slightly with a wide grin adorning his youthful face, along with the beads of sweat advancing his charm to the next stage.\nFor the past 15 minutes, Austin was exchanging blows with the knight commander continuously without break.\nThe huge man was holding his ground and blocked all the deadly attacks while practically without leaving the ground at all, in midst of the chaos.\nThe audience has long lost the sense of comprehensibility since the time they saw a mere newbie ranked Mage warrior landing a such decent blow on Charles at a speed that was even impossible for Kyouki to follow.\nEven though Charles blocked all the attacks including the first one, it didn't change the fact that a young boy who still only faced one of his life's expenditures until now, was able to make Charles move to this extent.\nThe most shocked was the red-haired beauty beside Kyouki who was looking at the scene like she was watching the secret of the Seven Mysterious unravelings right in front of her eyes.\nThe other members along with Kyouki were thoroughly shocked too upon seeing this hidden side of Austin who was only called a good-for-nothing noble until now, but Venessa was not only baffled but also her pride was hurt severely.\nNot because her papa wasn't able to deal with Austin in one blow but she was hurt to see how while exchanging blows with Venessa, Charles never had to move even an inch from his spot before he gives a clear-cut defeat to his beloved mercilessly.\nAnd here, the person she loathed the most because of reason, that even being a man he never was able to wield a weapon properly, was now showing such skill which was not even comparable to what she have attained until now.\nShe was sure, that the current Austin would defeat her without even breaking a sweat. The way he was moving and inflicting his blows most efficiently, made it clear how above Austin have reached which Venessa couldn't even look up to.\nShe was hurting badly by this realization...\n'When did he become this strong?! Didn't he use fake methods in the battle with the demon? How can he fight like that with papa with such efficiency ...WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING!!'\nShe was a mess...\nBack in the arena, Austin exhaled deeply as he sensed that in between the blocks, Charles also gave some quite decent dents on Austin too.\n'He ain't a knight commander for nothing after all...'\nFocusing his senses on the person in front, Austin activated his [Silent Steps] and [Clear Mind] simultaneously to calm his raging consciousness which was urging him to let go of his restraints, and also tried to analyze the possible route to inflict real damage on his opponent.\n(A/N:- Changed, Silent Mind -> Clear Mind)\n'As I thought, this monster doesn't have any opening at all...'\nA dry smile formed on his face as no possible route formed in his mind even after using the skill [Silent Step].\nThe reason was simple.\nCharles, even looking like he was having the best fun of his life was still cautious enough to not let himself get damaged as per his enemy's desires. He could be laughing but his mind was actively working on his opponent's actions.\nThe two stood their places for slightly more than ten seconds before one of them again disappeared like a ghost before landing a heavy blow just above Charles' head which the latter one blocked masterfully using the hilt of his handle.\nThe tip of Charles' hilt and Austin's spear butt came in contact only for a mere a second before the latter one retracted his attack as he knew staying in a single place for a long time and Charles would entirely break him with his sheer strength.\nThe reason why Austin wasn't using his elemental skills which he has become quite confident in was...\nBecause he didn't want to ruin the fight he was enjoying this much.\nHe was sure that if Luna would have saw him being so careless with such a dangerous opponent, she might have went frenzy and instilled some senses for more than a day before she could have gained some sense of peace.\nBut he didnt has the time to think about her now when he was having so much thrilling fun that it was making his blood boil to this extent.\n'Hupp!!'\nAppearing with his extremely fast steps halting for a second, Austin twirled his spear and pierced it right toward the big wide open abdomen of his opponent.\n\"Not so fast, kid.\"\nSince Charles wasn't able to bring his blade back in time, taking its massive size into the account, he used his bare hands to block the hard pointy tip of Austin's spear which made the latter mentioned baffled for a second.\n'Got you!'\nSmiling evilly, Charles brought his suspended sword at a furious pace toward Austin's exposed head, which if connected successfully could have opened Austin's skull like a watermelon.\nBut what Austin attained in the modified Lair was nothing to scoff about.\n**DHAK**\nThe edge of the blade landed just on the flesh of Austin's forearm which he raised to save his skull. Since the blunt side of the blade was hammered on Austin's hand, apart from the numb sensation, Austin felt nothing serious to get concerned about.\nHowever, the expression on Charles's face became severe as with a frown he asked the boy who was becoming more than he ever expected.\n\"You...are you really at the age which you seem?\"\nA smile formed on Austin's face which was far from gentle before he muttered under his breath as his hand went to flashy work.\n\"Why don't you find it...'\nLifting the arm which was blocking Charles' blade, Austin deflected the edge of the blade, which naturally brought Charles back to his senses, but it was too late.\nMoving his lower body in a very frightening manner, Austin moved his body further pushing the grip on his weapon further down the staff, before he lifted his right leg in the air, and with all his strength gathered in one place, he kicked Charles' heel with the back of his leg.\n**DHAK**\n\"SHI....\"\nThe receiver of such a heavy unexpected blow was naturally unable to maintain balance as Austin practically utilized all the strength he has accumulated in the lairs at a single blow.\n**BAAAAMM**\nNaturally, if a heavy man falls on the ground, there would be quite a lot of noise in the background, but the heavy armor Charles' was wearing, created a crater upon his fall with Charles' humongous body as its center.\nJust at the time when Charles' back touched the ground, Austin applied a massive amount of force at the spear and while coordinating with the fall he tried to utilize the momentum to his advantage.\n\"Hupp!!!\"\nUsing all his strength, the veins on Austin's neck popped along with the heightened blood flow in his arms, as he applied an amount of force on his spear which could have even penetrated a Terror Rank Demon.\nBut the Knight Commander was far above those demons who Austin have fought and won over with. He was a being who wasn't regarded as the strongest in the whole nation of Gram, for nothing.\nBlood dripped from the big palm of the big man, but Austin wasn't able to breach the block by a thin margin. The tip has mostly gone through Charles' palm muscles but wasn't able to pass through, before Charles finally came back to himself.\n\"Quite cheeky huh, but for how long....\"\nSmiling in a way that could frighten any human at this very moment, Charles' gave a very ominous vibe as he got a strong hold on Austin's spear end with his severed hand.\nAustin's eyes became wide as he felt his weapon not listening to him anymore before a sound leaked from his mouth ...\n\"Uh-Oh.\"\n_______________________\nA/N:- I am taking pace too slow?\nWell, I will probably end the fight in the next chapter, so don't worry.\nAnd let me know if you are liking my work~",

      "content": "\"Uh-Oh...\"\nAs the words that told that Austin has made a mistake, leaked out of his lips, a heavy flat blow landed on his chest.\n**THAWWKKK**\nCharles, with the bare palm of his free hand, slammed Austin's chest with a force that could have destroyed a meter pillar easily.\nIt goes without saying that Charles didn't apply his complete strength given his growing interest in Austin, but the blow was enough to send Austin flying back to the other end of the arena.\n**BANGG**\nHis body collided with the perimeter of the arena with the supreme quality wall crumbling in an instant.\nIf Austin would have simply collided with the wall with that force, then the wall wouldn't have broke but just before Austin's back could have come in contact with the wall, he covered himself with mana to escape major injuries.\n\"\"Woahh!!\"\"\nVarious heavy audible sighs flew from the audience as they saw this kind of brutish of attack for the first time since the battle commenced.\nThe fall of Charles and Austin receiving such a terrifying blow occurred in so less time, that those who were in the initial stage of their awakening, weren't even able to perceive what just happened.\nIn the arena, Austin's vision blurred just a mere blink as he felt the heavy pain from the back before he stabilized his consciousness.\n'Fuck...I underestimated...'\nWiping the dripping blood from the corner of his lips, Austin rose back to his feet, with his narrowed eyes focused on his opponent intently.\n\"Use whatever means you have kid, or you won't be able to land damage on me.\"\nCharles, who naturally wouldn't have been lying on the ground until now, spoke in a loud tone enough to reach up to the very last seat of the arena, as he commanded Austin to go all out.\nCharles was aware, that apart from the magic attacks, there was something that the blond youth was hiding.\nInstead of getting pissed because Austin was looking down on the might of the sole Knight Commander of the Royal Order, Charles was getting thrilled passing each second.\nFor him, his opponent's underestimation of him, makes Charles excited and for that, he could tolerate this sloppy behavior of the youngster.\nAustin knows full well that the brawl, would not last long if he uses the spell which was even able to deal with dozens of Terror Rank demons now, so he decided upon his enhancing only his physical might, for now.\nHe knew until it doesn't get fatally dangerous, he could rely on his physical strength, that's what led him to a particular reckless conclusion.\n'Distribute my points in strength and speed equally...now!!'\nShouting inside his mind, Austin felt a huge boulder dropping on his whole body, as an urge of collapsing right on the floor rose dangerously inside him.\nThe veins of his arms and nape bulged as the new sensation poured down his core with his eyes still fixed in front not daring to even blink at this moment.\nCharles was also able to perceive that something was happening with the boy in front which didn't give much of a good vibe.\n'I guess it's time.'\nReadying his sword, Charles for the first time since the match commenced, lifted his leg from the ground voluntarily and pushed himself at a raging speed toward the struggling youth.\nThe audience gasped as they saw the huge body of the knight commander disappearing in a flash from his spot before he appeared just right in front of Austin, with his great sword held straight in direction of Austin's exposed abdomen.\nBut instead of feeling the sensation of piercing flesh, what made Charles frown was the resistivity he was feeling from his blade which wasn't listening to Chalre's command at all.\nThe raven eyes of the bulky man contracted to their thinnest as he finally got a glimpse of what the heck actually happened in such a mere blink.\n\"No freakin way!\"\nAlex was the one who cursed from the sidelines as he saw the unbelievable scene using his spell of surveillance. Not only he but the high-ranking nobles also gasped as they saw what caught the almighty Charles's blade in such an unbreakable manner.\n\"Now....I...got you!\"\nWith his eyes blood red and a terrifying smile on his face, Austin held the blade with only his one hand before he tightened his grip resulting...\n**CREAK**\n*CLINNNN*\nAfter a soft clinking sound of how a glass breaks, resonated audibly between the two participants, much to Charles' shock, before the long sword which Charles have used to slay countless beings before, broke into small pieces.\nThe hand that Austin was using to hold the blade suddenly turned into a fist before, at a frightening speed, he moved toward the big man and landed a petrifying blow on his big torso of Charles.\n**DHAKK**\n\"Khak!!\"\nThe big body of the knight commander was pushed back to almost 5 steps with his broken blade in hand, still trying to figure out what just happened.\nBut before Charles could have even stabilized his senses, a massive intent of fatal danger erupted at the back of his head.\nTurning at a furious speed with his hand raised on instincts, Charles felt a massive blow landing at the center of his palm as he saw Austin's menacing smile just above his head.\nAustin didn't let his fist get captivated by Charles before with lightning speed he erased his presence and appeared just on the back of the burly man, before he applied his strength in his leg and landed a powerful blow on the back of Charles' knee.\nCharles wasn't able to keep up with the speed Austin was showcasing and coupled with the blow he was inflicting on such vulnerable parts, Charles was again forced to kneel on the ground.\n'This boy is improving passing every blink!!'\nThis thought came into Charles' mind before he felt a massive boulder-like thing hitting just the center of his head before his consciousness became a little hazy.\nAustin after landing his elbow on Charles' skull didn't even halt for a second before he raised his leg and tried to kick the big man's face only to get blocked just two inches apart.\n\"Now you got me heated up!\"\nGrowled with an equivalent menacing smile like Austin was the man who if not for his exceptional might, would have become a grandfather until now, before he held Austin's feet in his grip and with his humongous strength, pulled his prey and threw him flat on the ground.\n\"Oraaa!!\"\n**THAKKK**\nSome of the audience nearly felt their stomach-churning as the force with which Austin was thrown to the ground, the imagination of watermelon bursting after landing from the tenth floor, rose inside their mind.\nBut out of everyone's expectancy, just after hitting the floor, Austin was able to release himself from Charles' grip using the vibration of the collision as his advantage, before Austin appeared at a different spot with his tightly held punch only to get blocked at the end.\n\"Heh.\"\n\"Hahaha....interesting. Now come at me boy!!\"\nGiving each other the chills of life, soon the two men started exchanging blows which were so brutal that every person sitting in the audience felt death scythe approaching their nape even though they weren't involved in the battle.\nThe blows and backlashes of the confrontation between the two were enough to make the arena shatter at a very terrifying rate.\nThe way, Austin was dodging the indefinite incoming attacks and countering them with lethal blows of his own, made those who have taught until now in the Eden Academy contemplate, whether they were even worthy of teaching him at all.\nThe most terrifying expression was adorned by the very prideful warrior who never in her life thought that her father could be pushed back like this by anyone. Even though she had the utmost trust in Kyouki that he would become the strongest in the future, he still was far from reaching her papa's level.\nAnd here a mere newbie ranked whom she only cursed of being a sissy and gutless until now, was showing such might that her reasoning capability was fading past each blink.\nThe way he was using strength, the way he was smiling all the time even though he was receiving such blows which could have killed her in just a single impact, and the way the unwavering wit he was showcasing of not backing down, made her feel like her world was drowning and she wasnt even able to call for help.\nThe expression on Kyouki's face wasn't any better as the thought of receiving one or two blows from the current Austin sent a deadly chill down his spine. The memory of when he threw Austin using a single punch, out of the school gate during the entrance ceremony, came into his mind when his body shuddered furiously.\n'What if that time....'\nImagining such a terrifying possibility, Kyouki as well as others saw the sound of thunderous cries from the arena halting after more than 10 minutes since they started brawling for real.\nThe clouds of dust slowly lifted from the scene before the figure of the two battle maniacs become vivid.\nHowever, just upon witnessing the condition of the two contestants, a huge wind of chatters mixed with heavy heaves resonated in the surrounding.\n\"No way!!\"\n\"Am I dr-dreaming or is Charles...\"\n\"This can't be true....this can't be true !!\"\nStood with his lips covered with blood along with a couple of blue and black marks around his eyes and cheeks, and a dozen of scratches around his torso and chest was the blond youth who was currently panting heavily while maintaining his shaky legs from giving out.\nBut what made the majority of the audience, gasp in horror was the condition of the person who gained the title of 'Unbreakable' after he defeated an army of 1000 all by himself in a single day.\nThe person who was renowned as the strongest on the entire continent had his protective gear practically torn from every possible spot with his face covered with tens of bruise marks and blood stains.\nJust like Austin, Charles was also trying it hard to breathe steadily as his mouth was parted while he tried to catch as much air as he could. The lid of his left eye was swelled with a bluish painful bruise puffed over it, making it tough for Charles to see clearly.\nThe debris of the stage has spread in the vicinity of both men standing on nothing but broken pieces of marble mixed with the raw ground, much to Alex's grief.\nTurquoise stared at the raven pairs, as the two stood silently at their spot while glaring with a still wild grin on their lips like they were having the most enjoyable time of their life.\n\"You *huff* tired boy?\"\n\"T-Talk abo*huff*about yourself.\"\nThe audience went dead silent as the feeling of something massive made them sweat buckets as they heard the two insane minds talking about something life-threatening so casually.\nThe sound of slow wind also was reverberated in high pitch, that much silence fell upon the previously roaring arena.\nBut everyone knew that it was the silence before a terrifying storm...\nAnd looking at the two, their fear started to seem a reality.\n\"Don't die with this kid!\"\n\"Same goes for you old man!\"\nBoth of them shouted at the top of their lungs as they conjured a heavy amount of mana in their respective fist before both of them disappeared from their site for the next as well as maybe the final blow.\n\"ORAAAAA!!\"\n\"UOOOOHHH!!\"\n**SLINGGG**\n**BOOOOM**\nA small explosion sent the two brawlers, sliding back on their feet without even being able to land their fists on anything.\nSuddenly the emergence of a strange purple glow between Austin and Charles made the two baffled before they realized what just happened.\n\"Any more than this and our nation would lose a precious asset in vain.\"\nAppeared from the brilliant light was the Court Magician who deflected the practically fort-breaking blows from either side.\nAustin became slightly terrified upon seeing how strong Alex indeed was that he was able to counter both of the attacks simultaneously without any sign of backlash.\nSoon the boiling blood from Austin's eyes subdued making him realize how frenzy he had become some moments ago. He didn't know what made his raging heart calm, but he was thankful that such a thing happened, before something irreversible would have occurred.\nCharles growled at the court magician as being interrupted in between the battle was equivalent to asking for death.\nBut before Charles could have moved even an inch, he saw Alex gesturing with his eyes toward a high point in the stands.\nCharles turned his head toward the direction since he wasnt aware of the people watching him, before he finally figured out who ordered Alex to stop the brawl.\n'Tch...this brat.'\nLooking at Austin's condition as well as himself's, Charles felt breaking the command from the royal blood would be not reasonable. After all, he would never go all out and kill such a fine young man who has broken all his expectancy and rose above the units Charles generally uses to measure someone's worth.\nRetracting his overwhelming mana, Charles soon burst out in laughter as he walked toward the slightly panting young blood in front.\n\"Excellent! Excellent! You have made my blood boil and let me remember my old days after so long. I never expected that Eden Academy could have nurtured, such a fine piece of warrior\".\nA heavy verbal slap was thrown at those who were in charge of martial and weaponry training in Eden Academy, as they lowered their face in shame.\nNot only them but every single student who has been taught side by side with Austin has such expression that said how different their worlds were until now.\nThe palest in the whole audience was the middle-aged man who carries the same genes as Austin who currently was looking at the situation with a face like his soul has been sucked out.\nThis reaction of his was something only those could understand who knows how brutally Vincent once was got beaten by the Knight Commander. At that time Vincent wasnt even able to land a decent blow on Charles and now...\n'What the heck did I overlook....?'\nAmidst everyone's shock and other similar reactions, suddenly the bulking man announced something which might bring a cold hell upon the Gram Empire.\n\"Seeing such might from this young man I have decided.\"\nPutting his hand on Austin's shoulder giving the latter one, chills of something ominous incoming, Charles continued with his high-pitched voice to let the whole place know his decision.\n\"If anyone can hold the hand of my daughter, then it would be Austin. So from this day onward, I am announcing my lovely daughter Venessa to be engaged with my future son-in-law. Now, cheers everyone!!\"\n_________________________\nA/N:- Take some time, and try to imagine Luna's smile when she hears about it.\nAnyway, some of the things I would like to clear.\nFirst, the sudden strength growth made Austin's mind go a little out of control which made him use all his strength without holding back.\nNow why he was holding back in the first place?\nSimple, he knew if he was to go all out then at the end of the battle he will kill Charles, which he didn't want, taking future events into account.\nAnyway, if you guys have query then ask me on my server:-\n.gg/2x6BA2Qm\nAnd if you want to read advance chapters then visit:-\nhttps://zetrotranslation.com/novel/isnt-the-wannabe-villain-too-cute/",

      "content": "Smiling while gawking at the device which the system provided him, was the blond-haired youth who was the hot topic of conversation in the kingdom these days.\nIt's been two days since the memorable brawl between Charles and Austin took place and resulted in something which no one even dared to think of as a possibility.\nAfter the shocking announcement Charles made about the engagement of Venessa and Austin, he disappeared in thin air before anyone could have objected to his decision.\nAustin simply did not consent to the announcement, as in his heart there was only one woman, and the thought of having multiple wives didn't give him a good vibe.\nBut what he was completely unaware about, was that the woman he confessed his love to almost a week ago, would never even entertain the idea of Austin having a harem in the first place.\nUntil he was oblivious about that side of hers, he made a mental note to not think anything otherwise and focus on his single goal at the moment.\nAnd that was to meet Luna.\nHis anxiety slightly increased when he received a mana mail from Luna which had mere three lines written in it, but it was enough for him to assume what Luna meant by those words.\nSo after that, he made a quick plan and the first step was for him to get involved with the northern kingdom as soon as possible.\n\"Ah, she looks so peaceful.\"\nCurrently, he was looking contently at the girl who by appearance looked to be in her late teens even though her skin was pale and her body mostly looked malnourished.\nStrangely, after the duel ended Austin saw that the weekly requirement of his Villain's point was not only fulfilled but also, because of the heavy surplus, Austin was gifted with Mystic Ranked Artifact.\nSince he didn't have the option to study any of the artifacts right at the moment due to the unavailability of the test subjects, he decided to postpone the idea.\nNow he had almost two days before the Weekly Requirement resets, and more than nine days for him to attain the points so he could help his dear sister.\n'Hmmm?'\nSuddenly he heard a pair of footsteps approaching his room before he unhurriedly put the Tablet back in the inventory.\n**Knock* *Knock**\nKnowing full well who this person was, given the unique mana signature that she was emitting due to any overwhelming emotion of hers, Austin sighed in weariness.\nWalking at a steady pace towards the door, Austin heaved a sigh again as he finally opened the door, his eyes landed on the pair of amber orbs of a particular woman.\nIt was none other than the prideful warrior of the Hero's Party, Venessa Charles who currently had a very complicated look on her face.\nAustin stared at her with an expressionless face, and he was patiently waiting for her to speak about the purpose of her visit, but he more or less had a hunch regarding what it was.\nVanessa first glared at Austin due to his lack of etiquette, but soon she came back to herself and said in a heavy yet embarrassed tone.\n\"Can I come in? I have to talk about something.\"\nShe said in a voice that told that she was secretly doing all these which led Austin to ask his first query.\n\"You got your permission from your Hero-sama, to come here?\nWithout any particular kind of emotion blended in his voice unlike in the past when he spoke with a shrill tone that majorly irritated Venessa, he clearly spoke what was on his mind which made the latter mentioned glare at him even more intently.\n\"Do I look like a dog leashed to anyone? I love Kyouki-san but I am not a slave of him.\"\nThe grumble of Venessa didn't affect Austin as he continued staring at the girl while waiting for the conversation to end so he could enjoy the memories of Luna in solitary.\nVanessa finally understood that it was impossible to pursue the current Austin who has changed completely, from the previous arrogant bastard to someone fearsome and cold. So in defeat, she finally sighed heavily as she calmed her anxious mind.\nTurning her eyes gentler than before she asked him politely this time.\n\"Can you please spare some of your time? I need to clear out something.\"\nVanessa respects strong people. Even though she wasn't applying such a principle of hers to Austin who still had her doubts, she wasn't foolish enough to dare shout at him.\nAustin contemplated for a second and soon affirmed that indeed he also needs to be cleared out of this whole engagement situation before he leaves Gram, so with a nod he gave Venessa permission to enter inside.\nVenessa sighed in relief and tried to enter his dorm room but before she could even land her single foot, suddenly a strange spell activated and because of its glow that blinded her vision she was forced to shut her eyes.\n\"Huh?\"\n**BOOOOOM**\nA heavy explosion-like sound erupted where Venessa was standing before she was sent flying back into the corridor like a broken kite.\nAustin's eyes went wide as for the first time he saw such an advanced magic circle, not to talk about, it was conjured in his own room!\nHe instantly darted to the place where Venessa hit her back before he knelt down beside her.\nWithout any word of concern, he decided to change their locations as it was better than trespassing the spell which was strangely placed on his doorstep without his awareness.\n\"Let's go to a different place. I don't think it's safe to talk in my room.\"\nSaying so he held Venenssa's right hand before he pulled her up.\nThe receiver of such a terrifying blow, became senseless enough that she never realized it when she nodded to Austin's proposal and started to follow him too.\nOn the way to the place where Austin decided to have a chat with the amber-haired girl, he was continuously contemplating who possibly could have managed to build such a high-level spell without him noticing.\nAnd in the first place, was there anyone around him who had such a level of skills that could deceive Austin's heightened senses?\nThere were only two people he knew and his mind was leaning upon a certain someone, really bad.\n'Well, I will ask her the next time we meet.'\nA smile was brought up on Austin's face as he walked toward the library with Venessa at his left.\nWhen the red-headed beauty saw him smiling with such a gentle expression, for a second she became curious to ask what he was thinking. But as soon as the thought came, it also went away in an instant.\n'Seriously what even am I thinking...'\nReprimanding herself, Venessa followed the blonde haired man towards the direction of the public library which was nearer than the central library built inside the school premise.\nThe unmatched duo naturally attracted many gazes as the rumors flared even more, with Venessa's engagement with Austin as the major backing of those baseless chatters.\nNeither Austin nor Venessa heed a single mind about such rumors as they finally arrived at a place that was far from reception and was quite empty.\nSoon both of them were seated while facing each other as Austin stared at Venessa solemnly, waiting to hear the words which were prolonged for so long.\nVanessa looked at the blond man's aloof approach towards the matter so she decided to end it as soon as possible.\nCrossing her arms under her bosom which mostly gets covered by the armor she wears, was now giving away the completely healthy texture of her round breast.\nHer figure indeed was a waste being hidden, given the sinful body she carries but Austin's interest in her body was completely negligible.\nIt wasn't because it was Venessa in front that he wasn't looking at her immoderately. For Austin, the only person he could enrage his lust with, was now thousands of miles away from him. And if not here, Austin had enough willpower to restrain himself.\n\"The announcement which my papa made after the event, don't take it seriously. I can't be with anyone except for Kyouki-san in this life so sorry but I am breaking the engagement.\"\nConfessed honestly was the young beauty, as she expected even a slight change of expression from Austin. But to her utter perplexion, he just nodded like he actually wasn't able to hear it at all.\nWith wide-eyes, Venessa again reaffirmed so she doesn't leave any doubts behind.\n\"You heard me correctly right? I can't get engaged with you, since I love Kyouki-san.\"\nRepeating the same thing Austin nodded twice this time, completely signifying that he heard her correctly and accurately.\nBut his actions slightly made the woman who indirectly got rejected so front-on, pissed enough that she extended the conversation which she planned to end at this point.\n\"You don't really care or you are just pretending to be calm?\"\nSince Venessa knew how perverted Austin was in the past, the thought of him leaving her without any complaint bothered her.\nShe never compared her beauty to Luna and Sicily since she knew how above they were in the field of appearance. But it doesn't mean, Venessa was under-evaluating herself.\nShe also received a dozen proposals in the past which she flatly rejected, so getting the same treatment for the first time from Austin that she used for the men in the past, made her quite unsettled.\nOn the other hand, Austin felt that the conversation was leading needlessly but from the teachings of his sensei, he has resolved to not let the matter get over him, so he decided to better resolve it here, right now.\n\"Two things, which made me accept this annulment of baseless engagement, without a single ounce of worry. First, I am already into someone. And second, you are not my type.\"\nThick veins popped on Venessa's forehead as she heard the second reasoning of Austin, as her womanly instincts flared in an instant.\nHer aura started getting shrouded by her thick mana, as she glared daggers at Austin before a heavy voice leaked in between her gritted teeth.\n\"Say that again!\"\nBeing glared like that, or feeling the heavy mana approaching him, Austin felt....nothing more than tickles.\nKnowing full well what Venessa warned him to repeat, Austin rested his chin on his intervened fingers, before his cold eyes stared into the very soul of Venessa, as he spoke in a life-threatening tone.\n\"I said. You. Are. Not. My. Type. Since I know you heard me, get lost.\"\nFeeling death scythe nearing her nape as a quick memory of the battle arena flashed in her mind, she retracted her aura and stood up in a fluster.\nTurning on her heel, she hid her face as a low yet audible plea left her lips before she dashed away from the sight.\n\"I am sorry for troubling you.\"\n_________________________\nAt the same time when Venessa went to meet Austin, a raven-haired handsome youth was swinging his blade alone in a garden-like background.\nHis thick veins which were protruding at different spots of his lean yet sturdy arms, coupled with the bare shredded upper body he was exposing could have made various maiden collapse because of blood loss.\nIt was not only today, but Kyouki has increased his training since the day he faced the slap of reality of where he stands.\nBut this was still far from enough...\nHe hasn't gone to lairs until now because of the absence of a healer from the team, which was making Kyouki anxious day after day. He knew Venessa and Lilia never said anything but just like Sicily, they were equally concerned about the future.\n'Where are you, Luna....'\nSuddenly Kyouki's senses received someone approaching him from behind. He didn't have to turn around to see the person as a familiar yet irritating voice reached his auditories.\n\"Isn't it the Hero-sama? Quite surprising to see you hyped up this early in the morning.\"\nSpoke in a flat yet flowery tone, was the youngest court magician of the Gram Empire, Alex Nuèye.\n\"You need me for something?\".\nKyouki without pausing his swings spoke in a clear tone.\nA wide grin formed on Alex's lips as he spoke something which made the previously solemn expression on the hero's face interchange with complete shock.\n\"It's about Luna-sama~\"\nOnly a mere four-worded sentence left Alex's mouth before a huge gust of wind erupted from Kyouki's blade as he turned on his feet toward the unbothered Alex.\nPointing his tip right in the middle of the bespectacled Mage's eyes, Kyouki's aura changed significantly as a heavy voice leaked from him.\n\"What do you know about her?\"\nAlex, who even after being at the end point of the legendary sword, was smiling playfully as he spoke without minding the rudeness at all.\n\"Well, I heard from the boy's dorm that someone would be using the teleportation portal this upcoming Weekend. I thought you might find your destination if you sail the unknown ship too.\"\nAlex turned on his feet and before the baffled hero could have asked something, Alex already began to respond to it.\n\"Don't ask me how I found such information. We both have our secrets, after all.\"\nSaying so Alex started stepping on the fresh grass as his feet moved forward with a satisfactory smile on his face.\nAlex only walked some steps after he spoke the parting words, but suddenly the pleading voice from his back halted Alex's steps.\n\"Why did you help me?\"\nHearing such a question from him, Alex couldn't help but sigh indifferently. He then turned and looked over his shoulder towards the perplexed hero as he quelled the hero's worries and concluded the conversation too.\n\"I am not helping you Kyouki, but the Hero I trust in. So act before it's too late~\"\n__________________________\nE/D:- Zenon\nA/N:- Drop a comment if you are liking the story~",

      "content": "In Gram Nation, there are five teleportation centers in total located at important places only, the gates were mainly used by the nobility and those with higher ranks in the kingdom.\nTwo of them are built in the main town of Gram, known as Rundecall and Vimbisar.\nThe third one was located in the central church of the nation, which was under the control of the head Pope of the continent.\nThe fourth one was in the capital of Gram, built inside the main fortress for easy access for the king in case of an emergency.\nThe fifth one was where a young man with raven-hair in his mid-teens was standing and in front of him was the place where the portal was located.\nWith quick and soundless steps, Kyouki walked to a spot where he was able to see the entrance of the Portal Building, and as he had expected, the two guards were unconsciously lying on the ground.\nClenching his fist, he finally confirmed that the person he saw approaching the center, coupled with the act of breaching the place without permission, made Kyouki clear that Alex's words were all true.\nWithout wasting any time, Kyouki approached the entrance and, after taking a quick look around the premises, entered inside.\nThe inside of the building was dark and silence covered the whole place which was enough to give chills to an average human, but the hero was not someone who could be counted as the norm at all.\nHis heightened senses helped him to perceive the situation inside, which has been influenced by someone's presence.\nEveryone inside the teleportation center was unconsciously lying on the ground, without showing any glimpse of waking up anytime soon.\nKyouki checked their breathing circulation and found that not only was there not any physical damage to the staff but also there was no problem with their mortality too.\nSighing, he rose to his feet when suddenly the feeling of mana circulating at a hefty and furious pace from the other side of the door, where the portal was situated reached his perception.\nReadying a dagger in place of his legendary sword, Kyouki, without letting his movements give any single noise, approached the gate to the main room where the portal was located.\nIt didn't take long before he could peek inside the room because of the door's partition.\nUpon seeing the mana circle forming at such a rate that it wouldn't even take ten seconds to get activated, Kyouki hurriedly pushed the door and shouted at the top of his lungs.\n\"Stop right there, Austin!!\"\nThe light which was emerging from the mana circle evaporated in an instant due to the disturbance the conjuror suffered from.\nBiting his lips, Austin, who was well aware of the person who carried such a tone, turned toward the source with an annoyed expression.\n\"Why are you here, hero?\"\nWithout any further ado, as he could accept anything but to wait right at this moment, Austin asked without the mind being caught by the hero of humanity.\nBreaching the school property and none other than the Teleportation center was enough to get rewarded with a termination letter for Austin. And it was applicable even if Austin was to be a noble as teleportation portals were no joke, which the capital of Gram handles directly.\nThe hero would have informed the headmaster about such an act of Austin, in normal circumstances.\nBut currently, he had his interest involved.\n\"You are going to meet Luna, right?\"\nAsking with his tone dropping to its lowest degree, Kyouki stared at Austin without having an ounce of shuddering even though he knew the difference between him and the current Austin was massive enough to be called incomparable.\nThe reason why Kyouki was acting so boldly and confronting Austin so head-on, which eventually was making him a criminal too, was a plain simple reason.\nLove.\nAustin stared at the hero in silence for a couple of seconds before he nodded in affirmation.\n\"I don't know who told you, but I am going to meet Luna. So if you will excuse me.\"\nSaying so, Austin turned around to initiate the magic circle from the start when suddenly a big hand pressed on his shoulder, signifying the stubbornness of the other party.\n\"Take me with you.\"\nSpoken in a heavy tone was the desperate hero of humanity who, in search of his love, was even ready to join hands with a person he utterly disgusted.\nHe knew that time was thin as a thread for him, and the need to recruit a member would be brought up again shortly if he didn't bring Luna back somehow.\nAnd to conclude all his motives, he had no one besides Austin as a slight hope to meet the person again with whom Kyouki fell in love with.\nUnlike the unsettled and continuously rumbling mind of the hero, Austin had a serene sense of reason as he looked over his shoulder and agreed with Kyouki's request.\n\"Since it would be tough to infiltrate some places alone, it's better I have you at my disposal.\"\nUpon getting accepted so quickly made Kyouki a little baffled, but as soon he realized what Austin said, he narrowed his gaze upon the blond youth.\n\"You indeed are a shameless person, huh.\"\nBrushing off Kyouki's hand, Austin again started preparing the magic circle leading them to the white continent.\nAmidst the preparation, Austin's voice reached up to the cautious hero as the prior one warned him before they left for the Northern Continent.\n\"Eat this.\"\nForwarding a small green dry herb-like thing toward the perplexed hero, Austin continued.\n\"This is a Herb of Configuration. Your facial features would slightly get altered so that no one can identify you in the Northern Kingdom.\"\nAustin's words made Kyouki even more confused and a little wary of the herb as he asked in a heavy tone.\n\"Why do I need to change my appearance? And in the first place, would anyone even be able to recognize me in that place ?\"\nHearing Kyouki's blabber, Austin rolled his eyes as he helped the hero to get enlightened about his own popularity.\n\"The time you obtained your blessing from the goddess, your face becomes the brand enterprise of Gram Kingdom. Now the chance of people not recognizing the peculiar Hero is negligible, I guess.\"\nKyouki felt a little embarrassed being complimented indirectly as he brought his hand on the back of his head before he averted his gaze.\nAustin, focusing his eyes back on the magic circle, sighed as he concluded with the hero's query.\n\"And I don't think you are foolish enough not to know what diplomatic disturbance would rise if the Emperor of Gram were to know that his precious Hero-sama is wandering in another land, or are you really willing to take that chance?\"\nHearing Austin's reasonable argument, Kyouki accepted his defeat.\nIt goes without saying that, as Austin said, it would become hectic if the empire came to know about Kyouki's selfish actions. So without saying anything further, Kyouki, with his eyes closed pushed the herb inside his mouth.\nA cringe expression spread on Kyouki's face as the bitter taste of the green grass covered his taste buds before he somehow managed to gulp it down.\nThe rapid effect of the herb started to show its sign of implication on Kyouki's face.\nThe healthy flesh on the hero's face became slightly dull before his cheeks puffed a little, and his eyes also became smaller.\nIn mere 20 seconds, Kyouki could feel every muscle on his face moving and modifying before he finally acquired his new look.\n**SWIIINNNN**\nThe glow of the magic circle becomes vigorous, just like the time Kyouki\ninterrupted it previously before, Austin called for the dazed man.\n\"Hold my hand if you don't want to get left behind.\"\nWordlessly Kyouki nodded as he jumped inside the magic circle before he brought his hand on top of Austin's.\nThe two men held hands with heavy mana light covering the room brilliantly as the portal between the two junctions was finally established.\nSide glancing at the slightly nervous Hero, Austin muttered under his breath before the two disappeared from the face of the earth for a small duration.\n\"Don't puke on me, hero.\"\nSuddenly the scene around the two changed drastically as the previous stone walls changed into a stream of binding lights.\nThe surface on which they were standing previously also shifted into nothingness as Kyouki instinctively tightened his grip on Austin's hand.\nThe portal, which transfers a person from one place to another, travels through space and requires a considerable high amount of mana to activate.\nBut since Kyouki was unaware of such things, he only was conscious of his surroundings.\nWhat felt like an eternity, only ten seconds passed since the portal activated and took the two to a far distant land, which was entirely out of Gram's jurisdiction.\nThe light soon started fading away from the surrounding when suddenly Kyouki felt Austin's hand getting away from his grip.\nSubconsciously Kyouki turned his head toward his left when he saw Austin raising both his hands like he was surrendering to someone.\nPerplexed, he was about to ask Austin for such a gesture when an authoritative voice alerted Kyouki before he finally understood Austin's evil grin, which he had previously missed.\n\"Freeze!!! Get on your knees right at this instance!!\"\n_________________________\nAt the same time, when Kyouki and Austin were caught up in something unexpected or not, in a particular room built on the same continent where Austin and Kyouki arrived.\nThe room was thinly lit with the holes on the walls and damaged material of the wooden house, reminding the residents how miserably cold it was outside.\nBut since they were accustomed to such harsh weather from birth, the group of men showed no sign of being troubled at all.\nThe person who was sitting at the head position of the table, which seemed for dining, was suddenly questioned about something troubling by the man sitting to his right.\n\"Chief...our resources are running out, and the way we are using our expenses for military maintenance and other things, I fear we won't survive by the end of this month.\"\nThe room suddenly became a little heavier than before, as the fact which everyone was aware of but still was neglecting for a long time, finally came to bite them at such crucial times.\nThe burly man who was sitting at the head seat heard his subordinate's words carefully before he fell into deep contemplation.\n\"What about the troops? Do we have enough men remaining to land a decent blow on the empire ?\"\nThe head chief of the unknown group asked with his heavy voice as he finally seemed to come to some conclusion.\n\"Since the time people found out that the Emperor's eldest daughter became affiliated with Light Hero, most of the troops left our side and joined the empire so they could get protection from Gram eventually. So now we have only around 2000 soldiers in our arsenal, waiting for immediate release.\"\nThe one who spoke in a fluent tone was another man who, unlike others, was a little skinnier and shorter than the other humongous humans present in the room.\nThe chief heard the piece of news, which made him a little sorrowful but nevertheless, this kind of thing was expected in the military, so he didn't ponder on it more than necessary.\nRising on his feet, the chief extended his hand before he made the big announcement.\n\"Commence the preparation. Forty-eight hours from now, we will attack the empire and bring down the fort and the bastard Norsvolk with it!!\"\n___________________\nA/N:- Mc will play from shadows and use Hero to fulfill his purpose.\nAnd yeah, it's time to reunite the two love birds~\nIf you are hyped, then let me know~\nEditor : Zenon",

      "content": "There's a procedure that regardless of position or power, a person has to follow in order to use the teleportation portal.\nFirst, they must inform the destination of the center where they would be teleporting, using the portal through the mana mail.\nSecond, they have to wait for acceptance for the allowance of teleportation, which generally doesn't take much time unless one does not have any misleading or unclear goal of visiting the other side of the portal.\nThird, after a person successfully lands on the other side of the teleportation portal, they have to give a proper verification of their identity as well as the proof of their visit.\nIf any of the above mentioned requirements along with some other regulations were to be breached by anyone, either they are the mighty emperor or a measly slave, they have to face the consequences until not under some distinguish circumstances.\nAnd when two teenagers, one with ugly features and raven hair along with a handsome youth but clearly not belonging to the northern empire, appeared out of nowhere using the portal, the situation became dire.\nIt goes without saying that the two, who the guards assigned at the teleportation center caught, must be sent directly to the head prison, which was built underground of the primary fort.\nThe reason why these two were sent to the central prison was, of course, due to the possibility of them being terrorists or a spy sent by an enemy nation.\nSo what leaves now was the two prisoners who were added to the central jail of the palace.\n**SLIDEEE**\n\"Waste an ounce of it, and you won't be seein' that for a week.\"\nSpoke in a stiff tone was the jailor who, after sliding the cold food platter inside the cell, warned one of the newly added members.\nAustin looked at the plate, and strangely, he found it edible.\n'Seriously, it's better than what I can cook.'\nDragging his shackle bonded legs, he was about to take the plate and eat the stuff since he was pretty hungry already; when someone called from outside of the cell in a panicked voice.\n\"Hey, you! Don't dare to utter a single word! Someone you couldn't dare to offend is arriving shortly.\"\nA smile subconsciously spread over the slightly tainted face of the blond youth as he comfortably took the plate, and after supporting his back on the cold wall, he readied himself for the show.\nAustin heard a modest amount of footsteps from outside with a dense amount of mana leaking from the newcomers.\nAmidst those crowds of signatures, there was a peculiar thread like a stream of magical energy that reached Austin's senses, further enhancing his smile.\nThe footsteps, along with loud salutes, echoed profoundly before the dark room in which Austin was locked lit up due to the outside illumination.\nThe heavy metal door lifted in an instant as the figure of a certain number of humans appeared in front of the cell.\nAustin lazily looked at the crowd and identified that other than almost a dozen guards, two women were standing in the center of the group, receiving a considerable space from the guards in fear of disrespecting them.\nThe one wearing the maid's uniform had an expressionless face, entirely compatible with her overall aura, as she stared indifferently at Austin like she was watching something filthy.\nBut among all of them was only one person who made Austin's dormant heart beat like crazy, and the numb blood circulate like never before.\nEven though he was elated beyond belief right now, he didn't let his gaze become obvious before he snatched himself back to the food.\nThe guards who saw the arrogant behavior of Austin, gritted their teeth in rage as such behavior was far from acceptable when such a prominent entity descended on such a lowly place.\nFinally, the person who brought such unrest in the previously dead cold prison and the one who has gained the most popularity in recent months in the land of Aurora walked inside the cell.\n\"Young lady, it could be dangerous.\"\nThe maid tried to warn her mistress out of concern, as a prisoner like Austin generally carries secret weapons that they use to take someone important as a hostage or to end themselves.\nDespite hearing that, the platinum-haired beautiful woman who, despite being in her mid-teens, was able to enchant men regardless of their age, didn't stop in her way as she walked only two steps to look closely at the person who continuously was chewing on the frozen jerky.\n\"What about the other one who came illegally through the portal?\"\nThe quiet yet bone-chilling voice of the young lady resonated as the chief guard instantly came forward before he informed the eldest princess in a respectful tone.\n\"Since we weren't sure of their power level, I decided to put them separately for now, young lady.\"\nSaying with his head constantly leaned forward was the head in charge of the central prison.\nLuna nodded indifferently as she threw an emotionless glance at the man sitting near her foot before she commanded the chief to do something unbelievable which he never thought of.\n\"Send this man to my private interrogation cell. Since it seems he could be sly in any group he joins, I would take him on first.\"\nHearing such a statement, a gasp resonated in the background as they remembered the rumors about that chamber.\nOnly those who have been here for a long while know how everyone who goes to the young lady's interrogation chamber never returned.\nThe head of the prison also seemed entirely taken aback by the statement as he subconsciously raised his voice to reaffirm Luna's words.\n\"Y-young lady...is it already their time to send there?\"\nLuna, who was still silent verbally, released an intense amount of mana just on top of the man who dared to talk back at her.\n\"KHAWK!!\"\n**CRAACK**\nThe burly man knelt on the ground while trying not to choke out his life as the floor around the man started to break at a furious pace before the man fell flat on the ground with his body unable to move at all.\nIt happened in mere four seconds, yet the atmosphere changed drastically as the onlookers gulped hard after witnessing that the Saintess wasn't only proficient with her Healing Magic.\nThe Saintess could become a terrifying witch too!\nLuna pulled back her mana from the top of the mana that was on the verge of leaving this realm before she turned toward the prisoner who had just bit on his last piece of jerky as she spoke in an authoritative tone.\n\"Since we don't know who from the main castle is involved with the rebellions, I don't want anyone talking about all these until I don't interrogate everything out of this man. Understood?\"\nWithout pondering much upon the command, Luna presented, everyone joined their feet as they shouted in unison.\n\"\"UNDERSTOOD!\"\"\n________________________\n[Austin's POV:]\nAfter the flashy show Luna presented some minutes ago, she left in a hurry as I was again left alone for the time being.\nIt was fortunate that the hero didn't make a fuss and oddly remained on a low profile inside the prison without using his name as a hero, quite surprising coming from someone who is going through his rebellious phase.\nI somehow knew the reason for his behavior, so I didn't bother about it and focused on the matter at hand.\nI was surprised how Luna managed to act like that in front of everyone to the point where her act started to make me nervous. But when she asked for a personal interrogation session, I finally sighed that she hadn't changed.\nWell, doubting her in the first place was rude of me, but again, when I saw her after this long and felt how prominent and respectful position was in among the masses, it made me slightly anxious about us being together.\nIt wasn't that I was deprecating myself, but when it comes to a perfect lady who doesn't carry anything which I could count as a flaw, it was natural for me to think that I was not worthy enough of her.\n**SHLINNG**\nMy train of needless thought came to a halt as a prison in charge slid the door open before he commanded me in a heavy tone.\n\"Come with me.\"\nWordlessly I got up from my place before the guard went inside and unlocked the shackles from my legs as it was connected to the wall before he pushed me to walk forward.\nWith my hands still bound with the heavy chains I started my walk out of prison with my bare feet hitting the dead cold floor with each step.\n'I should have used potion...'\nGrumbling at spilled milk, I followed the two prisoners as they silently led me to a place further down the prison.\n'Something like this was here?'\nMy brows raised curiously as we started descending toward the floor that was even down the basement. Like a double basement.\nIt didn't take more than two minutes before the last stair arrived as a massive metal door, even more significant than the cell lock, appeared in the center of the place.\nThe two men glanced at each other first, then at me with slight pity covered in their eyes before they knocked on the metal.\n**CLICK**\nThe sound of something clicking, or to be precise, the sound of a handle twisting, resonated in the silent place before one of the two guards twisted the lock and pushed the heavy door.\n**SCREECH**\nThe sound of high-pitched screech subdued not so long after as the scene inside of the room finally became vivid.\nApart from the utterly dark place, which was only illuminated with the help of a couple of candles, what made my eyes wide was the slanted platform, which had four handles, clearly not for something fun.\nI gulped hard before the two big men made my fear come true as they followed the command of my not-so-lovely Luna.\n\"Tie him up and go out.\"\nThe two giants, without words, dragged me to the platform before binding my hands and legs with a special kind of ropes after they let go of my shackles.\nAs commanded, the two guards left the dark place after giving me the same pity look, before the door finally closed with only me and Luna present in the room.\nFinally, from the darkness emerged the beautiful saintess who had kept me awake for many recent nights. But for some reason, even though we were alone, which I thoroughly checked through my detection, Luna didn't have much change of expression.\nBut I kept my useless thoughts aside and raised my voice calmly.\n\"You really scared me there, Luna. Now come on, untie me. I have plenty of things to talk about.\"\nLuna was still silent as she walked up to me, making me slightly more anxious than before when I was in prison.\nStanding just a feet apart from me, she raised her hand and started caressing my cheek fondly as she spoke in a voice that sent shivers down my spine for some reason.\n\"What's the rush? First, let me congratulate you thoroughly.\"\nHer hot breath, which spread equally on my face and coupled with her elegant fragrance, which I wasn't able to smell these days, made my mind go numb but still, my subconsciousness allowed me to ask something concerning.\n\"Congratulate, but for what?\"\nSuddenly Luna stood on the edge of the platform as she pressed her supple body against me, giving me countless jolts of uncontrollable urges before she whispered something in my ears which broke all my wild thoughts in an instant.\n\"Of course, because of the new relationship you formed in my absence~.\"\nHearing her cold voice, which was far from pleased, my face went pale as only one thing landed on my consciousness regarding my current messed up situation.\n'F*** My Life.'\n____________________________________\nA/N:- Only fate awaits for Austin as he witnesses the Yandere side of Luna. It's just her way of showing her love. The Yandere way of course~.\nDrop a comment if you are liking the story!\nEditor : Zenon",

      "content": "\"You okay now?\"\nAustin asked as he had sensed Luna's trembling shoulder and small sniffs which halted for some seconds.\nEven though Luna tied him up and seemed that she would be pushing him for the non-consensual engagement he was forced into, she did nothing significant to him.\nApart from the torn sleeves and red teeth mark on his arm and shoulder blades, which Luna served as a way to show her anger, there was nothing she did more than that as a punishment.\nBut for Austin, seeing Luna's crying figure because of him was the most painful retribution. He tried to soothe her after he forcefully tore the ropes, but Luna calmed down only after half an hour.\nCurrently lying in his embrace like a distressed damsel, Luna didn't lift her face as she confessed something in a meek voice.\n\"I missed you.\"\nA wide grin, completely betraying the image that Austin which he has created nowadays in the Eden Academy, spreaded on his face as he slowly tightened his embrace than before.\n\"I know that's why I came here as soon as I finished my stuff.\"\nStating the utmost priority, he gave to his love, Austin again felt a tug on his clothes as a low, grumbling voice reached up to his ears.\n\"I hate you.\"\nThis time he sighed in awe as he saw the adorable pout adorning the beautiful Saintess, so he asked in his previous tone.\n\"Is it about the engagement?\"\nLuna instantly shook her head but didn't lift her face nor try talking again.\nAustin, in the absence of hints, rummaged through his mind and thought of the possible reason which rewarded him with such cute pouts.\n\"If it's not Venessa, then is it about the fight? Wait, since you know about the engagement, then you must have seen the match, right?\"\nLuna, in an instant, nodded once, before she clutched Austin's clothes as a memory flashed in her mind, making her heart anxious.\nBut the oblivion Austin didn't notice her distress as he asked something casually.\n\"How was it? Did I impress you?\"\nAfter somewhat dueling with Charles, a sense of pride was born inside Austin, and knowing that the girl he wanted to pursue was also watching the match ....he thought he would at least receive some compliments and some kisses too....?\nBut life doesn't go as one wants it to...\n\"You were utterly reckless.\"\nThe previously anticipated smile of Austin faded in an instant as Luna finally shot her head upward, matching her narrowed gaze with him.\n\"Didn't I tell you, Austin, you shouldn't follow this chivalry and such if you want to survive in this world? If you had used your spell, the battle would have concluded within a minute, and nothing would have managed to damage you. Not to talk about the sudden power-up you used. Have you ever thought about what would have happened if your body couldn't have handled that much boost and fallen right there and then? Have you ever thought about what would have happened to me? What would I have done without you?! Have you ever thought about it?!\"\nAs her words continued, beads of heavy tears started to form in the corner of her oceanic eyes. Austin was so occupied with her reprimanding and self-reflection that he noticed Luna's grief only after she nearly shouted at the end.\n\"Hey...hey...don't cry, okay? I am sorry. Look, I am not hurt from anywhere at all. That Knight Commander wasn't even able to inflict decent damage on me. I am completely fine Luna, so please stop crying; it hurts to see you like this.\"\nAustin tried his best to hold himself together as he consoled the broken Luna gently. He knew that the way he fought was reckless, but still, even though he saw Luna like this, he wasn't guilty of his behavior in the arena which was strange.\nLuna was also well aware of this side of Austin, which made her heart clench more for the possible future where he might use such incautious methods to win something, and sadly there was nothing she could do to stop him.\nThe only possible way to keep him safe from partaking in something irreversible, was something Luna had already formed her resolve upon.\nThe couple who reunited after so many long days (from their perception), held each other dearly while feeling the other one's warmth and keeping themselves solely occupied with the presence of the person they love the most.\nLuna, after wailing out all of her accumulated emotions, seemed to calm down a little as she let herself get pampered by her beloved.\nAustin used fresh tissues which he had stored in his inventory to wipe the tear stains off her delicate skin gently. Once again, Austin realized how fluffy and precious her cheeks were.\nThe thought of biting them rose instantly inside his mind, but soon, he shooed off his evil thoughts and finished cleaning her face.\nLuna stabilized her back as she sat facing Austin with a slight guilty gaze because of the way she shouted at her beloved even though they had met after so long.\nHer gaze instinctively fell on the shoulder, which had her own teeth marks designed with reddish clotted blood around the effect.\nShe instantly raised one of her hands to use her healing spell, only to get interrupted by an extensive and warm hand.\n\"Don't.\"\nLuna became perplexed as she tilted her head toward Austin, who was smiling contentedly.\nWith worries clouding her eyes, Luna asked the reason, only to get surprised in the end.\n\"These marks prove how worried you were about me, and even if it sounds weird, this pain is a sign of love that I want to last long. So please don't ignore my intentions, Luna.\"\nLuna, for a couple of seconds, became completely senseless as the overwhelming love she felt from the man she adores the most confessed his thoughts honestly.\n'This man...is  not fair!!'\nComplaining inwardly, an unfamiliar heat that she had only come to understand after she met Austin, covered her face as she hid herself in Austin's chest, digging herself in the deepest part, not to show him such a melted state.\nShe was dearly missing her previous indifferent and cold attitude she used to carry around as after meeting this unfair man, she has lost count of how many times she has fallen into his traps and shown such a typical maiden-like expression.\nAustin, however, was thoroughly amused by such a sight, and he even let out tiny giggles as he felt how meekly Luna was trying to dig her face in order to hide herself from him.\n\"Spop lafin...\"\n(A/N:- Stop laughing)\nWith her voice muffled because of her current state, she complained before Austin felt another sweet bit on his collar bone.\nSmiling contently, Austin brought his other hand over the silvery hair of his bullied Luna before he started stroking them as he whispered lovingly.\n\"There~there. My Luna is a good girl~.\"\n______________________\nAt the same time, when the two love birds were dwelling in their pink world, a very profound meeting was being held in the central palace of the kingdom of Gram.\nThe vast room with furniture and decor looked like a reception hall, and there were two people who were conversing not-so-casually under the big chandelier, taking into account, the hall indeed seemed built for legal purposes.\nThese two men, varying in age, had a lot of resemblances in common, which was to be expected from the same genes they share.\nThe older one was the renowned Emperor of the most influential Nation of Gram, who was called for an essential purpose.\nThe younger one was the second prince of the nation and the most probable heir to take over the throne, Mikhail der Gramduör.\nSome days ago, the second prince was ordered by his father to attend an event in his stead, which basically was a brawl between two unbalanced participants.\nThe only reason why Mikhail even bothered to stay until the commencement was the admiration he carries for Charles; that he didn't want to disrespect the battle by leaving abruptly.\nBut when he saw the whole match, he became utterly baffled and thrilled to the point where he requested a meeting with the Emperor right away after returning.\nBut since the Supreme entity of the nation doesn't get his time freed whenever he desires, it was only after four days, when the father and son were able to hold this long-awaited conversation.\nSince William heard some part of the news about the battle already before this meeting, when Mikhail started to talk about the brawl, William's expression wasn't much different from a person who was listening to everyday events.\nBut as Mikhail's words continued to the point where Austin threw Charles on the ground and also when he was forcing the almighty Knight commander mercilessly, William's expression shifted to a brighter and enthralled end.\nWith disbelief clouding his comprehensibility, William asked in an anxious tone only after his son concluded his report.\n\"Are you sure this useless brat of Count Vincent did as you said? There isn't any fabrication in your words, right?\"\nMikhail frowned slightly, being doubted but nevertheless cleared his words with utmost confidence.\n\"I vow on my name as the nation's prince that what I said is all true and verified. Captain Charles was pushed to a corner by a boy whom I didn't even know four days ago.\"\nWilliam, hearing the unbreakable remark of his son, fell into deep contemplation as he listened to his strangely over-enthusiast son continuing.\n\"Father, we need people like Austin besides the Hero. People like him would lead the hero toward humanity's greatest crisis while supporting him in every possible way. We need to bind him to the nation as soon as possible, father.\"\nWilliam didn't respond to his son's plea, but he thought the same. Since Count Vincent had severed his ties with Austin, there was a high possibility for such young talent to be stolen by other nations who were greedily waiting for the downfall of Gram.\n\"Do you have any suggestions, Mikhail?\"\nAsked in a rich voice was the Emperor as in his current fuzzy mind, which still hasn't recovered from the news of the battle, William wasn't able to draw any idea currently.\nMikhail didn't halt for even a second before responding as it seemed he had prepared the answer to such a query beforehand.\n\"How about Tiara, father?\"\nUpon hearing the eldest princess' name, William's eyes went wide. He turned his head toward the prince in disbelief but looking at the latter one's expression; it didn't seem Mikhail said such things casually.\nBut before William could have said anything in response, suddenly the reception door was pushed apart as a man wearing a black shroud all over, entered inside hurriedly.\nThe two seated men instantly turned themselves toward the intruder, who immediately bowed upon arriving.\n\"I extremely apologize for the sudden intrusion, my lord, but a matter requires your immediate attention.\"\nUpon hearing his trusted spy acting in such an unusual way, William frowned before he asked.\n\"What's the matter, Rito?\"\nHearing his master's approval to continue, Rito opened his mouth to speak the news he received just some hours ago, which made the two blonde men freeze in dread.\n\"This morning, Hero-sama, along with Sir Austin, illegally infiltrated the Teleportation center and used the portal to reach the Northern Empire.\"\n_______________________\nA/N:- Next chapter will be filled with lots of sugar.\nDrop a comment if you are hyped~\nEditor : Zenon#4120",

      "content": "\"Tell me if it hurts.\"\n\"Mmm.\"\nCurrently, in an elegant and peaceful space which by furnishing looked like a bedroom, inside of it could be seen two figures.\nThe room had primarily dyed covers all around with a blue color. From curtains to sheets, everything mostly belonged to a similar shade.\nApart from the reception area, which had several couches and resting sofas arranged properly, there was a separate space for bedding.\nA blonde man was currently lying down on the comfortable queen-sized bed as he pressed himself flat with only a piece of short garment on his lower half.\nThe currently troubled man was none other than Austin, who was presently getting treated by Luna.\nThe part of his shoulder blades and arm where she bit were now covered with bandages after she washed it and cleansed it using antiseptic.\nAfter that, she applied balm at the places where Austin received damage in the battle with Charles.\nSince he departed for the Northern Empire only some days after the duel, his body couldn't recover from all the internal injury Charles inflicted on him.\nAfter thoroughly inspecting his upper body, Luna went instantly to run the lotion on Austin's feet, which because of the unnatural cold of the place, had become blue and red.\nThe way she was gently treating him and applying the medicines seemed like she was handling the most significant entity whose life was the most crucial to be saved, made the title of her being a Saint feel worthy.\nBut there was one essential thing that Austin was contemplating since the time Luna took charge of healing him.\nHe, without a doubt, was more than happy being treated by such a beautiful woman with such gentle care, but this situation would have suited him more if this world was the same as his previous one.\nLastly, seeing her beads of sweat which she was paying nonexisting attention to and was continuously working hard to cover him in the greenish cream, Austin raised his voice in objection.\n\"Umm...Luna? Wouldn't it be fine to use your healing spell?\"\nKnowing what level of Healing spell she had in store, which eventually gave her the title of being the Light of Hope, Austin suggested the most accessible means to get over with the labor.\nBut when he received the cold glance of his beloved, he realized he spoke something wrong.\n\"Am I not allowed to see some of your skin?\"\nAustin, upon hearing the word 'Some of your skin', fell speechless, as he laid his back down on the pillow and let the lady do as she desired.\nLuna, taking his silence in the way she wanted, smiled merrily as she continued applying the green gel on her beloved's precious skin gently.\nAustin, staring at the ceiling leisurely, seemed to remember something as he called for Luna in a sheepish voice.\n\"Luna...did you read my memories without me being aware of it?\"\nLuna's moving hand halted for a mere blink which didn't go unnoticed by Austin, further making his doubt clear.\n\"Hmm...and why do you think so?\"\nWith her voice still carrying the previous fluency, Luna asked in counter as she continued her treatment.\n\"The letter you wrote to me made it clear that you want me to change the Northern Kingdom and take it under my influence. But if you haven't been aware of my knowledge of this world, then I don't think you would have written such a letter to me at all.\"\nLuna, after hearing his to-the-point remark, finally concluded her treatment as she turned her head toward the man who still was gawking at the ceiling aloofly.\n\"And what if I say that I indeed had read your memories even before you told me about your past? Will you regret loving me?\"\nAustin instantly frowned as he supported his back and got up, startling the other one.\n\"Do you really think, Luna, that I confessed my love just because of your sympathy that night? Do you believe my words and emotions are shallow, which makes you doubt my feelings? Please look into my eyes and tell me if you felt any of it, Luna.\"\nHearing his oppressive tone for the first time, Luna felt her heart shaking as she didn't dare to lift her gaze at all.\nShe knew Austin wasn't lying when he said that he generally doesn't make any relationships for fear of losing someone dear to him, but when he does build a connection, he does his best to keep things up.\nAnd she was the first person in both his lives with whom he got involved romantically, yet she ended up doubting his confession and made fun of his feelings.\nThe blunder she made had no compensation even if she apologizes for the whole day, so she only kept her head leaning down in shame.\nSuddenly to her utmost surprise, a big hand wrapped around her shoulder and she was pulled on the bed before she could even yelp.\n\"Now, stop making that face. I know you didn't mean to hurt me.\"\nWithout even letting her realize where she was landing, Austin planted her head on his chest as he patted her silky silver hair lovingly.\nLuna instinctively brought her hand over Austin's upper body as she widened her eyes by being enveloped in such gentle warmth.\nAustin silently ran his hand across her delicate hair as he also helped to calm her anxious heart along with his caresses.\nAfter some moments, when finally her state of mind calmed down a bit, she whispered meekly while enjoying the pleasure.\n\"I am sorry for doubting your feelings. I promise I won't say such a thing ever again.\"\nAustin sighed in relief as he felt slightly bad for scolding Luna, but in the end, what he said was all true, so in a gentle tone, he replied.\n\"Mm. It's fine.\"\nThe pair of two love birds were enjoying each other's warmth with practically significantly less amount of clothing over their bodies.\nAustin was nearly naked, lying with Luna in his embrace, who only had a one-piece dress over her sinful body, which reached only up to her thighs.\nNot to talk about the deep cleavage that her dress was exposing made it challenging for Austin to look at her properly. The most prominent thing he remembered from the one long glance he had at her partially exposed bust was the small mole on her left breast.\nHe wasn't a pervert, but with this much exposure, he couldn't just ignore it too.\nThankfully, before his focus could've been diverted strangely, Luna pulled him out of his stupor.\n\"What have you thought about the empire, Austin?\"\nThe way she asked casually and the things she wrote in her letter were about an entire Nation's future, yet Austin was still calm as he whispered while staring at the white ceiling.\n\"Well, for now, I want you to do some things for me.\"\nWithout any contemplation, Luna hummed in response before she heard him continuing.\n\"First, help me to deal with the messenger who came to take you, as he is the only person who has seen me in Gram.\"\nUpon hearing his request, Luna felt her admiration for him increasing, as such a detailed plan was no joke to form.\n\"Don't worry, I will deal with him.\"\nFor some reason, Austin didn't want to ask how she would deal with the man, so he continued his requests.\n\"Second, I want you to keep the record of mine and the hero's crime out of the emperor's knowledge at any cost, or this plan would shatter into pieces.\"\nWith a profound expression, Luna pondered upon something before she finally affirmed his words.\n\"Don't worry. I don't think the central council would ever take an interest in such minor matters as regulation treason, but still, I will lay around my wires to keep everything secluded.\"\nAustin patted her head gently in praise, upon which, the severe expression of Luna instantly melted into a happy grin as she enjoyed the pampering.\n\"Last but not least, I want you to help me meet your long-lost uncle, who has been living in the shadows for some years now.\"\nLuna, upon hearing the mention of the relative she practically had only seen when she was in the cradle, opened her eyes in concern as she informed Austin of something which he might not be aware of.\n\"Umm...Austin, I can arrange a meeting with uncle Nordeik, since I know where he is hiding but are you sure about it? That man, even being stronger than my father if it's about physical might, still wasn't able to overtake the throne just because of the absence of mana. Do you think he would be helpful?\"\nA slight smile formed on Austin's lips as what he had seen in the manga, which Luna also must have seen through his memories, the character of Eldritch's forgotten warrior wasn't appropriately justified.\nEven though there was a brief appearance of Norsvolk's brother in the manga, Austin could perceive what potential the man carried, which helped him in forming this plan too.\n\"Don't worry; I have kept things sorted. If everything goes as I have planned, then within three weeks, the Nation of Aurora will greet their new king, and we will enjoy the show from the shadows.\"\n_______________________\nA/N:- Sorry for the short chapter, but adding info dumps isn't my thing. I will keep things moving at a decent pace and take at least around a dozen or maybe more chapters to clear this Northern Succession arc.\nDrop a comment if you are hyped for the story~\nImportant note:- Since Austin wasn't multilingual, he used a translating artifact to be able to understand the guard of the jail and respond to them causally. Since this artifact is not visible to the naked eye, it wasn't snatched away from Austin along with his other equipment.\nEditor : Zenon",

      "content": "In a colossal hall which was decorated with the most exquisite furnishing and tens of expensive-looking chandeliers, pointed downwards at the main entrance of the courtroom.\nThe unique gold originated materials, which were used to build the palace, made it clear to which nation it belonged to.\nCurrently, in the main hall of the Gram palace, where only high-profiled officials were allowed to enter, was now occupied by a relatively high-density of populace.\nThe hall had finely arranged resting sofas, where the nobles belonging to the high class were seated, according to their post.\nAmong those nobles, there was a blond man in his late thirties who had a more severe expression currently tainting his charismatic features.\nAnd not only him, but the other nobles too, had some kind of similar expression as they fixed their gaze upon the person who was standing at the center of the hall, currently facing the supreme Emperor.\nApart from the adult nobles, there was a single girl too in the court, currently seated beside her father and the Grand Duke of the nation.\nUndoubtedly she was the supporter mage warrior of the hero's party, Sicily.\nAfter receiving the news about Kyouki's disappearance, her world seemed to flip upside down as this was the first time in six months that she wouldn't be able to ensure Kyouki's safety by herself.\nWhen Sicily learned from the investigation that Kyouki had gone to the Northern Kingdom, her heart clenched even more.\nShe was aware of whom Kyouki could have gone to meet in the white continent.\nThe fact that Luna belonged to the Northern Empire was something Sicily was informed about since the first day she met the Aurorean Princess(Luna).\nHer dad being the adviser and a close friend of the Emperor, gave Sicily some perks for herself too.\nThe reason why even after seeing Kyouki in such a miserable state when Luna suddenly left, Sicily didn't let herself confess Luna's whereabouts, which was, of course, because of her own selfishness.\nIt goes without saying that a woman in love would never want her man to pursue a woman who oozes with nothing but danger.\nSicily never trusted Luna since day one, as she knew Luna was hiding something and was far from completely honest with the people she shared personal space with.\nThe reason why Sicily was forcing new recruitment just after Luna's disappearance was also related to her distress in the Northern Princess, who didn't even find Kyouki worthy enough to let him know her origin.\nSicily wanted to end this chapter once and for all, and Luna traveling back to her birth land was the right opportunity, yet...\n'It seems our love was not enough to stop you, Kyou. You indeed can't live without her.'\nSmiling dryly while trying her best to hold her tears, Sicily focused on the courtroom again, where the main briefing was about the incident which happened more than a day ago.\nIn the center of current attention was the mage, who was the only person able enough to track the space and time magic that the teleportation portal utilizes to send people from one part to another of the planet.\nUndoubtedly, the mage was none other than the supreme of Court Magicians, Alex Nuèye.\n\"My lord, I have thoroughly analyzed and studied the mana signature which the passage left as a trail. I am confident that the portal Austin and the hero used was set for the Northern Kingdom as their destination.\"\nThose who heard this statement for the third time just because the Emperor couldn't trust the words of the court magician, remained speechless.\nThe Emperor, along with the second Prince Mikhail, was utterly baffled and profoundly disturbed too.\nThe hero is the greatest asset of the nation regardless of his current power level as, since the time the hero was bestowed with the Blessing, he was destined to shine over humanity one day.\nBeing the Emperor of the nation where the Hero was a resident, naturally brought countless fortunes and good wills of neighboring countries.\nBut it was also very well known, how those nations only wore a facade when they extended their friendship to Gram and were greedily waiting to snatch the Hero, using any of the circumstances necessary, and enjoy the downfall of The Golden Kingdom.\nAnd looking at the current situation, Emperor William felt something which he feared the most had actually taken place.\nTurning his eyes, William glanced at the man who was assigned the position as a foreign affair of Gram.\n\"Have we received any news from Aurora?\"\nDespite having zero hopes, William asked his employee only to get his expectancy fulfilled.\n\"Nothing, my lord. Neither any mana mail nor any physical letter has left the Northern Capital for Gram in these 36 hours.\"\nThe hall again fell into dead silence as the piece of information resonated heavily, reminding again how mysteriously everything happened right under their nose.\nThis time, adjusting his gaze upon his most trusted adviser, Duke Reynold, William asked in a heavy tone.\n\"Do you know how we should sort this problem, Rey?\"\nWilliam's gaze, for a blink, also fell on his friend's daughter, whom he saw after quite a long time, but since it wasn't time to have a casual chat with her, William just focused on the lean olive-haired man.\nNot only William but everyone for once turned their attention to the Central Adviser as they heard him confessing his thoughts not so long after.\n\"My lord, I don't want to disrespect Sir Alex, but I think before taking any particular action, we should first verify personally whether Hero-sama has actually gone to the Northern Continent or not.\"\nHearing such advice, many of the council members nodded in agreement as this matter wasn't a standard land dispute case. If things go as they seemed likely to be, then war wouldn't be much impossible to occur.\nBut Alex doesn't share the same sentiments as the Wise Duke.\n\"My lord, we all know Kyouki-kun's obsession with Saint-sama and coupled with the fact that the person hero took the portal with, was well aware of Saint-sama's whereabouts, given their recent growing relationship, I think this is the most arguable conclusion I can present.\"\nAlex's reasoning was also on point, which various Council people agreed with too.\nNow only two possible routes were drawn.\nOne, whether they follow Reynold's advice and request for an official investigation. This route was slightly problematic as since asking for a search of the hero in the Northern Empire when they hadn't mentioned about Hero's arrival at all, would destroy the trustability between the two nations.\nAnd if, by any chance, Hero really does get found out being captive in Aurora, then a high probability of war would rise.\nNow unlike the first option, the second one, which Alex was representing, doesn't include any trials or errors at all. From what Alex suggested, the war under the name Asset Dominance would flame between the two nations, eventually burning countless lives.\nThe risk was mutual in both scenarios, but the chance of avoiding the bloody battle only seemed possible in the route on which William ultimately walked upon.\n\"Rey, Alex. The job of collecting the proof whether Hero Kyouki-kun is indeed in Aurorean land or not, now depends on your shoulders.\"\nEven Alex wanted to roll his eyes very badly at the stubborn Emperor; he stood straight just like Reynold and, with a slight bow, announced in unison.\n\"\"We won't disappoint you, my lord.\"\"\n__________________________\nAt the same time, when the particular confidential meeting was taking place in the nation thousands of miles away, a couple was having their sweet time inside a moderately decorated carriage.\nThe snowy lands were getting flat at a furious pace as the two giant wolves pulled the carriage in which three people were currently present.\n\"It indeed is delicious, Anna-san. I hope you can teach me some time too.\"\nAustin complimented the maid, who was serving another cup of tea to her mistress, as she smiled sweetly at the blond youth.\n\"Thank you for the honor, Sir Austin.\"\nAustin wanted to correct Anna again about him not being a noble but remembering how awkward things went when Anna found out who Austin actually was, he held himself back.\nAnna, after serving the tea, went to a corner where she would not disturb the couple before she fell into dead silence.\n\"Don't mind her, Austin. She is guilty of how she treated you in prison.\"\n\"Well, she didn't say anything to me, and it was natural of her to be wary of me.\"\nAustin tried to make things easier for Anna if she was listening but looking at her unmoving figure; he just sighed in defeat.\nOn the other hand, Luna seemed stressed about something else at the moment, as she eventually voiced her concern.\n\"Austin, I don't want to doubt your judgment, but that bespectacled bastard is trustworthy enough?\"\nSuddenly Luna pulled Austin out of his stupor as she asked something which was disturbing her mind since the time she heard Austin's plot for the upcoming events.\n\"Well, I don't trust him to the point where my life would become dependent on him in any scenario, but yeah, I think until I am helping him with his whims, he would not betray me.\"\nFrom what Austin has perceived, Alex wasn't loyal to the hero nor to the place he was born. What he worships were knowledge and discoveries in which Austin was confident to be a help.\nLuna fell into contemplation upon hearing Austin's remark when she suddenly felt a warm sensation enveloping her left hand before she lifted her eyes and met with the gentle gaze of her beloved.\n\"Don't worry, Luna. Whatever happens and whoever betrays me, I will never leave your side and will do my best to nurture this relationship, until the very end. After all, you are the only one whom I can't ever afford to lose.\"\nA loud thump resonated in Luna's senses as she stared dazedly at the two turquoise orbs of the gentlest and most caring person she had ever encountered.\nThe way he calmed her racing heart and gave a sense of relief with just a mere touch was a mystery in itself, but there was something she was sure about....\nThis man was the only person she could ever allow herself to love.\nReciprocating his gentle touch, she closed her eyes in ecstasy before she replied.\n\"Mmm. I know. \"\n______________________\nA/N:- That felt oddly long. I would write a side story about Anna's reaction to Austin's revelation.\nEditor : Zenon #4120",

      "content": "\"Are we done with all the preparation and final check-outs?\"\nSitting in a very thinly lighted room, asked a burly man as he sharpened the wedge of his double-headed ax.\nThe ax, despite being plunged into a raw plain wood, had spilled the blood of countless enemies, which the man holding it had slaughtered to preserve his freedom until now.\n\"I briefed the Generals, double-checked the weaponry, and stretched out our movements among the troops as much as I could. Hopefully, we would be untied for the long term and could inflict damage on the enemy base strongly, this time.\"\nThe person who was working as an assistant and was the most trusted follower of the Rebellion Chief spoke in a confident tone about the battle preparation.\nThe reason why he mentioned, 'Untied for the long term', was because of the unmannerly and lack of training of the troops who didn't have acquired much knowledge about battle formation and team assistance.\nThe lean man, along with the white beard, fell into deep silence as they had the same kind of worries, but soon their train of thoughts was interrupted by a loud thud on the door.\nThe wooden door was almost about to break from its bracket, signifying how hurried the intruder was.\nBoth men inside the room instantly pulled their guards up but when their gaze fell on the sudden appearances, they became shocked, more than wary.\n\"Mike, what's the matter?\"\nThe lean man walked forward and asked the guarding officer in charge of looking out of the main base.\nMike, despite being a guard, held great strength to the level where he could handle one or two Unique Class Demons all by himself, but looking at his current condition, the chief didn't have a good premonition.\nThe head watch guard raised his hand towards the place from where he came from while still huffing audibly, as some particularly unbelievable words left his mouth in between the gasps.\n\"Two peeps*huff* walked just *puff* inside the barrier*huff*.\"\nThe Rebellion Chief, Nordeik's eyes went wide when he heard the words of his trusted guard before he instantly went outside, followed by his assistant.\nTrespassing a barrier that was conjured with the mana of more than 300 mages, and was boosted with the help of Unique Artifacts, was something Nordeik could only expect from the central Empire or any equivalent powerhouse.\nThe conclusion of whether indeed the Aurorean Palace had found their hideout or not was destroyed in a second as soon Nordeik walked out of his cabin.\nThe world was dyed in white as always, with death-freezing whips of cold blizzards making the scene even just some meters from a person, blurry.\nEven though the time was nearing the downfall, and even if the weather was highly non-supportive, Nordeik could perceive that two people were walking right towards where he was.\nHe could hear the screams of soldiers who were doing their best to stop the duo but to no avail. Neither any spell nor any physical attack was working on the team; heck, the attack wasn't even reaching them.\n'Is it a mana barrier?'\nThis was the most generic conclusion the burly chief could land upon, but even so, a barrier able to withstand so many damages was far from his expectancy.\nIt was close to impossible!\n\"Let me handle this, sir.\"\nThe assistant, an excellent mage in Nordeik's arsenal, let go of his shroud as soon his aura started to change with golden lightning erupting at a short range.\nThe man, even being smaller than most of the people in the tavern, was still a Saint Class Mage who had joined the faction since the very first day along with Nordeik and was determined to pluck away any obstruction which would come in before their goal.\nBut the Faction Chief had different plans.\nPlacing a hand over the shoulder of his assistant, Nordeik brought his ax forward with his other hand.\n\"We don't know what kind of monster they are, Bell. It would be better if you stay here as in any unforeseen cases, your life would be much more important than mine.\"\nBell's eyes went wide as he heard the honorable words of his leader, but before Bell could have rebutted his statement, Nordeik plunged into the sky with his ax held tightly in his clutch.\nThe figure of a more than 2 meters big man holding a giant ax and descending from a hazy sky was nothing less than utterly frightening.\nNordeik, even not being proficient in using mana, was still a superhuman who could go hand to hand with a Terror Rank Demon with the uncertainty of results. His strength was enough to give Charles a decent brawl which also helped him build this faction with his trusted assistant, up until now.\nAnd now, when he was a step away from the possibility of raising his flag on the Northern Empire, these two intruders would be the last thing Nordeik would allow.\nUsing his enhanced physicality, Nordeik, after reaching up to a decent height, plunged like an unstoppable meteor towards the intruders, but little did he expect that someone could have sensed him from this range too.\nOne of the intruders suddenly disappeared from the barrier and before Nordeik could have changed his trajectory or thought of any better method, his darting figure collided with an utterly great force.\n**BOOOOOOOOOM**\nA heaven-defying loud explosion resonated in the middle of the sky as the two slammed into each other.\nNordeik's eyes went wide, as along the pulverizing sensation, he saw the blade of his ax creaking up to the base.\nNordeik's whole attention was diverted between his ax and the person who, in an instant, made him realize the gap in their power level before his big body slammed into the ground.\n**DOOOOM**\nThe place where Nordeik fell flat was turned into a small crater with the man as its center.\nInstantly the chestnut-haired mage, Bell, landed right in front of his chief with wide eyes as he also saw the single exchange between the two, and how plainly Nordeik was defeated.\n\"Sir, are you okay?!\"\nWith his hand raised to help his leader, Bell asked panickedly, but instead of getting up, Nordeik just whispered audibly to warn the mage and take the immediate step.\n\"B-Bell...go and...hear...what they ha-*cough* have to say. Whatever hap..pens, just don't get involved in a battle with those...two...\"\n_______________________\n[Bell's POV:]\n'What is he thinking...'\nNot sure what my lord thought, but inviting two intruders inside the base was nothing but an impulsive and careless decision.\nWe were mere six hours away from our full frontal war with the Empire, and now he had invited two people in whom one was, without doubt, belonged to the royal family and the other one by appearance, looked like a foreigner.\nEven though they were doing nothing, except for the flirting and the sweet atmosphere they were creating disgustingly all around the place, I just could not turn my guard off against them at all.\n(A/N:- Guess what they have been doing ;) )\nThankfully the man I wanted to question so dearly right now, entered inside the cabin, which was a little far from the place where the two intruders were seated.\n\"Chief.\"\nI instantly held him at the entrance before he could move inside as I asked him in a slight panic.\n\"There's one of them confirmly from the Royal Palace. Are you sure this decision of letting them in was correct?\"\nI seldom doubt my chief's decision, but this was his most thoughtless one of them all.\nOn my remark, the Chief smiled only to increase my annoyance as I heard his reasoning.\n\"Those two would have infiltrated even if I hadn't permitted you.\"\nRaising my brows, I couldn't keep my curiosity away as I hurriedly asked.\n\"How are you so sure about it? Maybe we could have won if we had fought together.\"\nHearing my argument, the Chief laughed lightly as he placed his hand on his back as he continued.\n\"You already have seen what level of mana that girl carries, that even using such a high barrier spell, she is sitting right here comfortably. Now, if it's about the blonde haired one then see this...\"\nSaying so, he brought his battle ax forward, which he used to attack the two intruders. Since I was in thorough distress then, when I saw him at the crashing point, my eyes never fell on his ax.\nBut looking at it now...\n\"D-does that fragile-looking guy give such damage?\"\nUpon getting a nod, I again inspected the axe I had seen by Chief's side, even before I joined.\nHis ax was made with a metal that was far more expensive and rare than the overcoat which the Northern Emperor wears, but looking at the big chunk of metal disheveled near the wedge and several cracks lining up to the base, for a second, I wondered whether this ax was really reliable?\nI know doubting the quality of the ax was futile as I myself have seen its might being utilized by the chief before, but the problem was how such a mighty weapon broke into such a state just with a mere single blow.\n\"Did he use any artifact or Mythic Grade weapon to inflict such damage?\"\nThis was the only conclusion I could draw upon seeing the miserable conclusion of such a minor confrontation, but the actuality was more terrifying than I could have ever thought.\n\"No, he didn't. That guy used his bare fist to break my Fenrir and the most shocking factor...\"\nHearing that it was not all things to numb my reasoning, I heard something which might make me doubt my life experience until now.\n\"That boy...didn't even use a single ounce of mana, and just with his physical might made me realize that there is someone always stronger than you. He is a monster Bell, with whom we couldn't confront but only can converse for our own good.\"\n______________________\nA/N:- Told ya, he won't hold himself back.\nDrop a comment~\nEditor : Zenon #4120",

      "content": "In a big yet unfurnished room, sat a couple of figures varying in age.\nThe wooden cabin, which could hardly repress the harsh weather conditions outside, currently contained four people in total.\nAmong these four people, two were those who belonged to the rebellious group of the Northern Continent.\nThe term 'Rebellion' was delegated to them due to the reason of the opposition, the blood relative of Emperor Norsvolk, the second Prince Nordeik Eldritch, raised his voice against the way things were moving.\nThe Northern Empire shamelessly neglected the right of those who failed to awaken the mana. Also, the central authority didn't provide many opportunities to let common natives grow.\nBeing not well proficient with mana, Nordeik was able to understand how it feels to face partiality and live while always being compared to someone which you couldn't become even if you exhaust your whole life behind it.\nHe grew with those feelings and never complained but there times came when the most sacrificing personality would also flare back if cornered more than what they could tolerate.\nThe day Nordeik left the royal palace, he vowed to his life that the day he would return, he would change this whole system that the Northern Empire had adopted and would embark on a journey where no one would be treated indifferently ever again.\nAnd now, when everything was going relatively fine, and the Rebellions were about to take their revenge from the capital, a young boy suddenly pops up and declares that they would lose...\n\"Watch your mouth, young man. You might be strong, but it doesn't mean you can insult the strength and courage of our soldiers too!\"\nGrowled under his breath was the Faction chief's assistant, Bell, who, upon hearing the plain declaration of blond youth, that this war of succession would end up in a complete failure.\nNordeik was also slightly annoyed by the declaration from the man which his long-lost niece brought with her. But more than agitated, he was contemplating on the matter.\nFrom what Nordeik could see, his niece was far more potent than what he heard from the rumors, and if counted from typical speculation, Luna indeed was an excellent mage.\nAs for the man who named himself as 'just' Austin, then Nordeik, in actuality, wasn't even sure what to say about the young man.\nOn one side, he used such brute strength to pulverize his war ax [Fenrir] to a state where Nordeik could only grieve about it.\nHowever, on closer inspection, Nordeik could feel a vast amount of mana from Austin too, which he was doing his best to suppress. But the experience Nordeik has accumulated told him right away that Austin himself was a complete warehouse whom Nordeik would not like to meet on the battlefield.\nNordeik wasn't a coward, but he wasn't an idiot either. He knows when to provoke someone and when to keep his horses in control.\n\"You ...whatever your name is. Release your intent again on him, and I will make you realize how one can beg even for death too.\"\nIn a cold tone was the oceanic-eyed only female inside the cabin said as she sensed the heavy murderous intent proceeding towards Austin.\nEven after hearing her, Bell didn't pull his intent and instead focused his gaze on Luna.\nBut fortunately, before any event could have occurred, a big hand dropped on Bell's shoulder as the latter mentioned instantly pulled his killing intent as he realized his chief's wish.\n\"Now-now, Luna. It would help if you also calm down. Bell-san just said what anyone would feel when someone out of nowhere intrudes on their place and tells them that the war is concluded even before commencing. So stop being so angry, okay?\"\nLuna grumbled under the sweet persuasion of her beloved as she retracted her cold gaze and, with a pout side glanced at Austin in complaint.\nAustin was about to say something so he could soothe the cute Saintess somehow, when a loud yet gentle tone reached up to them from their front.\n\"I never thought that Luna, who even in her toddler age only let her mother be around her, would fall in love so badly that even some little flowery words would influence her mood to this extent. I am surprised and happy for you, Luna.\"\nLuna, as well as Austin, stared at the man who was giving a very satisfactory smile, currently making the cold princess shy away a little.\nBut the other party had a more joyous expression on his face as he stared at the bearded man with sparkles filled in his eyes.\nLuna also noticed such a thing which didn't give her a good premonition, and Austin's following words made her worries come true.\n\"You have seen Luna as a baby too?\"\nAustin asked with anticipation filling his voice, and fortunately, the frontman was much more helpful than Austin had evaluated before.\n\"Yes, I had seen Luna from the time when she was in her diapers, and you know one peculiar thing, when she -\"\n\"Ah! Nooooo...Uncle, please don't tell Austin anything about those times; it's embarrassing to death. And Austin, you also don't ask, please. I won't be able to show my face to you ever again.\"\nCried in the plea was the cold and aloof Saintess whose personality was so famous for being indifferent every time that the current Luna would probably have falsified every single rumor about her.\n\"Don't worry, Luna; I won't do such a thing which doesn't make you feel comfortable.\"\nAustin said in a gentle tone to assure Luna, but his devil side made his left eye wink toward the burly man, which the receiver also understood the meaning of, as he blinked in response too.\n\"Guys, can we move to the main topic? It will be dawn in few hours.\"\nThis time it was the troubled assistant who pleaded from the sidelines as he saw the carefree conversation happening when there was a war going to occur in mere 4 hours.\nHearing Bell's voice, the other three returned to their senses as Nordeik nodded and returned to the previous subject.\n\"So Austin, from your perception, this war would conclude negatively for our end, right? Is there any specific reason to support your statement?\"\nNordeik, with a slight profound expression, asked the youth since, without any decent reason, he wouldn't just believe Austin because he was here with his niece nor because Austin was strong.\nBut Austin's following statement made every doubt of Nordeik, as well as Bell's, vanish in an instant.\n\"Hmm...I don't know whether you will believe me, but there is a weapon in Emperor Norsvolk's possession called, 'Limit Breaker.' Do you know what strength that single weapon may carry and how it would have influenced the war you were going to fight against them?\"\nUpon hearing Austin's explicit remark, Nordeik and Bell made almost identical expressions of utter disbelief.\n\"A mythical grade.......\"\nA weapon that was forged by legendary blacksmiths and had been bestowed with blessings of Goddess, a mythical weapon was as rare as finding an oasis in the most incredible desert.\nAnd since the Northern Kingdom didn't have many incredible ancestors , the chances of finding a Mythic weapon within the continent boundaries were as small as finding a needle in a mountain of hay.\nYet...\n\"Don't ask me where I found this out, but trust me, the emperor alone has so many resources that he could wipe half of your army all by himself.\"\nEven Austin's words felt a little bitter to digest; both Nordeik and Bell knew what miracle a strong weapon could bring, not to talk about the unbelievably strong emperor himself.\nBoth the home parties fell silent as they thought of the way to handle things, but it was the tavern chief whose voice rose first.\n\"So Austin, tell us what would be the best course of action to partake now. Since you are fully aware of our situation, do you have any advice you would like to give which could benefit both of us?\"\nBell was still reluctant to trust someone this soon, but the Faction chief wanted to follow his instincts and see how things went.\nNever had he imagined that this simple decision of his, would save the life of countless and his own life too...\n\"Since it's like that, please listen to what I have to say. If things go as I have planned, then within two weeks, I will be seeing Sir Nordeik acquire the throne, which he always belonged to.\"\n____________________\nA/n : Drop a comment~\nEditor : Zenon #4120",

      "content": "Inside the extensive courtroom of Gram palace, gathered a decent number of officials along with the second prince Mikhail and the supreme entity, Emperor William.\nThe meeting was called for the most concerning matter at hand, the disappearance of Humanity's greatest hope, Hero Kyouki.\nThe news of the Hero vanishing from the school abruptly has been widespread, but it wasn't known to the public that the hero used the portal to switch between nations.\nWell, the speculation and rumors have been flaring that Kyouki and Austin went to pursue Luna, who previously went to her hometown; still, certainty wasn't backed to any of the rumors as no one was aware of Luna's background.\nIt goes without saying that the central authority would do their best to suppress those chattering and, in any scenario, wouldn't let general people know about such a terrifying occurrence that took place three days ago now.\nThe meeting was called upon the request of Alex and Duke Reynolds, who their Majesty gave the responsibility to collect evidence on whether the Aurorean nation was indeed hiding the hero or their doubts were just baseless.\nIt was sure that if the Northern Empire were found guilty of hiding the fact about Hero's arrival in the Northern Empire, then by hook or crook, Emperor William would do his all to take what belonged to Gram.\nAnd what Alex was currently presenting, it looks like the chances of war starting seem probable.\n\"As you can see, My lord. I used the artifact I have created for spying to infiltrate the Northern palace, and here's what I found.\"\nCurrently, in the middle of the courtroom, a giant purple globe-sized screen was projected, which worked as a surveillance monitor for the device Alex made to find Kyouki in the Aurorean palace.\nThe device had stealth ability and if about size then; it was similar to a small butterfly that, even being seen, wouldn't make people suspicious.\nCurrently, the giant globe was displaying events which the device was recording. A clear image of a massive sword with a sun emblem crafted near the hilt and a red ribbon tied at the tip of the handle was on display.\nMostly everyone in the courtroom has seen the Hero's Legendary sword, and how it looks like.\nAnd after seeing the sword on the purple globe, the expression of the officials turned ugly as they concluded that, indeed, Hero was being held in Aurora; as Alex said, this sword was stored in the prison storage room.\n\"Since nobody here knows Hero-kun's sword better than Sicily-san, I would like her to verify whether this sword belongs to Hero-kun or not.\"\nUpon hearing her name, Sicily became flustered as she got up on the spur of the moment.\nUnder the heavy gazes of everyone around, Sicily stared at the screen for quite some time while trying her best to remain calm, before she nodded stiffly.\n\"Yes, this sword belongs to Kyouki-kun. The red ribbon and the deep scratch near the base are the same I have seen countless times. \"\nHer voice reverberated clearly in the hall, further making the atmosphere heavier than it already was.\n\"Father, we have to move quickly, or else I don't want to think what experimentation that Norsvolk would perform on Hero.\"\nSpoken in a whisper was the second prince as beneath his main focus, which seemed to be on the hero, Mikhail was primarily stressed about Austin's whereabouts.\nThe frown on William's face couldn't be grim more as he massaged his temples while thinking of the possibilities that could have led to such a situation.\nBut whatever he thought, the end results were the same.\nThe Hero was captivated in a foreign land, and the Authorities of that place have not found it necessary enough to inform them at all.\nThere was nothing to ponder about anymore.\nFocusing his gaze upon the Foreign Minister, William commanded in a deep voice.\n\"Send an official statement that if the Northern Empire doesn't release Hero Kyouki-kun within 24 hours, they can prepare themselves for an all-out war.\"\n\"It's as you say, Your Majesty.\"\nThe official bowed in response before the courtroom again fell in silence.\nWar never gives a good vibe to any nation regardless of their strength and manpower, but the situation was leading in a way that the massacre and slaughtering would rage again on the battlefield.\n'I hope you still have some sanity left in you, Norsvolk.'\n________________________\n\"Hey, Austin. Isn't the hero strangely silent on this whole matter?\"\nIn a warmly lighted room, two figures could be seen, currently resting on a cozy bed, intimately.\nAustin, after returning from the hideout of Rebellious Faction, checked on the hero once and found out that Kyouki was still unmoving from his position.\nHe hasn't spoken at all since the time he was imprisoned nor tried to use his name to create any fuss.\nLuna wasn't bothered about his situation at all; rather, she was worried about what if Kyouki was planning something which might hinder the upcoming events.\nAustin lying on Luna's soft thighs while enjoying her delicate fingers over his hair, replied with his still closed eyes.\n\"Are you worried about him?\"\nThere wasn't any particular emotion hidden in his voice, nor did his expression show any kind of fluctuations when he said that, but  Luna immediately identified the emotion that Austin did his best to suppress.\nWith an evil grin, she whispered coquettishly.\n\"Will my Austin be jealous, if I say yes~\"?\nAustin frowned slightly as he covered his eyes with his arm without intending to answer.\nThe troubled Austin looked so adorable to Luna that the urge to tease Austin rose inside her mind, but before she could have said anything, two great knocks on the door brought the love birds out of their stupor.\n\"Young lady, can I come in?\"\nUndoubtedly it was the personal maid of Luna who was standing on the other side of the door.\nIn normal circumstances, Anna would have come inside the room after just knocking but knowing full well that Anna might see something unforgettable if she was to enter abruptly, the maid leaned on the safe route.\n\"Come in, Anna.\"\nLuna commanded as she saw Austin getting up from her lap. She didn't want him to be so formal around Anna but knowing how he prefers to keep his private life with Luna separated from others; she could only sigh in defeat and let go of him.\n\"Sorry for disturbing you at times like this, but something came up which I thought was important to inform.\"\nInstantly, Austin's dazed look changed profoundly as he focused his eyes on the maid with his brows slightly frowned.\n\"What happened, Anna-san?\"\n\"An official letter from Gram has just arrived, and His Majesty has instantly called for an emergency meeting. I think it's going the same as what Master Austin predicted.\"\n_________________________\nA/N:- Their Lovey-Dovey scenes would be fleshed out more once this arc concludes, and also some school stuff would also take place where Austin would show who's the new boss of Eden Academy.\nAnyway, Drop a comment.\nEditor : Zenon #4120",

      "content": "In a bright natural lighted hall of more than 200 meters in length, there could be seen several figures with quite a profound expression adorning their faces.\nThe courtroom, just like the outside world, was low on degrees as the man sitting on the throne let out a dangerous aura that was enough to make people shiver in fear.\nThe reason for the Northern Emperor's current mood was undoubtedly the letter that arrived some hours ago from the nation of Gram.\nThe mana mail had an official stamp and signature of the Highest Entity of Gram, Emperor Williams, which made the matter entirely the most important thing to pay attention first.\nThe content of the sudden mana mail wasn't something Norsvolk was able to believe; even the spokesperson of the courtroom read it three times loud and clear.\nIn the end, Norsvolk himself read the letter and found that, indeed, what the spokesperson announced was all true, but that didn't help to calm his anxiety at all.\nThe letter which arrived was far from formal greetings or an invitation to any ceremony; it was a plain and straight warning about something which Norsvolk had zero ideas about.\nNaturally, the first thing he did was to order a thorough investigation of his palace as well the places around the empire to see whether the Hero had been hiding here.\nBut despite that, he found nothing related to Hero nor received any teleportation record of anyone from Gram.\nIt took him half a day to inspect the vicinity and do his all to find even a clue about the hero, but nothing came to light, leaving Norsvolk to rely on the last resort.\n\"Where is Hero-sama? I don't want to hear that you are unaware of his arrival.\"\nGrowling dangerously under his breath was the charismatic Emperor of Aurora, who currently looked like an annoyed beast who might engulf anyone if he didn't get his desired answer.\nThe person on whom he nearly shouted on the one in front of the whole court was his own blood-related daughter, Luna.\nThere was only one thing that could bring Hero Kyouki to Northern land if he had indeed come as the Gram was claiming, and that was his relationship with Luna.\nLuna was the last hope of the Northern Supreme and those who were sitting with grim expressions on their face inside the courtroom.\nIf the hero really were in here, then the Aurorean government would, without hesitation, hand him over to Gram despite knowing that after this, the relationship between the two nations would be bittered entirely. But still, it would be better than the possible bloody bath on the battleground.\nBut things seldom go how one expects them to be...\n\"Hero Kyouki-kun? I haven't seen him in a while. Why are you asking about him all of a sudden, father~.\"\nStated without a care in the world, even though she was receiving the coldest glare of the century right at the moment, was the amused Princess who was enjoying her father's expression to her heart's content.\n\"You! Don't dare to play with me! The lives of countless are on line, and you are daring to say such a lie! Have some shame, Luna, and save your mother some face before nothing could be left to save.\"\n**SWISSH**\n\"Khwak!!\"\nSuddenly after shouting his authoritative plea, Norsvolk felt a heavy amount of mana choking on his life as he saw the person he just yelled upon, in her most dangerous intent, glaring at him.\n\"Princess! Retract your attack, or I won't hesitate to suppress you!\"\nThe one who came forward was a royal guard who was responsible for the Emperor's safety. Upon seeing Norsvolk struggling to breathe, the stress in the courtroom increased to another level as the Knight pointed his weapon at Luna.\nDespite being at the tip of a Unique Grade weapon that was being held by a Veteran of the battleground, Luna's eyes were still fixed upon the man whose face was turning blue and red now.\nThe royal knight only waited for two seconds before he used his wooden staff to launch an attack on Luna, only to regret it in the end.\nLuna, without turning her gaze away, just lifted her index finger right at the point where the butt of the staff was about to touch her before the staff, along with the knight, froze in an instant.\n**CREAAAK**\nThe whole room gasped in horror as they witnessed the clear display of a chantless spell cast that took less than a wink to turn an alive and healthy man into a frozen statue.\nIt was a sight, terrifying beyond belief!\n\"Listen to me, Emperor Norsvolk! If you ever dare to put my mother's name to corner me, then I will eradicate every single thing which you consider precious right in front of your eyes before I slowly end your life! So beware of what you say.\"\nSaying so, she released her pressure which slowly had crept upon the whole hall, as Norsvolk finally regained his breathing as he panted like a dog while crouching on the floor.\nLuna, on the other side, was far from bothered about him or anyone inside the courtroom as she made her way toward the place where her most significant interest awaited her.\n_______________________\n\"Hmm? You are earl-wait, what happened, Luna?\"\nAustin, who was about to turn around to greet Luna, who went to hear the inquiry about Kyouki, was suddenly hugged from behind.\nIt didn't take long for Austin to realize that something had happened in the courtroom, which covered Luna with such dark clouds. Since Luna wanted to face her father without Austin's help, he didn't go with her using the cloak and instead stayed in her room.\nBut looking at her now, he thought it would have been better if he had stayed by her side.\n\"Did they say something which made you sad?\"\nSensing her head going up and down on his back Austin concluded that he hit the mark as he held her hand which was around his torso before he continued.\n\"Are you hurt?\"\nThis time Luna hesitated for a bit but, in the end, nodded slowly.\nWith his hand going a little stiff on his hold, Austin's voice took a heavier turn as he asked in a deep tone.\n\"Should I destroy this emperor and acquire this nation by force rather than politics?\"\nSince Luna's height was about three inches shorter than Austin's, she was able to see his expression over his shoulder, and when she did, she became dead frozen in fret for a second.\n\"Austin...\"\nLuna gently whispered in his ear to bring Austin out of his dangerous stupor, which made Luna immensely worried as well as delighted to know that her love had become angry in her stead.\n\"I am okay and don't say such a thing. Remember, our primary goal is to help you score Villain's point, which might not result in the same if we were to use a forceful method to reach our goal. I am happy that you got mad for me, but we have to act calmly.\"\nAustin felt slightly embarrassed that when he should have been consoling Luna, he was getting pampered instead.\nHe turned around and slowly held his favorite person fondly in his embrace.\n\"I know, Luna. But after I have fallen for you, everything involving you influences me too. I don't remember when I became so weak in controlling my emotions, but after meeting you, I have changed.\"\nLuna, with her eyes closed, while feeling her favorite warmth, heard his gentle whisper before she also replied in the same pitch as she clutched the hem of his shirt in anticipation.\n\"Is that a bad thing?\"\n\"No, of course not. I indeed am changing, but it's for a good cause. If before meeting you, I was a broken mess, then after meeting you, I feel like a complete man. If before meeting you, I was like useless trash, who could have tolerated the beating of any second person, then now I won't take crap from anyone, in order to look good in the eyes of the girl I love.\"\nHalting for a moment, he separated himself from Luna as he held her chin with his finger and made her hazy eyes land on his, as he concluded.\n\"You are my pride, Luna. My arrogance. The cause of my grief and the reason for my happiness. If someone bad mouths you, I feel agitated, and if someone praises you, I also feel elated. These are my honest thoughts about you, Luna, and I am happy to have such a way of thinking, as apart from you, I don't have anyone I can or want to have such feelings for. So let me embrace these feelings and cling onto this new reality of mine.\"\nLuna, who heard every word with a dazed expression, felt her heart tingling with a warm sensation as she felt how much his words had a dangerous effect on her.\nStaring at his jade green eyes and feeling his slight warm breath reaching her face, Luna seemed to become more and more captivated by this unfairly perfect man.\n\"Austin.\"\nBeing called with such a small soft whisper, Austin raised his brows as he hummed in question before he was caught in complete off-guard.\n\"I love you.\"\nTiptoeing quickly after confessing her love for the first time, Luna planted her warm and soft lips on Austin's just for a blink before she got out of his embrace and went away in a fluster.\nOn the other side, the receiver of such an unexpected powerful blow was currently standing with his hand still raised in a way he was hugging someone, as with his big eyes he blinked quite some time while trying to understand what just happened some seconds ago.\nRaising his hand slowly up to his lips, where lingered the sensation of what happened only for a blink, Austin concluded that it wasn't his hallucination at all, which also helped him to finally get out of his stupor as he muttered under his breath...\n'Did...she ...just...accepted my confession...?'\n_______________________\nA/N :-Drop a comment~\nEditor : Zenon #4120",

      "content": "There are two kinds of war that occur under different circumstances.\nFirst, Total Dominance.\nThis war is partaken to take the complete authority of a specific kingdom by going for an all-out war. This kind of war generally makes either country dry up with their resources and manpower as the war only follows the principle of do-or-die.\nThe war of complete dominance majorly happens within a continent which is not adequately organized or has such a policy that supports brutality.\nThe war of acquiring a whole empire never happened in the past, as an Empire meant an entire piece of land among the seven, which was nothing to scoff about casually.\nTo acquire a whole empire, a colossal level of war has to be undertaken with countless lives and millions of small battles exhausting in the process and sacrificing unimaginably.\nThe second type of war is for Asset Dominance.\nThis war happens on a smaller scale where a battle happens to acquire something forcibly or snatch back something which initially belonged to them.\nThese kinds of wars have happened before between Kingdoms, and the end results weren't something that could be written in history books, given the inhumanity those emperors stepped on to acquire something so small that the war seemed nothing but foolishness to partake in.\nBut for what Gram was about to wage war was nothing less than their whole treasury and other impactful assets.\nThe Hero of Humanity, who was destined to become the light of Hope and would extinguish the possible threat of the Monarch of Darkness in the future, who forcefully or not was currently captured in a foreign continent.\nThere was nothing left to ponder about. Since the Aurorean nation hasn't replied to anything at all in the last 20 hours, the central council has already announced the preparation of war which would be taking place in the upcoming three days.\nCurrently, in a thinly lighted closed room sat two dozen people wearing their armor that included the Emperor of the nation along with his second son Mikhail who was one of the greatest warriors of the country.\nAlong with these two nobles, the Knight Commander Charles and Court Magician Alex were also present inside the room, along with some other high-ranking officials.\n\"The mages from the Tower would take almost two days to teleport the army to the Northern Empire. Alex, keep a close watch on this side for any disturbance.\"\nSince reaching the Northern Empire via physical route would take more than a month, mass teleportation was the best means to reach the destination without wasting many resources on the expedition.\n\"It's as you say, My lord.\"\nAlex bowed his head slightly with a sly smirk on his face as William continued to the following command.\n\"Since the Northern Kingdom doesn't have any allied empire as a backer, we won't be facing any surprises, but even so, Captain Charles, I want you to be on the watch all the time. Please don't get engrossed in the battle more than necessary.\"\nThis time apart from Charles, various nodded, and the one who got directed by such pleas just grumbled and stiffly forced his head to go up and down.\n\"I want this battle to end as soon as possible to show the Northern Empire and the other enemies out there, what it means to go against us. We will snatch what belongs to us and help Hero Kyouki-kun to gain the freedom he deserves.\"\nThe flames of determination ignited among many, present inside the conference hall as they heard the bold and courageous statement of their liege.\nAmidst the wave of determination and sheer resolution to achieve their certain goal, a heavy voice reached up to everyone as the Knight Commander began to speak.\n\"Ahm...has anyone thought about Austin?\"\nThe sudden mention of the name, whom they hadn't paid much heed to since the hero's disappearance was everything they could care about, made many baffled as they looked at Charles with a complicated face.\n\"Austin...what about him?\"\nThe one who spoke with sparkly eyes, even though his voice seemed to be doubtful, was the youngest person in the room, Mikhail.\nHe was the most interested in the topic, and thanks to Charles, he could now bring it up without hesitation.\n\"From what I have seen, Austin isn't a person who can get caught by any of the measles of the North. Either Austin is willingly staying there, or the Northern Empire has something in store which we aren't aware of.\"\nHearing such a thorough evaluation of the matter from the muscle head Charles, many of the council members' mouths parted in astonishment.\nHowever, William had a different reaction to the matter which Charles presented. William, with his eyebrows frowning, fell into deep contemplation as what the Knight Commanded said confirmed that Austin and Kyouki's inactivity seemed too suspicious.\nBoth youngsters were able to send at least some signal to notify the kingdom about their condition. But none of them were showing any sign, where they were or what, in actuality, happened after they jumped through the portal.\nWhat made William more stressed was what would happen if, even after the war, the two assets of the Gram didn't agree to come back. Worst case scenario, what would be their stance, if the two stood against Gram in the war?\nWilliam became highly stressed to even think about such a possibility.\nBut before he could come to any conclusion, someone hurriedly stepped inside the conference hall, attaining the attention of everyone present inside.\n\"My lord! An envoy from the Northern Continent has arrived.\"\nThe atmosphere became heavier as William, followed by others, stood at an instant as they heard the guard about something they weren't expecting at all.\n\"So Norsvolk hasn't gone senile after all.\"\nWilliam's face lighted up slightly as he walked toward the entrance with Mikhail by his side. But before they could have exited the room to greet the envoy, the messenger again spoke up.\n\"Umm...your majesty. The envoy isn't from the Royal Palace.\"\nWilliam, in an instant, halted in his steps, making the messenger shudder in fear.\n\"Then who is it from?\"\nWith his voice reaching up to a certain chillness, William asked the messenger only to get shocked in the end.\n\"I-Its from a different faction from the North, my lord.\"\n______________________\n\"Okay, Kyouki-kun. It's time to change your temporary residence.\"\nEntering inside the cell where Kyouki was sitting by the wall, Austin broke the chain restraining Kyouki's feet before he asked him to get up.\nAustin was ready to face Kyouki if he was to struggle when he was migrating Kyouki to somewhere else. But strangely, Kyouki was listening to every word of Austin like he was just a puppet.\nThe reason how Austin was able to infiltrate the central prison as per he desired was the spell he used in the Eden Academy's Teleportation center.\nTaking the still disfigured Kyouki out of the cell, Austin couldn't help but ask in curiosity.\n\"Why are you letting things go so easily? I mean, is there any motive you aren't resisting anything, even knowing I am using you for some evil purposes.\"\nAustin had little idea why Kyouki was so silent since the time he was captured, and hearing it from the person himself, Austin's doubt cleared in an instant.\n\"If cooperating with your plans would make Luna happy, as you said before, then I am ready to be used for any means.\"\nSighing, Austin didn't speak further, just walked with Kyouki behind him toward the exit.\nOn the way out, a thought emerged in Austin's mind that he found necessary to occur for Kyouki's own good.\n'I think I have to make Kyouki face reality, or this hero would be of no use in the future....'\n_______________\nA/N:- Short chapter since I was out of words. I will skip this war scenario since it feels a little stretchy?\nAnyway, I hope my story hasn't become boring, so please let me know how you feel about it~\nEditor : Zenon #4120",

But what made her freeze was the man who was hugging the princess with his gaze now drawn upon the maid.\n'Wait, isn't he..!!'\nAnna just observed the scene for mere two blinks before she disappeared from her site and, with inaudible steps, appeared just beside the couple, as she moved her hand toward Austin's arm.\nBut before her hand could have grabbed and broken Austin's forearm, Austin grabbed Anna's wrist to the utmost shock of the maid, who was confident in her agility.\n\"Calm down, Anna-san. I am not an intruder.\"\nAustin's calm voice brought Luna also back out of the stupor in which she seemed to be drowned since the time she hugged her favorite person.\n\"Anna?\"\n\"My lady, don't worry. I will even sacrifice myself to save you from this monster.\"\nSaying so, Anna snatched her arm back as Austin also separated himself from Luna since he knew Anna wasn't going to listen anytime soon.\nBut to Austin's surprise, the authoritative tone of Luna, who seemed to become annoyed when she heard her beloved being called a monster, calling out for Anna.\n\"Stop right there, Anna.\"\nUnlike a standard command, Austin was able to see mana waves emitting from Luna's vocal cord as she quickly subdued Anna's movement like a heavy blow had pulverized her.\n\"M-my lady?\"\nAnd not only that, under the heavy gaze of Luna, with her mana continuously being directed at the maid, made the latter mention choked even to speak correctly.\nAustin saw Anna's trouble as he hurriedly placed a hand on Luna's shoulder to wake her up.\n\"Luna, you are hurting her.\"\nLuna, after hearing the familiar gentle voice, seemed to finally notice her nanny's struggle as she instantly pulled back her intent, giving some space for Anna to breathe.\nAustin walked with a glass of water toward the gasping maid after leaving the pouting Luna, who seemed to be slightly guilty yet still angry that her sweet time with Austin was disturbed like this.\nCrouching down in front of the maid, Austin offered the glass as he spoke in a mild tone.\n\"Here, Anna-san. Sorry for the late introduction, but I am the person who is currently dating your young lady.\"\n\"I haven't accepted your confession, tho~ Mister Austin.\"\nSince Luna was still angry with Austin's reckless actions in the arena, she found this a chance to get back at him.\nAustin, after hearing Luna's amused tone, rolled his eyes and corrected his mistake.\n\"Well, you can say I am dating her one-sidedly.\"\nAnna, who received a glass of water from the person she assumed as a mere criminal some hours ago, was shocked beyond belief.\n'Sir Austin...?'\nAnna had heard this name about hundreds of times from Luna, so she became conscious of how this stranger could enter her young lady's room so quickly.\nAnd when she finally seemed to realize the whole situation, her face became bright red, and she hurriedly jumped on her toes before she sat in dogeza and spoke in a fluster.\n\"I sincerely apologize for such unruly and rude behavior I just presented to Austin-sama. I wasn't aware of Austin-sama's identity, that's why...I...I am really sorry. Please forgive me, Austin-sama.\"\nWith her head rubbing on the ground, Anna hurriedly pleaded her apology, making Austin embarrassed as he tried to stop her, but she wasn't listening to anything at all.\nAustin turned his head towards Luna in hopes of help, but when he saw her evil grin, he declared his defeat instantly.\n'This sadist saint...'\nSighing, he concluded he had to do something about this himself as he slowly brought his hand on top of Anna's head before she finally seemed to pause in her movement.\n\"It's okay, Anna-san. You didn't show any rude behavior; instead, I am glad Luna has such a responsible maid near her who could protect her in my absence. So don't apologize for your duty as it shows you are feeling ashamed to serve Luna.\"\nAnna's body jerked as she heard Austin's firm yet gentle tone, which made her realize that, indeed, she behaved like this because she wasn't aware of Austin's identity.\nLifting herself slowly, Anna, with her teary eyes, looked at the gentle gaze that Austin was bestowing upon her as she finally came back to herself.\nAustin was a little taken aback by the peculiar expression of the beautiful older woman, but he held himself quite skillfully.\n\"Austin-sama...\"\n\"Drop that -sama. I am not any noble, and since you are close to Luna, please consider me your little brother, okay?\"\nAustin spoke casually as he knew from what Luna had told him back in Gram, Anna was the only person who has stayed by Luna's side without any personal greed and she was the only person Luna trusted other than her grandmother.\nBut both Anna and Austin forgot about one thing: there was a person in the room who gets super jealous very quickly.\n\"Aren't you guys growing close quite intimately~\"\nAustin and Anna stared at each other in perplexion as they both blinked simultaneously before turning back and finding the source of this sudden chillness.\n\"My lady!?\"\n\"Luna...wait!\"\n____________________\nA/N:- This was the shortest chapter I guess, but side stories can't be stretched out more than necessary can they?\nAnyway, if you are liking the story, then let me know in the comments.~\nAuthor : Zenon #4120",

      "content": "The war ended.\nResults were something that anyone could have guessed and expected.\nThe Northern Empire lost brutally under the lethal dominance of the Knight Commander, who solely ended the life of half of the army belonging to Aurora.\nIronically, Gram didn't lose even more than two hundred of their soldiers because of the excellent support their mages provided them.\nWith the most prominent figures on the battlefield in the form of Knight Commander and competent Court Magician, Gram ultimately ruled the battlefield and concluded it at the end of the sixth day.\nSince the war wasn't focused on acquiring the Northern Empire, the Emperors didn't interfere in the battle; however, the resources and access to the main palace of Aurora were now accessible to Gram as per the Code.\nA soft wind came and eradicated the peacefulness of Aurora and brought the Gram up to their neck before they could have even appropriately countered.\nThe battle, even brief, was impactful enough to leave an indelible scar that the upcoming generation would remember as this day embarked on the commencement of a new era.\n\"And so, now Majesty William would help you gain control over Aurora because you are helping him with the hero. Hmm...nice as I expected.\"\nSpoke in a calm tone while being surrounded by some specific figures was the blond youth. He spoke with a smile before he glanced at the screen which appeared in front of his retina.\n[Ding!]\n[Weekly requirements have been fulfilled]\n[Host will be granted the rewards shortly..]\n[Calculating the surplus..]\n[Creating the suitable rewards....]\n[Ding!]\n[You have received:-\n1. Shape Shifter X1\n2. Refining Pill X3]\n\"It's as you planned, boy. Gram's council is blind for the hero. They accepted my offer even though they were aware that I belonged to the same blood as the person, who, as they thought, abducted their hero. Well, their foolishness helped us eventually, so who's complaining.\"\nThe one who joyously announced was the chief of the Rebellious faction as what seemed impossible to achieve some days ago was now dancing over their palm.\nAustin was the one who asked Nordeik to visit the Gold Palace and propose an offer they couldn't refuse.\nThe safety of Hero in exchange for the throne was a high price of the trade, but when Nordeik falsified information about Kyouki and told William the possible way Norsvolk uses to keep his prisoners hidden from normal speculation, William agreed instantly with Nordeik's proposal.\nRisks were high, but Nordeik negotiation and some of the officials from Gram helped pursue the Emperor quite conveniently.\nCurrently, inside the room, Nordeik, along with Bell, were sitting with Austin and Luna as they celebrated their possible victory, which seemed just far from their reach.\nAfter the celebration, Luna and Austin returned back to the palace using the portal, which Luna was able to conjure after she got complete familiarity with the Rebellion Faction's hideout.\nJust like the past nights, they both changed into comfortable clothing before lying on the same cozy bed intimately.\nLuna was currently wearing a one-piece night dress which had a deep cut around her neck, exposing a healthy amount of cleavage with her lower region only covered up to her upper thighs.\nHer appearance was mostly revealing during the night, which Austin had grown accustomed to somehow, but still, it didn't mean he could hide his excitement when such an otherworldly beauty was lying on cuddling with him so defenselessly.\nHer body warmth and natural fragrance were so enthralling that Austin found it quite hard to keep himself in control. He was, after all, a teenage boy mentally. Even though he has lived twice the worth of his age, he just couldn't brush away such temptation like a saint.\nHeck, even eternal saints would find it hard when such a sinful body is right in exposure!\nUnaware of the whirlwind of thought of her man, Luna raised her head and after supporting her chin on Austin's chest, she asked him in perplexion.\n\"Austin, I am happy you are gaining control over the North but can I ask why you suddenly thought of acquiring nations? I mean, I know it's for your Villain points but Empire dominance really came out of nowhere. \"\nLuna's curiosity was justifiable since what she wrote in her letter and Austin's resolve to conquer her birth land was far from aligning. She was elated to see Austin's increasing hold on the nations, but still, it made her slightly worried too.\n\"Well, you can say I have a hunch for which I plan to have a strong influence on all the seven continents.\"\nLuna blinked twice as she tilted her head in astonishment, making some strands of hair fall over her eye.\nAustin brought his hand and tucked her hair gently before he replied to the curious child.\n\"Things are happening in a way I am not expecting. Demons are appearing more often, and they are more capable than I had anticipated. If things go as I fear them to be, then the resurrection would happen before the expected time. So this power gain is all to counter what is incoming.\"\nLuna's eyes went slightly wide as she heard about the being, which was the only entity she wasn't sure of defeating with her current power level.\nShe hadn't seen that being, but from the stories she heard and the number of battles that had fallen, she saw the grave; a sense of chill also grew inside her.\nAustin saw through Luna's worries as he gently placed his hand on top of her head, and while patting her gently, he spoke in a calm and soothing tone.\n\"You don't have to worry, Luna. Whatever happens, I will not let anyone or anything destroy this peacefulness that we share. I will not let anyone snatch away my time with you, whatever it takes. So smile brightly and leave everything to me.\"\nLuna saw his confident eyes and felt the warmth from the safety Austin was providing her with. Luna knew she would never leave Austin to face any catastrophe alone, but when he says something so dashingly...\n\"...unfair.\"\n....she just could not face him.\nDraping her cheek on his warm chest, she retracted her gaze as she heard his calm heartbeat in the silence.\nEven the outside world was in chaos, and tens of changes were happening past each second; Luna had just all her attention invested in this man who had stolen her heart without warning.\nSuddenly Luna felt Austin's hand roaming on her back softly, which formed a mischievous grin on her moon-white face as she spoke with a smirk.\n\"Aren't your hands going out of your control, mister Austin~\"\nReceiving the heads up, Austin retracted his hand in a fluster, which genuinely went on her back in the flow of his pats.\n\"I-I am sorry... it's just-\"\nLuna suddenly lifted her back and landed her firm back on Austin's pelvic region as she sat with her eyes looking down upon the embarrassed Austin.\nHer lips curved in an evil grin as she felt a peculiar kind of heat beneath her butt, signifying how turned on Austin was at the moment.\nLooking at his red face mixed with the stiff tension he was feeling from his nether region, Luna intentionally started grinning her ass on Austin, further increasing his stiffness.\n\"L-Luna...please...\"\nAustin extended his hand to stop her, but the sadist saint was far from satisfied as she grabbed his hand before replying in a coquettish tone.\n\"What please, mister Austin~ Do you want to grab me too while I help you release your pent-up desires? Hoh~ I didn't know Mister Austin was such a greedy boy.\"\nSaying so, she moved her waist back and forth in perfect sync as she pressed his hand to her left breast before making her movement more vigorous.\n\"Mm~\"\nA soft moan left her lips, too, as she felt Austin's big and rough hand pressing against her delicate skin, much to her excitement as she heard him groan.\n\"Luna...s-stop I am...reaching there...\"\n\"Reaching where Mister Austin? If you*hah* won't tell me, how *huff* can I understand you?\"\nHer face became flushed red too, as she felt the unfamiliar wetness spreading over her nether region and the stiffness of Austin growing more profoundly than ever before as she moved her waist without a break.\n\"Luna...I ...am...\"\nSuddenly she stopped her movement as she felt him reaching the end, much to his frustration.\nGrinning like a pure devil, she got up from his lap while trying to maintain her own shaky legs before she muttered under her breath.\n\"Too bad~ Mister Austin never clarified what he wants.\"\nShe was about to rush to the bathroom and finish her business, when a warm hand rashly held her wrist before she felt dangerous chills on her back.\nBefore she could have even yelped, she was abruptly pulled back on the bed with a dark expression of her not-so-gentle lover, appearing right above her.\nAustin, with his face still hot and mind filled with unfulfilled desires, growled slightly as he spoke in the heat he had never felt before.\n\"Where do you think you are going? We have a long night ahead of us.\"\nLuna, with slightly wide eyes and steam continuously gasping out of her lips, gulped hard as she saw Austin's expression before she whispered under her breath.\n\"P-please be gentle with me....\n_____________________\nA/N:- And they did it.

Well, you will read anyways, so here you go~\n--------------------------\nThe night was freezing as ever in the Northern Empire, with bone-freezing blizzards echoing from outside the main palace of Aurora. But inside a specific room, a certain warmth be felt if someone even crossed from in front of the door.\nThis heat wasn't from any spell or any artifact. Instead, it was created by the hot breaths of two teenagers who were sharing a very intimate space currently, while gawking at each other without minding the fact that humans have to blink too.\nThe shiny emerald eyes, which were currently filled with lust and desire, intently looked at the person who he pinned down.\nTheir oceanic eyes of Luna were slightly hazy since what she initiated on impulse came back to bite her, but she didn't hate it at all. But this was too sudden for her to handle!\n\"Au-Austin calm down, ne?\"\nLuna tried to calm the beast who had been sleeping inside Austin until now. Whatever provocation she flaunted in front of him some moments ago. Either it was her see-through negligee or her utter vulnerability whenever they cuddled. Luna always tested his patience, but today, she went far beyond his tolerable capacity.\nBringing her other hand slowly toward his stiffness which has been bulging in his pants like forever now, Austin made her touch his thing before he spoke in a little hoarse voice.\n\"Can you feel it, Luna? You have made me like this, and now you ask me to calm down?\"\nLuna's eyes tightly went shut, but she didn't refuse to touch Austin's rock-hard dick. Once again, she gasped at how long it was as she ran her hand up and down and subconsciously started to rub him off from above the pants.\nAustin groaned slightly since her hand felt extremely good, even though there was a layer of cloth in between their skin.\n\"Luna, open your eyes and part your lips.\"\nLuna heard his voice and while still her hand on his stiffness; she slowly lifted her lids which showed her moist eyes urging Austin to ravage her as soon as possible before he saw the girl obediently opening her mouth.\nHer supple lips, which he had kissed before too, seemed extremely erotic right now as, after leaving all courtesy behind, he started devouring his favorite sweet.\nWith his hand sliding behind her back, Austin pulled Luna from the bed since he found the position difficult for kissing his lover.\nSoon their position shifted as, while overlapping his lips over hers, he sat on the ledge of the bed with Luna currently on his thighs. His stiffness came in contact with her belly as it got slightly squeezed in between them.\nWithout knowing, Luna already had locked her legs on Austin's back with her hand hugging his neck like she was a lazy lover, leaving all responsibility to her beloved.\nAustin complied with Luna's request and soon intensified the kiss.\n\"Mm~.\"\nLuna felt the soft tongue entering her mouth, which she accepted but still a little stunned, she didn't offer herself immediately.\nAustin didn't find it a bother to search the small piece of flesh timidly hiding at the back of her mouth before he dug it out and made her surrender under his merciless attacks.\nAustin tilted his head to deepen the kiss as much as possible, with his tongue altogether playing with hers as the room filled with vulgar sounds of their wet lips making love to each other.\nHis big and firm hands, which were roaming on Luna's back, suddenly made their way to her firm and perky butt; he didn't hesitate before he slid both his hands inside her underwear and groped both her cushion in a tight hold.\n\"Ahh!\"\nLuna exclaimed as she felt her butt being deformed by such a rough and warm hand. And not only that, but even though she yelped, Austin still was kneading her butt like he owned them.\nLooking at him with a sharp glare, Luna asked in a fake crisp tone.\n\"Is it me or my butt you love better?\"\nLuna knew that Austin loved her ass since she had felt his eyes on hers various times, and also, she had felt him occasionally touching her there whenever they cuddled.\n\"Of course, I love my Luna. But the love I carry for these two sweet fruits is something different. You don't want me to touch it?\"\nAustin made an innocent dropping lips expression which made Luna's heart skip a beat before she realized he was faking it.\n\"Don't play cute now, master Austin when your hands are moving so perversely~.\"\n\"So, do you hate it?\"\nA blush made way on Luna's face as she got cornered like this when she thought to counter him before.\nWith his gaze fixated on her and her own legs being a cage that prohibited her from running away, Luna lowered her eyes timidly before she whispered in a frail voice.\n\"N-not really...\"\nGrinning, Austin lifted Luna before pinning her down again on the bed, which made her confused about what he actually wanted to do.\nBut soon, she understood his evil plans as she felt a chilling sensation over the tip of her perked left nipple.\n\"Hoh~ They are incredibly stiff, Luna. I wonder your teasing backlashed on yourself too?\"\nApart from the thin nightwear, there wasn't anything covering her upper half, so the tip of Austin's finger brushed quite vividly over her sensitive teat.\n\"Au-Austin...I am sensitive the-hick!\"\nShe was about to warn Austin since she really couldn't hold it when that section of her breast was teased when suddenly she felt a slimy muscle licking her all over.\nGliding her gaze toward her chest, Luna saw Austin devouring her left breast without an ounce of mercy.\nShe instantly closed her eyes and fell back on the bed as she felt his lips sucking her bust with his tongue circulating around her aerolea and sometimes slicking it over her nipple.\nHer hand clutched the bed sheet as she threw all her embarrassment and enjoyed the newfound sensation and hot breaths leaking from her lips.\nHer knees bent as she rubbed her thighs vigorously while trying to get rid of itchiness from her nether region while enjoying the caress she was receiving from her lover.\nThe thought of being touched there while he played with her tits urged inside her mind before she numbly asked Austin.\n\"A-mm Austin...there..touch me there too~.\"\nWith her face completely flushed, she spoke in a whispering tone which Austin caught without problem before he took his mouth away from the juicy melon and responded to her request.\n\"As you desire, lady~\".\nLuna anticipated the warmth she was feeling on her upper body to be touched down her nirvanic cave, too, but Austin wouldn't just get over the destination without teasing her.\nWhile enjoying her innocent expression, Austin glided his hand over her milky white belly before he moved toward her pelvis region.\nWith her chest heaving up and down, Luna kept her eyes closed as slight frustration rose inside her.\n\"Just get over there already!\"\nLuna took his hand and forcibly put it over the spot which was searching for Austin's warmth for so long now.\nAustin grinned ear to ear as he saw her adorable reaction before he obliged with his woman's wants.\nSliding his hand inside the underwear, Austin wasn't interrupted by any pubic hair before he felt the peculiar warmth and wetness damping her frilly underwear.\n\"Mmm~\".\nLuna moaned in delight as she finally felt his rough hand over her sex lips as she felt her breast being played with again.\nAustin didn't rush but first inspected her cooze, while continuously devouring her breast.\nHer labia were thin but still to the point where he got excited even just by touching them. He slipped his middle finger at the center of her pussy before using the other two fingers to entrap his middle finger between her sex lips.\n\"Ah!\"\nA sudden sensation made Luna open her eyes wide as she felt her vagina being entrapped by Austin before he started vibrating his hand vigorously.\n\"Ah, ~ Aha-ha* Austin! Hmmm, ~ Yesh!!\"\nShe couldn't mutter a proper word as she felt jolts coming from her most mysterious place as Austin strummed her flesh and felt the new wetness gushing out of her cunt hole.\nHis mouth wasn't resting either as he sucked hard on her bountiful breast to the point where a ring was formed around her areola.\nSuddenly his thumb felt a stiffness above her labia, before he non-hesitantly pressed it slightly.\n\"Hiiick!! Aus-Austin that...that!\"\nHe knew that it was the button that provides the most euphoric sensation to women, so he didn't wait to give her time, and with his three front fingers, he started targeting the small nub over her overflowing pussy.\n\"I-If you do t-ah~ Ha right there! Ah..ah..ah Ish coming! Ehhhhhh!!!\"\nWith her voice turning shrill, Luna pressed Austin's head on her bust as her neck arched as she felt her orgasm reaching when suddenly all the foreign sensations disappeared from her body.\nWith irritation loaming, she abruptly opened her eyes as she met with an evil smirk forming on the lips of her heartless lover.\n\"Oops! My hand slipped out~.\"\n'This guy!!'\n__________________\nA/N: - Since it felt like I would be rushing to write it in a single chapter, I decided to break it in two.\n.\nP.

      "content": "\"Mm.\"\nFrowning slightly, Luna felt the warmth beside her, distancing. She extended her hand but still couldn't feel the sensation she desired.\nOpening her eyes slowly, she felt relief that the room was primarily dim as it didn't take her to readjust her vision. Turning her eyes to her left, she saw the broad bare back of her beloved.\nLifting her upper self, the soft bed sheet slipped down her naked figure, revealing her sinful body in total exposure.\nHer moon-white skin, which had a lot of reddish marks and playful bites, made her remember the night she spent with her beloved before she fell unconscious.\nA shy smile made her way on her slightly flushed face before she hugged Austin from the back.\n\"Good morning, master~.\"\n\"Oh, you're awake.\"\nWith a soft smile, Austin looked over his shoulder as he clutched the small thing he was inspecting before, inside his fist.\nFeeling Luna's bare body connected to his, Austin felt jolts of excitement running down his spine as the memory of something wild flashed in his mind.\nThanks to Luna's question, he was able to end his stupor before his inner beast could have taken over.\n\"What's that? You don't want me to know?\"\nLuna was clearly signifying toward the stone, which Austin hid instantly upon hearing her voice.\nSighing, he held Luna's hand before he placed the stone at the center of her palm, much to her perplexion.\n\"You know what it is?\"\nAustin asked as he had no idea what was the specification of the tear sculptured runic stone.\nBut in reality, she didn't hear Austin at all, as her current attention was wholly drawn upon the thing Austin landed on her palm.\nHer eyes were slightly wide as she inspected the stone thoroughly about thrice in a row, and to her utter disbelief, all three times, the result came the same.\nTurning her focus to the confused Austin, Luna spoke with her voice filling with excitement.\n\"Austin, you know about the moon goddess, Gracia?\"\nBeing asked something that he read during his crawling age, Austin nodded without much thought as he said something in the flow.\n\"The mother of the three unfortunate children?\"\nHis voice sounded a little dubious, but it wasn't for his lack of knowledge but the context of such a topic with stone.\nBut Luna's following words made him realize why she asked something like that.\n\"Yes, that's correct. The goddess who always lost her precious children every time she resurrected them. There were various unfortunate reasons and sometimes just mere coincidence, but in no life the moon goddess was able to lead her children to ascend to godhood.\"\nAustin nodded with his mind still rumbling in bafflement as he was aware of all these facts, but not what Luna said next.\n\"That is why she created three specific stones which gave her children the opportunity to nurture their life and one day they could break their curses and become the deities whom people could look up to.\"\nAustin's face lighted up slightly upon the new discovery but just that. His expression still told how this was all related to the piece of rune Luna had in her hand.\nSighing, Luna shook her head as she cleared the obvious doubt about her cute dunce Austin.\n\"My dear young master, this stone is one of the tears which dropped when the heart of the beautiful Moon Goddess clenched. This is one of the legacies that the three children of the goddess left behind. This eternal artifact is one of the rarest items to find. Austin, where did you get it from ?\"\nFacing the sparkly eyes of Luna, a smile formed on the blond youth's face, but when he heard the end of her query, his smile broke down.\nLuna also got out of her reverie as she sensed the change in Austin's temperament.\nWith his eyes roaming at a far distant place, Austin sighed before he leaned back on the bed, leaving the perplexed Luna behind.\n\"It's a parting gift from my mother.\"\nLuna raised her brows in astonishment as she stared at the Eternal Stone once again to check whether she saw the right thing. The reason why Luna doubted the stone's credibility was because of the person who brought it to Austin.\nWith just the history of the Stone, Austin was able to discern what importance it carries, which didn't help but increased the number of question marks.\nLying down on Austin's chest Luna encircled her hand over his upper body as she asked in a whispering tone.\n\"When did she come to meet you?\"\nLuna knew how Austin was fond of her mother even though she had treated him indifferently since birth. Maybe, it was confirmed that a man's first love would always be their mother, which made Luna slightly jealous.\nBut more than jealous, she was confused, just like the person himself.\n\"Before the match with Captain Charles.\"\nNow Luna's confusion grew worse as she was sure about the resurrection feature of the Stone, which Austin's mother would also have been aware of.\nThat only means she came to give him something so precious because she was worried about Austin.\nThe proof was evident, and Austin was also aware of the fact. But more than gratification, what he was feeling was distress.\nIf his mother wouldn't have come to meet him or if she hadn't given something so priceless in the name of a parting gift, Austin would have completely forgotten about his family and treated them as strangers.\nBut now....\n'It seems I have to meet you for the last time, mother ...'\n(A/N:- Don't curse him for this since he always has a weak side for his family.)\n____________________________\nAt the same time, when the intimate couple had their morning filled with surprise and realization, a particular group of people consisting of three beautiful girls were gathered in a closed room.\nThe evening sun was drowning in the sky, reaching up to the horizon, with the golden hue spread like a beautiful cover across the nation of Gram.\nThese three women were the remaining party members of the Hero's group who, in the absence of their leader, seemed to become aimless these days.\nVanessa mostly spent her days on the training grounds while trying to calm her racing heart, so she doesn't rush up to the Northern Empire herself.\nLilia was spending her time in libraries and recreational centers to get a hold of herself as she also trained her spells while she was at it.\nAnd as for Sicily, then she was completely drowned in her world, separate from the others and unwilling to meet anyone since the time Kyouki left.\nThe reason why they came to meet, in the room which they haven't turned to since Kyouki left, was a very joyous one.\n\"Finally, tomorrow, Kyou-kun will return to Gram. To us!\"\nSicily, with her eyes filled with warm tears, said in a heavy voice that signified how pleased and excited she was.\n\"Yeah, I can't just wait to see him and ask him how he dared to leave us so alone.\"\nTrying her best to hold her tears, Venessa spoke while sniffing slightly as she stared out the window.\n\"Don't Venessa-san. First, we have to see whether Kyouki-kun is completely fine or not, by staying in such a place. We can't let him suffer more than he already has.\"\nLilia reprimanded the warrior as she said worriedly with tears of joy also adorning her precious eyes as she imagined Kyouki's smiling face making her anxious to meet him even more.\nThe room, which consisted of the three women who were currently on cloud nine since the time they heard the news of their beloved's return, fell silent for some seconds.\nSicily was the one who broke the peaceful silence as she brought up a matter which concerned her most at the moment and which she wanted to resolve before Kyouki's arrival.\nTurning herself toward the two, she naturally grabbed their attention.\n\"I don't know what you guys think about Austin, but I am sure he and Luna genuinely love each other.\"\nLilia became flustered as she heard Austin's name, but Venessa voiced her thoughts first.\n\"Why bring their matter up so suddenly ?\"\n\"Because, after visiting Aurora, I am sure Kyou-Kun must also have become conscious about Luna's choice over him. Now can you imagine how Kyou-Kun would have been feeling after he had seen the person he loves in someone else's arms?\"\nHearing Sicily's remark, Venessa and Lilia blinked profoundly as they registered the words and also became conscious of the fact.\nIt was close to impossible for Austin to have curse energy now when these many things had happened, which meant Luna's affection toward the blond ex-noble was genuine since the start.\nNow, this fact indeed leaves them in guilt, but what made them more worried now was the thought of Kyouki's current state of mind.\nFocusing their gaze upon the eldest person in the room, they heard Sicily speaking something which carried their utmost attention.\n\"Listen, Kyou-kun's will to move forward lies in our support, so when he returns, we have to do our best to make him forget the past and lead the future with us. Whatever happens, we have to make sure Kyou-kun doesn't get involved with Luna anymore.\"\n_____________________\nA/N:- She raised a flag, I didn't.\nAnyway, drop\nEditor - Zenon #4120",

      "content": "Outside the teleportation center of the Eden Academy, stood a vast mass of crowd with similar kinds of expressions on their faces.\nIn these faces, the prominent ones were the Emperor of Gram himself along with some other officials, The Headmaster of the Eden Academy along with every professor standing side by side, and along with other students stood the three fairies who had been dying to see a certain someone.\nJust like the three beauties, every other on the ground had been waiting for a person's arrival for an hour now.\n**DHAK**\nFinally, the center door, which had two nervous-looking guards standing on either side, parted steadily before the image of a raven-haired handsome youth emerged.\nKyouki, with his eyes, narrowed, signifying the difficulty he was having adjusting to the blinding natural light, walked just two steps out of the gate when he heard the loud roar of cheers reverberating.\n\"\"WELCOME BACK! HERO-SAMAAAAAAA\"\"\nKyouki nearly fell back on his butt when suddenly the scream reached up to his senses, but when he finally looked down at the vast crowd, he became a little calm at the same time touched too.\nTears of joy, cheers of victory, and cries of relief resonated among the people as they finally caught a glimpse that faded along with the hero more than a week ago.\nThe three who were standing at the front rushed toward Kyouki in an instant, without minding the shame of being seen before they lunged on the hero, without holding back at all.\n\"Kyouki-kun!\"\n\"Kyou~\"\n\"Kyouki-san!\"\n\"Woah...easy there.\"\nThe three called for him as they hugged him dearly like Kyouki would disappear once they let go.\nBringing his hand on top of their heads, turn by turn, Kyouki said in a very gentle tone as he tried to soothe their anxiety.\n\"There~there. I know I have made you guys worried, but I swear this would be the last time I would ever leave you all like this.\"\n\"You better *sniff*.\"\nThe one who replied with her voice slightly hoarse because of the tears was the red-haired warrior as she finally was able to feel the warmth of the person she had ever fallen in love with.\nThe people around them felt awe and admiration toward the group who were showcasing such a beautiful bond of their love and friendship.\nEveryone entirely ignored the fact of Venessa's engagement as they saw the warrior fawning her love openly toward the Greatest Human of the century.\n…….\nAway from the pleasant atmosphere, which was centered on the reunited group of Hero, stood two figures in the shadows as they gawked at the scene with varying expressions.\n\"Oof. How touching. I might cry like this.\"\nMutter, under her breath, as she wiped her non-existing tears in exaggeration, was the silver-haired saint as she looked down at the crowd while standing beside her beloved.\n\"Don't make fun of them, Luna. Kyouki is someone equivalent to god for them.\"\nStanding beside him was the blond ex-Nobel youth who was looking at the scene with a dry smile as he held Luna's hand lovingly.\nThe duo also left just behind Kyouki, but as one could expect, the protagonist's halo made the duo shadowed, much to their relief.\n\"Should we go?\"\nAustin squeezed Luna's hand as he whispered in a suggestive tone, on which the lady raised her brows before responding.\n\"And where will master Austin take me~.\"\nLuna was very well aware of Austin's mood, and even though she sounded so calm, her mind had been racing since the time she felt his gentle hand peculiarly pressing her.\n\"Umm...to my room...if it's okay?\"\nAustin slightly became nervous as the sudden consciousness of taking Luna to his room to do something unspoken made him a little flustered.\nThe beautiful Saint saw right through his anxiety as a sly smirk formed on her lips before she brought her lips toward his ear and coquettishly whispered her thoughts.\n\"If master Austin wants to take me to his room, then shouldn't he be a bit more forceful~.\"\n_____________\n**THUD**\nJust after stepping inside his room Austin pressed Luna on the closed door as he continuously kissed her in the process.\nLuna's legs were locked on Austin's back as she violently responded to her beloved's greed in her own way.\nThe two love birds played with each others' tongues as they fought for dominance.\n\"Mm~\"\nSuddenly Austin's attack went on Luna's pale neck as he sucked hard on the smooth texture of her jawline further down near her nape.\nLuna subconsciously dug her nails into Austin's back as she threw her head back on the door, giving her lover easy access to her weak spots.\nThe places where Austin's tongue went, a deep red mark was left behind, signifying how wild a kind of lover he becomes once he gets into the heat.\n\"Your skin is just like mochi..\"\nWhispering lovingly in between his kisses, Austin made Luna perplexed by comparing her skin to something she wasn't aware of.\n\"Mochi? What-ahn~\"\nHer words broke down with a moan as she felt a big warm hand gliding inside her dress and pressing down her firm butt quite harshly.\n\"I can't get enough of this ...\"\nDeliberately signifying the love Austin carries for Luna's specific part, Austin began to knead her smooth and elastic ass, much to Luna's ecstasy as she enjoyed the rough treatment.\nAs he kissed her at different places and changed the shape of her heavy cushions with his rough hands, Luna became compassionate before whispering...\n\"Austin takes me~ I can't wait any longer...\"\nPractically begging at the point since her ruthless lover had made her quite excited with his attacks, Luna pleaded with hot steams leaving her moist lips.\nAustin saw his e*rotic partner's current condition, which made his reasoning numb for a second before he complied with her request.\nBut all of a second, his movement halted as his vision grew distant.\n\"Austin?\"\nLuna, who was impatiently waiting to be taken by her man to the bed, saw his change in temperament as she also promptly sobered up a little.\n\"Alex is coming here, and he is quite anxious for some reason.\"\nAustin, who sensed the mana leakage from the incoming presence due to the instability of the person's emotions, felt a slight sense of anxiety himself as Alex was the last person Austin could see getting serious about something.\nLuna, who saw every thought of her not so considered lover, pouted before she got down from his embrace, snatching Austin's attention in the process.\n\"And, of course, this talk would be more important than your woman, right young master?\"\nBefore Austin could have said anything, Luna grumpily went to his bed and covered herself with the blanket while pouting all the time.\nAustin raised his hand to stop her, but since he actually wanted to hear Alex first, he didn't say anything and only smiled in the end.\n\"I will make sure to compensate.\"\n\"You better.\"\nSaying so, Luna cast an invisibility spell over herself as the knock on the door resonated.\n**KNOCK**KNOCK**\nOpening the door, Austin saw the bespectacled court magician who had his all-time toothy grin spread across his face. But unlike usual, he was visibly forcing himself to smile.\n\"I hope I didn't disturb you at a bad time.\"\nAustin felt a chilly sensation from the side of his bed before he replied with a dry smile.\n\"No...um... it's okay. Come in.\"\nAustin invited the court magician, and unlike with Venessa, Alex wasn't blasted away.\n'Oh, right. I forgot to ask her about it.'\nMaking a mental note, Austin gestured on the chair, which was placed beside the tea table as the two men seated while facing each other.\n\"I don't have tea prepared, but if you want-\"\nInterrupting Austin's hospitality, Alex spoke with a brush of his hand as he spoke slightly hurriedly.\n\"Ah, don't worry about it. Instead, I want you to see something.\"\nAustin nodded as he also wanted to know what made Alex so anxious when everyone in the Gram was practically celebrating the hero's comeback.\nAs Alex snapped his fingers, a brownish gray map appeared on the tea table, which had drawings of the national boundaries and demographic features of neighboring countries.\nAustin just glanced at the map for once before he heard the massive revelation of something he had no idea about.\n\"You see these boundaries of the South-Western perimeter which have been ink marked?\"\nOn his remark, Austin turned his head and saw that, indeed, there was a thin, dark marking on the national boundaries of Gram.\n\"That's a horde of demons.\"\nAustin's eyes went slightly wide as, in context to the size of the map, the dark line was almost covering the whole South-Western like it was plaguing the boundaries.\n\"How many?\"\n\"More than three hundred thousand, and each one of them above Rare rank.\"\nAustin raised his brows with his eyes at their broadest reach.\n\"T-that many demons...?\"\nAustin's astonishment was genuine as a single unique rank demon could massacre a whole low-class battalion. Not to talk about that considerable amounts of monsters which undoubtedly must have been led by Terror classes too.\nLuna, who was sitting hidden on the bed, was also shocked since this occurrence wasn't something that had happened anytime in the past since she was born.\n\"Yes, that many. The reason why sir Charles isn't getting any breather in current times is this. He is continuously handling the borders with the help of high-ranking mages and supporters. Since the high-ranking demons were just staying idle, Captain Charles was managing the battlefield somehow. Until...\"\nThe long sigh that Alex released didn't give Austin a good vibe as he waited impatiently for the court magician to continue.\nAlex, after adjusting his spectacle, began to speak about the event which had made him more anxious than the war at the border itself.\n\"It seems someone is working as a spy in the Gram as just when Captain Charles left the battlefield and went to North; the high-ranking demon infiltrated the perimeter in a way which seemed that they were getting directed from someone. The defense fell apart by the enemy forces, and soon before Captain Charles could have taken the reins back in hand, a considerable chunk of the demon army entered the inner perimeter. And now, they are moving at an unstoppable pace in a specific direction.\"\nHearing the load of information, a strong gulp passed Austin's dry throat as he registered each word thoroughly before a basic query erupted in his mind.\n\"Alex...where are those demons heading to...?\"\nAustin had a hunch about what was coming, but upon hearing Alex's confirmation, Austin became sure someone was pulling the strings from a very close proximity.\nWith a defeated smirk, Alex leaned back before he revealed the most fortunate battlefield.\n\"Of course. It's the Eden Academy.\"\n_________________________\nA/N:- Drop a comment~\nEditor : Zenon #4120",

      "content": "In a bright lighted hall which had several wooden chairs placed around a big round table, seated around a dozen people wearing the same kind of uniforms.\nDespite being schoolmates, the groups were divided from the time these students of Eden Academy walked into the hall.\nThe first group consisted of six people, with four of them males, as they seated side by side while continuously glaring at the other two groups.\nThe person who was at the center of this group and relatively also the spokesperson of their party, was a sakura-haired warrior mage who had attained the level of Unique rank in recent days.\n(A/N:-  A quick heads up:- Newbie rank> Warrior Rank> Unique Rank> Veteran Rank> Legendary Rank> Mythic rank> Hero.)\nThe boy was the first student, apart from Hero's party, to gain such a power level in so little amount of time since he joined the school,  and not only him, but the team he leads also has also gained a relatively good amount of boost due to the exploration they venture.\nThe second group consisted of four people who mainly had the spotlight in the room.\nSitting while chatting noiselessly was the Hero's party as they were also the ones who were invited just after the day of Kyouki's return.\nSince the call was from the central authority of the Gram, the hero's party gave the meeting their utmost attention and gathered, among others, without delaying an extra second, unlike the person himself who called them here.\nThe last group, or to be precise, the duo, who were chatting in a way that seemed they were ignoring the whole surrounding, consisted of Luna and Austin.\nThe couple was getting eyed by various among people who came here because of the same purpose as them, but nothing seemed to affect them at all.\nStrangely, Kyouki was also completely unbothered by Luna's intimacy with Austin, like he had forgotten about her entirely or something.\nSicily had a close eye on Kyouki's behavior, and after sensing his aloofness toward the Saint, she became pretty perplexed, at the same time, elated.\nNothing she would wish more, than if Kyouki actually gets over Luna, but at the end of the day, that 'if' was everything to make her worried about the hero's future as well as herself's too.\nSuddenly amidst the chattering and gossip, the main entrance of the meeting hall slowly parted before the figure of a charismatic young man appeared on the other side.\nThe man, who visibly by facial aesthetic looked in his early twenties, had platinum blond hair with pair of blue orbs adorning his carved eyes. His chiseled physique was absolutely stunning with the height he walked on.\nThe man walked with his boots making a slight clanking sound on the ground, before he halted his feet right before the group of students.\n\"Hello, dear students. Myself, Mikhail der Gramduör, the second prince of the empire and currently working as a militant organizer.\"\nSuddenly the sound of chairs being pushed back resonated as the group of students stood up after they got out of their trance.\n\"\"We greet you, your highness.\"\"\nApart from Luna and Austin, everyone stood up as they bowed simultaneously to the person who held the most authority after the Emperor, on the whole continent.\nMikhail glanced at the duo, who were staring at him indifferently as he had just interrupted their sweet times before he gestured for everyone to sit down.\n\"Please make yourself comfortable since we aren't here for any official ceremony or something.\"\nBrushing off the etiquette, Mikhail took off his overcoat before draping it over one of the empty chairs. As his lean physique became more exposed, a sigh of awe left the lips of the two girls who belonged to the explorer group. (The group of six)\nAfter taking the chair he used as a hanger, Mikhail sat straight back on it before he glanced over the group of students, and after halting on a particular entity just for a second, he continued.\n\"This matter which I am going to tell you, please try to keep it to yourself until it becomes pronounced to hide.\"\nThe expression of various became profound as they heard the remark of the second prince before several nods flowed in response.\nSighing, Mikhail finally gave out the piece of information, which made the almost audience shocked in a fret.\n\"A number of more than seven thousand cursed demons above the Unique Rank are approaching the Eden's Academy at an indefinite pace. The front line has been arranged around the academy, but still, I want you guys to perform as a backup if some mishappening occurs.\"\nA gasp resonated in the hall as the group of teenagers, mainly from the explorer groups, heard the prince loud and clear.\nMost of them had some kind of expression except for the blond youth and the Saint.\nMikhail studied their reaction and concluded that, indeed, they were already informed about the terrifying news as a soft inward chuckle erupted inside of him.\n'This court magician really does have a loose lip.....'\n\"Above Unique Rank, that means...\"\nIt was Kyouki who asked the thing he feared the most to get affirmed. With his serious expression turning grave, he, as well as others, heard the terrifying part of the intel.\n\"Yeah, there are Terror ranked too, among the demon army.\"\nThis time the hall fell into silence as the piece of information was far from what they could digest so casually.\nA low-grade Terror Rank demon was far more potent than a horde of high-grade Unique ranked. Even if they could team up altogether, the group of the six wasn't sure whether they could even inflict damage on a Terror Rank. Not to talk about, there would be loads of those demons.\nLeaving them, even Kyouki wasn't sure whether he would be able to take more than one Terror ranked with his ultimate light spell. And thinking about the danger of being attacked by other demons when he would be at his vulnerable stage after the Spell, he and his party members felt cold shivers running down their spines.\n\"Your highness, how can we even face such numbers when we wouldn't be able to even handle their curse energy in the first place? Leaving the vanguard of school, we won't be able to save ourselves even if we all work together, which is most unlikely.\"\nThe sakura-haired boy, Riley, spoke in a heavy tone that most others agreed with too.\nLeaving the working together part, there was no chance of them withstanding the heavy miasma of the curse energy. Even if they used buffs provided by top healers, it would not make any sense if they would just become fodder in front of the disaster-level beings.\nMikhail heard the words of the person who spoke for most of them before he opened his mouth to calm their anxiety.\n\"Don't worry. You will be provided with the support of the professors and the headmaster too. And along with them, you will be using the artifacts and weapons directly exported from the Capital's treasury. Now, how about it?\"\nThe eyes of various, including the three women from Hero's party, sparkled as they heard about the privilege that very few people could enjoy in their lifetime.\nA single piece of material belonging to a national treasure was equivalent to a person's whole life fortune. That kind of thing fills the treasury of the palace. And the thought of using the weapons which have been preserved since ancient times, made the young blood boil in excitement.\nAmidst of the enthrallment and exhilaration, a deep voice reached up to everyone's senses as they turned their attention instantly toward it.\n\"Can I ask something related to the battlefield?\"\nAustin's first word in the matter wasn't related to reward or the treasures since he wasn't interested in them from the start, but something which would determine whether he would be cooperating with the others or not.\n\"Yes, Austin. Please ask freely.\"\nMikhail nodded non-hesitantly as a slight relief spread across his chest that the blonde youth was actually paying heed to the matters which, in actuality, required his utmost attention.\n\"On the battlefield, would others command me, or can I enjoy my freedom without restraints?\"\nThe matter which concerned Austin was also felt by others since being ordered around at times when their life would be on line, didn't gave a good vibe.\nOn Austin's query, and knowing full well what depended on his responses, Mikhail's face soon got covered with a wide grin as he spoke without letting the listener wait more than necessary.\n\"It's the same as you wish, Austin. No one. I repeat, no one would have the authority to command you all when you will land your feet on the battlefield. So rein free and protect your school without holding back. \"\n____________________\nA/N:- The interaction of Luna and Venessa before this meeting would be spicy, no?\nShould I write a side story?",

      "content": "It's been only two days since the announcement about the incoming catastrophe was made to some selected students of Eden's Academy.\nTo say, the groups were shocked would be an understatement. Petrified would be the exact emotion, most of them felt after hearing something beyond belief.\nDuring these two days, the front line from the Royal Palace was arranged at a distance from the Eden Academy, with elites of the warrior and mages working day and night to ensure the safety of the next generation.\nStudents were also disallowed to leave the school territory in the name of the practical test, which would be happening in some days. This decision discontented students, but in the end, no one wanted to breach the academy's rule and get rusticated.\nExcept for the chosen twelve students, along with the professors and Headmaster Merlin, no one was aware of the possible danger which could reach up to the school gates in the worst-case scenario.\nNaturally, the twelve chosen ones weren't forced to join classes at these times when the primary activity they should be doing was to enhance their skill and try to gain as much boost as they could before the big possible event.\nAnd for the exact same purpose, the group of twelve was invited to an indoor practice gym of the academy without letting the other students know about the session.\nThe school gym was a big hall of more than 300sq ft. Since Space Magic was utilized to build the gym, the exterior of the building looks like standard house size, but from the inside, it was colossal.\nIn a separate corner of the vast hall stood a certain amount of people with varying expressions on their faces.\nApart from the twelve chosen students of the academy, a humungous man was standing at the height of 198 cm and face filled with minor and significant scars.\nThis person was a high-ranking Knight from the Royal order who came to the academy to delegate the weapons and artifacts which the capital decided to invest in the vanguard unit, temporarily.\nThe Royal Knight handed the relics and the weaponry to each student without much evaluation since it wasn't required.\nEveryone received the treasure directly exported from the treasure, with open hands, except for a peculiar duo...\n\"Saint-sama? Sir Austin? Are you both sure you don't want the vault items? I mean, I know you both are exceptional warrior and healer, but still, the incoming threat isn't something you should take lightly.\"\nThe Knight was aware of the level of Healing magic Luna carries, which also has helped her gain the title of 'Humanity's Hope', and the fight with Charles made it clear what potential Austin brings. But the thought of them jumping on the battlefield without the support of such high-grade items felt too absurd.\n\"It's as you head, Sir Rachael. Luna and I don't need artifacts since we like to use what we already have.\"\n(A/N:- I know Rachael is a feminine name, but I just wanted to use it)\nKyouki side glanced at Luna and found her aloofly agreeing with Austin's words without any desire to speak for herself.\nOn the other hand, upon hearing Austin's remark, the Royal Knight frowned slightly before he rubbed his chin while studying Austin's equipment.\nThe blond youth was currently wearing a standard leather vest with a cross belt over either shoulder, making a cross on his chest. The two holders on each belt sheathed daggers, which Austin had seen most using in battles.\nRachael thought for a moment, and in the end, he wasn't able to hold his curiosity, as he asked with an embarrassed smile.\n\"Umm, sir Austin. Just to assure myself, can I check your equipment?\"\nAustin's eyes went round because of the suddenness of the request before he nodded non-hesitantly.\n\"Yeah, sure.\"\nSaying so, Austin took out one of his daggers before throwing it in a reverse grip toward the Knight.\n**SWISH**\nAs expected from a Knight who has made his way to the royal army, he was able to catch the dagger fluently without showing any sign of discomfort even the speed with which Austin threw his weapon made various wide-eyed.\nRachael, after receiving the dagger, frowned slightly as the energy which the blade was radiating was not something he expected to feel from such a standard-looking weapon.\nThe blade was made of an alloy that Rachael wasn't able to identify since its texture and shade were utterly different from standard metal.\nThe black material used at the handle made the weapon strangely stable and quick to wield. Not to talk about the hilt with the grip, which seemed to gripping the user itself, further subduing the chance of slipping away during the battle.\n'It's an artifact? Or demon material-manufactured?\"\nRachael tried to the thought of the daggers forgery, but in the end, he could only let out a dry laugh accompanying his defeat.\n\"Here, Sir Austin. It seems I am not experienced enough to discern your arsenal.\"\nThe room became extremely silent as they heard the casual remark of the soldier who, despite being a veteran of the battlefield and a person who undoubtedly has seen various things throughout his life, admitting defeat for such a typical dagger.\nAustin, on the other hand, wasn't bothered as he knew the material which was used to make the dagger doesn't belong to this world, so Rachael's lack of knowledge seemed justifiable to him.\n\"Then why not, you hand over Austin and Luna-san's portion of weaponry and artifacts to us?\"\nThe one whose voice reverberated and gathered everyone's attention was a cemented shade-haired boy from the explorer group, named Kevin.\nThis thought also came up in the minds of some others in the Explorer group, but the slim long-haired boy was the only one who voiced his intention.\nUpon hearing the clear greedy thought of the student, Rachael rolled his eyes before he turned himself toward the center and, while looking at particularly no one, asked in a loud voice.\n\"Does anyone know about the term 'Overload Dysfunctioning?'\nUpon being asked about something out of nowhere, everyone seemed to be taken aback as this term was indeed unheard of by them. Only a single hand was raised from the audience, grabbing everyone's attention.\n\"Sir Austin?\"\n\"If my memory serves correct, then it is a phenomenon which a warrior might face if they overload themselves with weaponry and potions which exceed their capability. In a minor situation, the over-bearer might suffer from partial paralysis, but sometimes death comes out as a conclusion of tolling themselves with something they couldn't handle.\"\nDead silence surrounded the atmosphere as Austin's explanation concluded.\nKevin, along with those who were with the idea of testing Austin and Luna's weapon, backed away in an instant as their head drowned in embarrassment.\nOnly the silver-haired saint had a smug adorning her charming face as she felt utter proud of her man's range of knowledge. She herself wasn't aware of the term but was confident that whatever Austin said must be true.\n\"The level of weapons I have brought have been evaluated in the main palace first under the close supervision of high appraisers. Every weapon and relic is assigned according to the user's capability. So I think your suggestion, student Kevin, was futile since the start as what Master Austin and Luna-sama have been granted isn't something anyone other than Hero-sama could wield.\"\nThe look in the eyes of the hero's party other than Kyouki, made it clear that they felt insulted by the remark, but in the end, no one spoke regarding the matter.\nAfter checking everyone's silent expression, Rachael began to speak about the main event of today, for which he himself was pretty excited.\n\"Okay then. Since you have held your temporary battlefield partners in hand, let's get along with them, shall we?\"\nAs Rachael said, he snapped his finger before, with a clicking sound; a battle arena became ignited just behind him.\nThe people who saw the battle arena became thrilled at once as they knew what was coming, and Rachael's following word made their expectations clear.\n\"The best way to know your weapon is to use it in battle. So, without further ado, I would like to call a volunteer who would commence today's practice session.\"\nWithout waiting, Venessa raised her hand before she rushed toward the arena without even waiting for Rachael to affirm her participation.\nSince everyone was aware of the battle-loving trait of the red-headed warrior, no one objected to her advance as they waited for Rachael's continuation of the announcement.\n\"Okay, then. Who would like to be the opponent in this first friendly spar?\"\nBefore anyone could have even thought of rivaling Venessa in the arena, a pale white hand raised high as an authoritative yet elegant voice resonated among all.\n\"I will take her on.\"\n_______________\nA/N:- Guess who;)",

      "content": "\"Saint-sama? A-are you sure-\".\nRachael tried to pursue Luna from participating in the spar with Venessa considering Luna's attribute, which was mainly focused on healing.\nBut he was abruptly interrupted by the platinum-haired beautiful girl, who had a blank expression adorning her moon-white face.\n\"I think being restrained wasn't something I was told by the Second Prince. Or should I reconsider my participation in this whole mess?\"\nDevoid of any kind of emotions blended in her tone, Luna voiced her thoughts which made the listeners slightly shiver in a fret.\nEven Austin gulped upon hearing her current voice, which clearly told her inner emotions.\nThe receiver of such words felt tremors running down his spine as he heard the voice of the person he had never thought of being so scary.\n'Aren't all healers jolly by nature?'\nQuestioning his past knowledge, Rachael didn't say anything else before Luna walked towards the arena where the red-headed warrior stood, looking at the scene with a complicated expression.\nThe expression on Kyouki's face was in between being troubled and hesitant, which didn't go unnoticed by Sicily just beside him.\nLilia also had a troubled expression adorning her usually calm face, as she didn't want to see her two friends sparring for some reason.\nAnd as for Austin...\n'I hope she just doesn't kill her....'\nHe was the only one who was aware of Luna's absurd might, which made the blond youth worried about the possible conclusion of the battle.\n\"I hope you aren't doing this because of the baseless engagement my father forced upon us...\"\nVanessa muttered under her breath as from what she sensed from the conversation they had two days ago; Luna was clearly affected by the meaningless betrothal.\n\"Well, won't you find it yourself, why I came to destro-oops! To spar with my dearest friend?\"\nA thick vein bulged on Venessa's forehead as she clearly took the provocation before she readied the spear that she obtained from the capital treasury.\nSwirling it masterfully on her hands, a golden hue spread around Venessa before she pointed the tip of the spear towards her opponent before she called for the commencement.\n\"Come at me with your strongest.\"\nLuna smirked slightly before she manifested a thin sword made of crystalline ice in each hand.\nThe figure of Luna, who was currently wearing the black battle suit with her alluring hair tied in a ponytail as she held the ice sword just like her clear blue eyes, made her look nothing less than a battle goddess descended upon the lower lands.\nVarious from the crowd, regardless of gender, felt their heart skipping a beat as they saw the current Luna, who, unlike her calm self, looked more domineeringly charming.\nWith a confident smirk on her face, Luna disappeared from her site like a gust which made those below Unique Rank astonished and unable to track Luna's movement.\n**CLANG**\nThe sound of metal colliding with some similar material, resonated heavily as Luna appeared in mid-air just behind Venessa's back.\nThe heavy staff of the spear, which Venessa brought on her back without turning, trembled as she blocked Luna's ice sword, putting unexpected pressure on the amber-haired warrior's arm.\n\"Not so fast, girl.\"\nLuna instantly backed away as she felt Venessa charging at her with the momentum.\nVanessa's spear slashed through the air as a massive gust of dust erupted right beneath the place she swung her weapon.\n\"Woah...\"\nVanessa enjoyed the sensation she felt from her weapon responding and synchronizing with her expectancy even though she had been wielding it for the first time.\nClutching the neck of the spear, a dangerous grin formed across Venessa's face as she launched herself toward Luna, who was standing solemnly at her place.\n**SWISSH**\nWith her body darting at a far higher pace than Luna primarily moved, Venessa launched her whole body with her spear at the front toward her opponent.\n'Huh...?'\nJust as Venessa's spearhead was about to come in contact with Luna's right arm, which indeed would have impaled the receiver, Venessa's vision blurred as a cloud of snow emerged from nowhere.\nBefore she could have realized it, Luna had already moved from her place using the illusion before she appeared right beside Vannesa as she kicked the warrior right at the base of her abdomen.\n\"GAH!!\"\nThe impact was heavier than one could expect from such a delicate-looking saint as Venessa flew to a distance of more than thirty meters before she dropped to the ground.\n\"Ohh!\"\nSomeone from the audience gasped as they saw the fighting prowess of Luna, who, despite being a healer mage, was able to draw hand-to-hand combat so skillfully.\nThe most shocked was Kyouki at the moment. He has spent almost half a year with Luna and always paid his utmost attention to her. But never did he expect that the Healer he always thought of working as a supporter and the woman he always thought of protecting was actually this strong.\nVenessa, on the other hand, being humiliated to this level, became serious for the spar, as using her spear as a support, she pushed her body up.\n\"Don't regret this, Luna.\"\nWith a heavy tone, Venessa muttered with a slightly unsteady breath before relaunching toward Luna with her utmost speed, reaching up to the other side in less than two blinks.\n**CLING**\n**CLANG**\nThe exchange between the two women initiated with the sound of heavy material colliding and releasing spark across the arena.\nThe figures of the two warriors disappeared from the site before appearing at different corners, all while exchanging their unwavering blows, which seemed to be in complete sync.\nNeither Venessa was pushed back, nor Luna, but the damage from the exchange was getting inflicted on both.\nThe audience was so mesmerized by such a sight that they weren't daring to blink in order not to miss even a single moment of such a captivating battle.\n**TNNNG**\nWith a heavy glass-breaking sound, the two warriors separated from each other as they slid apart for some distance.\nThe condition of either one was not the same as they initially were. Both women were panting slightly with their porcelain faces, dyed in crimson due to the excessive blood flow across their bodies.\nVenessa's armor was slightly scratched at some points, but other than that, she was completely fine with her weapon, still steadily waiting to exchange another hefty round.\nBut on the other side, Luna had an evident injury across her right cheek as crimson blood dripped down from the slash like an unstoppable stream. Her armor wasn't significantly damaged, but the wound on her face stated clearly how the first round went for her.\nBut looking at her indifferent expression, it seemed she was not bothered by such things at all as she readied her still shining ice sword in Venessa's direction.\nBut before the two could have engaged in battle again, a heavy and authoritative voice resonated in the hall.\n\"Luna.\"\nNaturally, every gaze was snatched from the arena toward the voice as Luna also turned her head toward the person she only turns to.\nStanding there was the handsome blond teen with his eyes exposing something that Luna was only able to understand. For others, he was just looking at the Saint with a straight gaze, nothing peculiar.\nLuna, upon receiving the words of her beloved, pouted slightly before she turned away, but not being able to ignore his gaze, she finally gave in.\n\"Fine. \"\nGrumbling, the injury on Luna's cheek soon got covered in a greenish hue before the wound completely disappeared from existence.\nWhile at it, Luna also disintegrated her twin ice sword, naturally attracting her opponent as she asked with her brows raised.\n\"Already done? I thought I could play for some more time.\"\nThere was complete amusement on Venessa's face as she directed her own provocative words toward her opponent.\nBut little did the warrior imagine that Luna would not pay single heed to her provocations before she would feel the chills of her life.\nLuna strengthened her body with mana and disappeared from her site at a pace that was equivalent to Austin's before she crossed more than 50 meters in less than a second and stood with her body slightly stretched forward, just before Venessa.\nWith her five fingers connected to Venessa's chest, Luna muttered under her breath before concluding the match.\n\"This isn't the end.\"\n**BOOOOOOMM*\nLike the enormous air cannon blasting in a silent war field, the place where Venessa was standing a moment ago was now occupied by Luna as the prior was thrown out of the battlefield with just a single push of Luna!\nThe people who were able to see Venessa blasting away were only two, in which one of them instantly left his place to stop Venessa before she crashed into the gym wall.\n**DHAAAAKKKK**\nRachael was somehow able to catch Venessa's body which was flying like a broken kite in the air at a furious pace.\nThe force was so extreme that even Rachael was pushed back for several meters in mid-air before he finally halted his and Venessa's momentum.\nWith every eye becoming wide at the unexpected and beyond belief spectacle, there was only a single person who was shaking his head in defeat as he saw his lover returning from the arena like nothing sort of mentioning happened.\n'I hope Charles just doesn't land again for a battle.....'\n___________________\nA/N:- No more confrontation. The next chapter would be leisure before the commencement of a big event and Austin's last mandatory week of the Villain system.\nEditor : Zenon #4120",

      "content": "\"I am gonna rip that smug apart from her! Leave me!!\"\nNearly shouted at the end of her intentions was the red-haired warrior Venessa Charles who, after losing to Luna, was brought to the infirmary since she lost consciousness from Luna's blow.\nThe training session was called off after the first friendly spar(?) as the situation went out of hand already during the commencement.\nRachael told the chosen ones that he would be present on the school grounds until the incoming danger didn't vanquish, so the chosen ones were free to come and spar with Rachael anytime, and the chosen ones also wanted to get used to their newfound arsenal.\nCurrently, in the infirmary, apart from Venessa, her other party members were also present inside the cabin, which was granted for Venessa's treatment, considering her position in the school.\nVanessa, as soon after regaining her consciousness, jolted to dart at that very moment as she dearly desired to return what she received from the saint.\nIt was the second time she had been humiliated like this, yet she wasn't able to do anything!\n\"Let me go!\"\nShe flailed her limbs as she tried to break the binding chains which Lilia had cast even before Venessa woke up since the three other members of the party were aware of her personality.\nLast time she kept her mouth shut because Kyouki would have been affected if she was to hurt Austin. But this time?\n\"Venessa-san. Please calm down and listen to me.\"\nSeeing her struggling both physically as well as mentally, Kyouki sat beside the agitated woman before he placed his hand on her restrained hand.\nVanessa immediately halted her struggle as she felt the warm sensation upon herself before she directed her eyes toward the gentle gaze Kyouki was emitting.\n*BA*DUMB*\nLilia and Sicily sighed in relief as they saw Venessa finally calming down, thanks to their leader taking the lead.\n\"I know you must have been feeling frustrated. I know you want to get back at Luna, but is it really worth it? Luna has changed; she has forgotten all our relations but are you also the same? Do you not consider Luna as your friend anymore?\"\nThroughout his persuasion, Venessa kept her mouth closed as her clenched fist loosened slowly upon hearing the conclusion of Kyouki's reasoning.\nHer heart fluttered violently as she somehow understood why Kyouki was going out of his way to make her understand this, which made her enthralled.\n'How can a person be so caring for someone like me.'\nOn the other hand, Sicily had a complicated emotion rummaging inside her heart, which she didn't let show on her face.\nThere was a side of her that knew Kyouki was inwardly trying to stop Venessa for her own safety.\nIt seemed apart from the victim herself, the rest of the three in the party were now aware of Luna's actual strength, which they weren't aware of until now.\n'How would she react if she gets to know the truth...'\nSicily shivered slightly as the thought of letting Venessa face the silver saint again, made the olive-haired supporter mage conclude only one result.\nAnd that was the end of Venessa.\n\"Kyouki-Kun. What about the practice with your new artifacts and weapons? Will you train with Sir Rachael?\"\nLilia asked the thing which concerned not only her but the entire Eden's academy as the hero's participation in the vanguard would be very crucial. And to ensure the hero's safety at his best, practice spar was necessary so he could become used to his newfound armaments.\nKyouki thought for a second before he replied with a long sigh.\n\"Even if I want to practice with Sir Rachael, I highly doubt he would be able to help. I need someone above my level to feel the challenge and grow exponentially. And, I don't think there is someone like this on the school grounds.\"\nVanessa, despite wanting to help Kyouki, remained silent since she knew the difference between their power level.\nFor instance, Lilia wanted to bring Austin's name forward, but in the end, she kept her mouth closed since it felt wrong to bring her ex-fiancè's name as it would sound like she was praising him.\nIt was Sicily who came up with an idea as she spoke in a slightly doubtful tone.\n\"If it's about swords...then I think I can ask for help. But don't take my word since I don't know whether I would be able to pursue that man.\"\nKyouki made a complicated face as, without a word, he nodded.\n__________________\nAt the same time, when the meeting of the hero's party was undergoing in the infirmary, a specific duo was sharing their loving time in a cozy, dimly lit room.\n\"You went too far, Luna.\"\nAustin applied ointment at the place where Luna's face was hurt as he spoke with a helpless sigh. He wasn't frustrated with her; instead felt her actions cute?\nOf course, he won't tell her, or she might blast Venessa again without telling the person what happened so suddenly.\n\"Are you worried for her?\"\nWith her eyes staring continuously at Austin's expression, which she seems found tough to discern, Luna asked in a cold tone.\n\"Of course not. I just think your anger is worthless to someone like her.\"\nLuna, upon hearing his remark, narrowed her eyes before she asked in a colder tone.\n\"Who is angry with whom? And why would I be mad at that muscle head?\"\nLuna's remark displayed that she was just participating in the spar for training and such, even though she didn't acquire any weapon. But Austin was very well aware of the meek saint's hidden side.\n\"You aren't mad at Vanessa?\"\nUpon being targeted so directly, Luna rounded her eyes before she gazed away from her not-so-fair lover.\n\"Luna...?\"\nAustin, with an amused smile, pursued the escaping Luna as he narrowed his eyes in pure glee.\nLuna, after being gazed at for so long (three seconds), finally lost her temper as she turned her face toward Austin before she opened the box of her complaints.\n\"How can I not be angry?! That woman got engaged with you in my absence, and even responded to you shyly when you greeted her. I mean, I ain't a blind ass who can't see her wavering bitchy emotions! And not to talk about that ex-fiancé of yours who just doesn't know how to control her tits at all. Did you see her troubled expression when I pressed myself on you? Hah! She even glared at me! How dare she! I mean, I know she was connected to you before, but now you are her ex! Freakin ex! Can't she just ride one boat for once? First, that midget Lilia got engaged with you, and now this muscle brain. Now I fear about that Sicily girl. Everyone is getting engaged with you, and here I haven't even gone on a date with the person I love! Haha...isn't it hilarious? I might end every woman from this world like this!\"\nConcluding with her crowd of words, Luna started panting slightly with her face dyed in red due to the momentum she spoke with.\nAustin heard every word of her while caressing her hand to calm her, but nothing affected Luna because of the frustration she had accumulated since Aurora.\nAfter some seconds, Luna realized that she had spoken more than necessary as she slowly turned her head toward Austin with fear of being hated rising dramatically inside her mind.\n\"Luna...\"\nHearing his slightly cold tone, Luna's heart trembled as she felt something irreversible had taken place because of her whining and heavy emotions.\nBut little did she imagine that Austin's following word would be centered at a particular part of her complaint.\n\"Let's go on a date.\"\n\"...\"\n_____________________\nA/N:- Yandere side kicking in...\nLuna is just like that, so pls don't hate her.\nAnd drop a comment\nEditor : Zenon #4120",

      "content": "[Luna's POV:]\n'I am nervous...'\nThe last time I felt nervous was when I first came to Austin's room after the Jungle expedition.\nAnd that time too, when he came to meet me in Aurora.\nAnd that too, when he kissed me...\nAnd when he did this and that with me...\nAnd when...\n'Argh! Why am I getting nervous like this so often?!'\nI facepalmed myself as I thought how I was getting highly strung by a single person in so little time.\nEven though that single person is someone I adore, I think I am getting really sloppy these days, which I strangely don't feel much bad about.\nWell, displaying my nervous self to the world would be unacceptable, but Austin would not mind this messy me who gets nervous just because of being invited on a date.\n'Yeah, and maybe Austin would like this nervous side of mine…but he likes my domineering side too ...what if the perfect wifey aura disappears just because I won't be able to get myself together..'\nI plopped down on the ground while thinking about the various possibilities.\nIt wasn't that I like to whine like this, but since I have fallen in love with Austin, I have become a woman who just couldn't control her emotions at all when it comes to the man I want to spend my life with.\n'Will I end up ruining our first date like this...?'\nA dark cloud emerged inside my mind as I slowly lifted my head and saw my face in the mirror I was sitting in front of.\nMy gaze fell at the place where still lingered the gel that Austin put on me. The sensation of his warm hand blended with the cool antiseptic made me warm from inside.\nBefore I could help, I was already missing him, so after exhaling deeply in determination, I got up from my place.\nWalking toward my wardrobe, I resolved to make this date the best of our experience.\n'Just wait for me, Austin. Your Luna will make this date memorable enough not to let you forget about it even in your sleep.'\n______________\nDespite promising and steeling her resolve for more than two hours, when Luna finally came to the place where she was meant to meet Austin, Luna became nervous again beyond belief.\nThe place where they decided to rendezvous was near the Library entrance around 4 in the noon. But Luna arrived at 2 and stood still with an invisibility shroud over herself to avoid unwanted gazes.\nShe wasn't sure why she was not nervous at this point when they already had sex, not once but twice now!\n'Mm...what should I do...'\nSitting on a bench near the library backyard, Luna thought of the possibility that she might unintentionally do, which could ruin the date.\n**Sigh**\nA long sigh left her lips as she drowned in her world, when suddenly a voice called out for her?\n\"Luna...you are here, right?\"\nShe almost jumped to her feet when she heard a ridiculously familiar voice just beside her ear.\n\"Au-Austin? You can see me?!\"\nShe subconsciously called for him, even though she found his eyes unfocused, signifying he really wasn't seeing her.\n\"No, I just caught your fragrance.\"\nLuna didn't reply because she fell into a daze upon seeing Austin's current appearance.\nHe was wearing a long crimson coat that reached up to his upper thighs with a plain white shirt along with high waist black trousers. His hair, unlike usual, was combed neatly at one side with a slightly flushed face, signifying the healthy tone of skin that was affected by the sunlight.\nThe current Austin entirely mesmerized Luna. She loves the usual Austin, too, as he seems the most adorable person to her. But the present Austin looked more adult and charming.\n\"Luna? Are you there?\"\nAs Austin sat on the bench, he asked with his gaze still, trying to perceive at least the silhouette of his date, but as expected of such a powerful mage. She doesn't leave any loopholes.\n\"W-why is Austin so early when we planned to meet at 4?\"\nDespite being in complete contemplation since she came here, Luna still had some sense of time left in her so she could prepare herself appropriately.\n\"Well, I believe it's rude to let a lady wait, so I arrived early. But what about you, Luna? Why are you sitting alone like this?\"\nBeing asked so suddenly, Luna became flustered as she replied in a slight rush.\n\"I-I just wanted to take a summer bath.\"\nAustin, even without seeing her face, was somehow sure that currently, Luna was blushing as her voice seemed to be forcing her false reasoning.\nBut he didn't point it out, since he knew it would make her angry.\nSoon, silence fell between the two as the time passed.\nFor passersby, only a young, handsome boy was visible, who was sitting alone on the bench wordlessly. Some wanted to approach him, but something told those passers-by that approaching Austin would result in something ominous.\nAustin, was the one who broke the silence in between as, while gawking toward his front, he muttered with a hazy voice.\n\"Are you nervous?\"\nIf someone gets hit with something they were most concerned about, then getting flustered would be the least thing that could happen.\nAnd Luna was the same...\n\"Hah! Me and nervous? Of course not. Why would I be?\"\nLuna crossed her arms under her bosom as she announced in a slightly shaky tone.\n\"Well, to be honest, I am really nervous right now. It's my first date, after all.\"\nLuna's eyes went wide as she heard Austin's honest remark. In the chaos of her unsettling thoughts, she completely forgot about Austin.\n\"You know, choosing my clothes and thinking about what I should do to make this date perfect made me restless at the same time, so excited that I fought that urge to come here even earlier. Even though I am sitting with you right here, my heart is pounding like crazy to think that I am on a date with such a beautiful girl.\"\nLuna, from start to end, was so flabbergasted that she even forgot to breathe. What she was feeling since morning was also felt by Austin, which made her delighted as well as idiotic, not to be honest with him.\nBringing her hand slowly on top of Austin's, she found him turning toward her before she undid her spell.\n\"To be honest with you, Austin, I am also at the edge right now. Just like you, I was also having trouble with what to wear or what to say. And right now, when I saw you looking so dashing, I felt my heart beating like crazy. So don't assume you are alone in this. I am equally nervous too.\"\nAs Austin saw Luna for the first time today, his sense of reasoning evaporated as with his mouth agape; he stared at her for quite a decent time when he finally realized his rude behavior.\nHolding her hand back, Austin gave a bright smile before he muttered in a soft tone.\n\"Since we are feeling the same, then why not take things slowly and enjoy our date on our one way?\"\nLuna, upon hearing Austin's positive remark, smiled instantly as, with her eyes growing hazy, she nodded.\n\"Mm. Let's do that.\"\n___________________________\nA/N:- Both are newbies to dating, just like the author.\nAnyway, drop a comment~\nEditor : Zenon #4120",

      "content": "\"So, where are we going?\"\nUnder the lazy sunlight, a couple consisting of a stunning woman and a handsome Nobel-looking youth strolled on the stone-paved path near the Academy Library.\nAustin was having quite a hard time keeping his gaze straight because of Luna's current appearance.\nHer silver-platinum hair was tied in a ponytail, which gave her a sense of peculiar charm and made her look a little younger than her usual self.\nThere was a frilly floral top on her upper body, which exposed a lot of her finely shaped moon-white arms. Her lower body was dangerously exposed up to her lower thighs as above; she wore a coffee-brown skirt which defined her perfect figure exceptionally.\nThe light make-up on her face, with a very thin redness adorning her supple lips, made Luna look like a doll from fairy tales, whom Austin couldn't help but gawk from time to time.\nAnd not only Austin, but the other students and even faculties, upon witnessing Luna's current appearance, which was far more youthful and fluffy than her usual attire, became speechless for several seconds.\nIt would be a huge understatement to say that Austin was nervous, walking with such a beautiful girl whom he could have only dreamt of even talking to once in his previous life.\n\"Hmm...how about we go to the market in the nearby town?\"\nAustin suggested as any place he knew inside the Eden Academy wasn't entertaining, nor any place nearby, as the whole school was surrounded by jungles and lairs.\n\"Hmm, if it's like that, then I can take us to a place. Although it's not near, but I think you might like it.\"\nSince the whole school was barricaded and leaving the perimeters of the safety line was prohibited entirely, Austin was planning to use levitation to escape, but he nearly forgot that Luna was proficient with space magic too.\n\"Please lead the way, my lady.\"\nAustin wanted to take charge of the date, but he wasn't a stubborn idiot who would get reluctant to let his woman handle some of the things.\nA small smile formed on Luna's lips before she closed her eyes, only to open them when a huge pale blue magic circle enveloped the couple.\n**SWISSH**\nThe wind howled as the magic circle swallowed the two, only to transfer them to a place where Luna undoubtedly visited enough to get that place embedded in her memory.\n________________\nThe next place, the duo opened their eyes after a concise journey, was a dark alley.\nAustin looked around quite curiously as he studied the place, but since it was only an alley, he wasn't able to discern anything.\n\"Here, Austin. Eat this.\"\nAustin saw the algae-colored herb, which looked similar to what he gave to Kyouki when he was leaving for Aurora with him.\n\"This...?\"\nAs Austin asked, he saw Luna already ate one of those herbs which she gave him before her hair shade drastically shifted to a darker tone.\n\"Don't worry; it won't change your facial features but only your hair color. Since we both have a peculiar shade which might raise suspicion, we better not take the chance.\"\nAustin understood her intentions before he nodded and gulped down the bitter herb, which tasted like raw coffee powder.\nSame as Luna, Austin's hair also took a darker shade and only halted before converting his blond hair into a midnight raven.\nLuna, who saw the change, was smiling quite happily before Austin asked her the reason for such.\n\"We have something in common now.\"\nA slightly shy smile formed on Austin's lips, too, as he heard something which he also noticed but was embarrassed to point out.\n\"Shall we go?\"\nLuna extended her hand toward her beloved as she smiled brightly.\nAustin, without making her wait, joined hands before he muttered softly.\n\"Yeah, let's go.\"\nIntervening his fingers with hers, they both walked out of the alley before an incredible sight greeted them both.\n\"Woah...\"\nAustin's eyes sparkled as he saw the town they had just walked in, which was so colorful and filled with joy that he felt he had just entered a new world.\nThere were a lot of markets arrangely working on either side of a wide stone path. Since it seemed that this place was indeed quite far, the current time of the place was also nesting dawn.\nUnder the slight reddish-orange hue of the drowning sun, the place looked even more cozy and best for a date.\nLuna, upon seeing Austin's reaction, smiled heartily as she felt satisfied with inviting Austin to this place.\n\"Let's go. We aren't here just to stare, right?\"\nLuna dragged the dazed Austin, as the latter one responded in a flustered as he let himself get pulled by the cheerful Luna.\nThe people around had slightly foreign facial features, with most of them having the same raven hair, as they seemed to be busy in their business.\nSome were selling jewelry, some short weapons and other stuff. The smell of live barbecue, along with the richness of alcohol from the nearby bars, made the market quite engaging.\nAustin's earlobes sparkled for a second, before an artifact that helped him interpret language appeared in the shape of ear studs. The relic came with a non-visible device that allowed him to speak the language he would be hearing.\n\"I like them on you.\"\nLuna, upon seeing the black stud-designed Artifacts, commented with a shy smile, as the studs made Austin look really badass.\n\"Well, if it's like that, then I might get piercings real soon.\"\nLuna didn't comment on it, as a blush came up to her face before she heard Austin asking her.\n\"How did you find this epic place? I mean, I have gone to different markets while I was at my adventurer jobs, but those places majorly felt dull and lifeless.\"\nLuna inhaled deeply as she remembered something from the distant past before she replied in a longing tone.\n\"When I was a kid, I used to come here with my grandma. After I turned ten, we stopped hanging out. So you can say, it's been a long time since I came here. And I am glad you are the person I returned to this place with.\"\nSeeing her slightly sorrowful smile mixed with genuine satisfaction, Austin became lost with words as he stared at Luna's face for quite some moments.\nIt wasn't the first time Austin heard Luna mentioning her grandma, and seeing her current expression; he really wanted to ask about her.\nBut considering the place and time, he felt it would be better to take things slow as it seemed this person(grandma) matters a lot to Luna.\nSqueezing her hand slightly, Austin also smiled back as he muttered sweetly under his breath.\n\"Thank you for bringing me here.\"\nSoon the duo, who, despite being dyed in the native shade of the place, was gathering quite a lot of attention, started strolling around the area.\nEnjoying the delicacies and buying some random things once in a while, Luna and Austin proceeded to the market, before suddenly, Austin's feet came to an abrupt halt as he saw a specific store around the corner.\n\"Eh?

      "content": "\"Eh? What happened, Austin?\"\nStaring at a strange store that Luna had never seen when she came here in the past, Austin made a face like he just has seen ghosts wandering in daylight.\nBut not only that, his expression spoke more than his stutters, much to Luna's astonishment and slight worry.\n\"L-Luna...that place...!\"\nNow Luna was becoming extremely worried by these short glimpses of the main thing as she cupped Austin's face suddenly before pointing his eyes toward her.\nAustin became flustered as the shocking scenery changed into a beautiful sight; as he saw, the worries blended with an annoyed expression of his date, which made him realize how dazed he was.\n\"Tell me what it is, before I freak out.\"\nHer intent gaze made Austin slightly amused, but he definitely wouldn't say it.\nPlacing his hand on hers, which was cupping his cheeks, Austin returned to his usual self as, with a smile, he whispered softly.\n\"It's nothing to worry about. Just the store is named after something which belongs to my previous world. That's why I fell into a stupor.\"\nLuna wasn't aware of Austin's whole past as she had frames of his memory and had only focused on significant events.\nHer eyes went wide, when she came to realize that the place which made Austin so shocked actually was related to his previous world, which made Luna slightly excited, too, as she dearly wanted to know about the things associated with Austin.\nTurning his eyes, Austin again saw the giant board which had written the store name in his native language, but in the corner of the store board, there was Kanji dialect, too, signifying the origin of its owner.\n\"Should we check it out?\"\nAustin asked hopefully, as he really wanted to check the store. More than knowing about the eatery's owner, he was more tempted by the food he had been missing for more than 15 years now.\nLuna was more than thrilled to know about the place, so without waiting, she nodded with sparkly eyes as the duo walked toward the store.\n**TRING**\n\"Irrashaimase~\"\nA bell rang as they walked in the store before Austin's ear received something damn nostalgic as he heard a feminine voice probably belonging to the store manager.\nTurning his head, he saw a woman in her early twenties busily preparing ramen in the kitchen as the customers placed orders one after another.\nThe whole store was almost filled with various customers enjoying the delicacies, which made Austin's mind fuzzy, before homesickness got him hard.\nThe servers and even the chef who greeted them in Japanese were interacting with the customer in the native language of this place, which made him complicated, but he didn't ponder upon it much as he saw a waitress approaching them.\n\"Can I show you guys a table?\"\n\"Yes, please.\"\nIt was Luna who replied with a smile as she knew Austin wouldn't be speaking anytime soon because of the whirlwind of emotions she was sensing from him.\nThe waitress, upon receiving such a gentle smile, blushed slightly as, in a fluster, she turned on her heel before she muttered in a shaky voice.\n\"P-please follow me.\"\nThe table, which the midget waitress led to the couple, was placed in a corner that was slightly secluded and gave a sense of pleasant atmosphere.\nThe wooden table, along with the serene lightning, gave a vintage blended with romantic taste as the couple occupied the seats and sat while facing each other.\nThe waitress gawked both at Austin and Luna from time to time as the slight blush never left her cheeks. And the reaction was justified since the pair of a handsome man and an otherworldly beauty weren't commonly spotted around the town.\n\"What would you like to order?\"\nThe waitress asked in a slight meek tone as she held a notepad in her hand.\n\"You take charge, master.\"\nLuna spoke in a defeated tone, as she had no idea what was being served here.\nBut little did she realize that her casual remark to Austin would leave a significant misunderstanding with the midget waitress.\n'She's enslaved?! Isn't she so beautiful? I wonder what price this man has paid for her.'\n\"Um...two miso ramen and a side serving of your taste. Thank you.\"\nAustin smiled at the end of his words, much to the waitress' limit, as she nodded and, without even noting the order, darted away.\nAustin blinked perplexedly at the disappearing sight of the slightly younger-looking woman, before he heard Luna's voice.\n\"So, is that chef from your previous world?\"\nAs Luna said, she cast a barrier around them in case of being eavesdropped as she heard Austin replying in an affirming tone.\n\"Yeah, it seems that's the case. The way she greeted us and coupled with the dishes this restaurant serves, I am now sure that this place is related to my real world.\"\nLuna, who was hearing his words, suddenly halted her movement before she blinked toward Austin.\nHer aura suddenly turned dark as her hand slowly made its way on top of Austin, surprising the latter mentioned.\n\"Luna?\"\n\"Austin...isn't this your originality now? Why are you still saying that place as your real world when you belong here?\"\nThere was a slight smile on her face, but Austin knew she wasn't smiling at all.\nAustin, in an instant, sensed her unsettled thoughts before he expressed a loving smile before holding her hand in a warm hold.\n\"I know, Luna, that I belong here. It's just that, my life being so perfect with you, makes me think that this life is still a dream which might break at any moment.\"\nLuna's expression softened drastically as a blush lit up her face. Austin sighed inwardly as he concluded that it was almost impossible to understand Luna's mood swings, which led him no choice but to use flowery words sometimes.\n\"I-Is that so. Then it's okay.\"\nShaking his head in defeat, Austin saw the fidgety Luna, who was stealing gazes because of her blush.\nSoon their order was served with two big bowls of ramen and some cucumber and chili salad. The nostalgic smell of the ramen made Austin already full for the day, before he saw something out of place beside the bowl.\n\"Umm...are only forks available to eat ramen?\"\nAustin wasn't sure whether using the direct word would be good, so he just asked subjectively.\nThe maid's face instantly brightened up as she shook her head in an instant.\n\"No sir, we have another culinary which madam has invented along with these peculiar noodles. Since nobody knows about it, we generally provide a fork with ramen. Should I get it for you, sir?\"\nAustin nodded as he replied, \"Please.\"\nBut before the waitress could have dashed away, Luna suddenly spoke up.\n\"Please bring two, whatever you are talking about.\"\nThe waitress blinked for a couple of seconds before she nodded and walked away.\n\"What?\"\nSensing Austin's amused gaze, Luna asked with a slight frown as she hid her embarrassment behind her tone.\n\"Nothing~\"\nAnd to add fuel to the fire, Austin giggled at the end of his words, much to Luna's annoyance upon how she behaved right now.\nThe waitress didn't make the unique customers wait more than a minute before she brought two pairs of wooden chopsticks toward the table.\n\"Please enjoy your meal.\"\nSaying so, the waitress left the two alone as the couple continued their date with an unexpected turn of events.\n\"Should I help you, Luna?\"\nAustin was thoroughly amused by the site of the clumsy saint who was trying hard to intimate him but failing miserably.\n\"Please do.\"\nLuna sighed as she accepted her defeat before she saw Austin blowing over the ramen, which was stuck between his chopsticks, with a smile not leaving his face at all.\nLuna pouted about being made fun of before she saw the chopstick being extended towards\nher.\n\"Here. Enjoy plentiful~.\"\n\"Hmph!\"\nGrumbling, Luna extended herself forward a little before her small mouth received the noodle as she tucked her hair behind her ear to avoid disturbance.\nThe casual gesture of Luna made Austin mesmerized for a long time that, even though Luna slurped the serving, his hand was still frozen on his spot.\nLuna blinked upon seeing Austin's dazed look before she raised her brows in query.\n\"You are beautiful.\"\n**Cough**Cough**\nLuna instantly coughed upon being attacked suddenly as she glared with teary eyes towards the unfair man.\nAustin extended water with an apologetic smile on his face.\n\"Don't come at me so suddenly. It's bad for my heart.\"\n\"Hai....hai.\"\nFor the rest of the next twenty minutes, the duo enjoyed their couple time as Austin lovingly fed Luna and also ate the delicious ramen while chatting casually.\nIt was only after they finished, and the waitress cleaned the table, that Austin requested something out of nowhere.\n\"Can you pass this to your madam?\"\nWhat he extended was a tissue paper on which he had written something before. The waitress, despite being flustered, nodded as she went away in a daze.\nLuna raised her brows in perplexion as Austin replied in a calm tone.\n\"Wait for a few seconds.\"\nLuna was still unsure about the situation, but soon her eyes sparkled in alertness.\nAs Austin said, a presence darted toward them at a pace that made Luna nearly activate her spell.\nAppearing while panting heavily was the chef who was preparing dishes by the counter as she raised her voice in a hurried tone.\n\"You...!\"\n____________________\nA/N:- Next chapter...big revelation.\nEditor : Zenon #4120",

      "content": "\"You! Who's the one who wrote that compliment?!\"\nAs her words flew in a very clear path even though she was panting heavily, the long raven-haired woman asked the couple sitting quietly at their table.\nHer voice contained anxiety along with some hopefulness as she studied Austin and Luna, turn by turn in such less time before she heard the boy speaking in a calm tone.\n\"It was me, owner-san. And again, the ramen was really perfect to our liking. Please keep up the good job.\"\nAustin compliments honestly, as he saw the woman smiling gleefully before she shakes her head, probably realizing that she was getting diverted from her primary focus.\n\"That would be for later but are you really not from this world? Though, you look like a foreigner, but your face doesn't seem to be Asian?\"\n(A/N:- Austin wrote that compliment in Kansai)\nSubconsciously or not, the woman was speaking in Japanese, which the artifact wasn't interpreting since Austin was utterly familiar with the language.\n\"First, can you tell me about you? How did you come here?\"\nAustin decided to talk in his native language since he didn't want to leave Luna out of the conversation.\nIt seemed the woman also sensed something off with Luna's expression when she asked Austin about his origin; that's why her following words came out in the town's language too.\n\"I will tell you, but is it okay to continue the chat elsewhere? You see, both of you are already grabbing a lot of attention, and if I, too, start conversing with you even though we have this barrier, I might get a summoning command in the court.\"\nThere was a lot that made Austin frown. Like at the conclusion when she said that she might get a summoning issued, or the attention-grabbing part.\nBut it wasn't him who spoke first; instead, the saint who was sitting quietly until now.\n\"You can see my barrier?!\"\nLuna nearly shouted as the statement that the shop owner released was too unreal for her to believe.\nA mage's ego was what it called, which ignited inside Luna as she asked for an explanation of how her such high-level spell was seen through.\nThe woman smiled awkwardly as she heard Luna's expression of her disbelief upon the thing which most of the mages felt around her.\n\"Well, it's not like your spell has a fault, miss. Instead, I would say it's the most beautiful and flawless barrier I have ever seen. But unluckily, you met me, an irregular appraiser who can see right through almost every spell and trap.\"\nLuna blinked in slight perplexion as she heard the woman's words as her anxious mind calmed down a bit.\nLuna's slightly exaggerated reaction was justifiable as it was the first time anyone was able to breach her barrier. Not even Austin could see through Luna's spell, which made him realize what kind of anomaly this unexpected existence was.\n__________________________\nThe trio soon left the table and the restaurant entirely as the woman in her mid-twenties led the duo to her room which was on the second floor of the complex.\nIt seemed she ran a motel too, as there were quite a number of people on the second floor, as they made their way toward the very end of the corridor, which was the most secluded.\n\"I know it isn't very great, but please make yourself comfortable.\"\nThe room in which the lady brought the couple in was pretty big if compared to the inn that Austin rented back in his adventurer days.\nThere wasn't any decoration, just a single bed, a small coffee table, and a simple wooden wardrobe along with some small furniture like a stool, etc.\nInviting them both toward the table, the owner of the room brought a stool from beside her bed before she sat with her eyes roaming in between them.\n\"You guys seriously compliment each other, now when I take a closer look.\"\nAn insuppressible smile erupted on the quiet saint's face as she fought the urge to grin gleefully.\nAustin just smiled while scratching his cheek in embarrassment as the woman giggled in satisfaction from their reaction.\n\"So, who are you, if you don't mind me asking?\"\nThe woman asked as she twirled her finger before the pot resting on the shelf by the coffee table suddenly levitated toward them as it also started heating up.\nNeither of the two missed such a high level of psychokinesis as Austin responded while keeping his gaze straight.\n\"I am Austin, and she is Luna. We aren't natives of this town, as you can guess. And if it's about me knowing Japanese, then I would rather hear you out first.\"\nAustin spoke in a serene tone as he saw the woman blinking a couple of times as she became perplexed.\nFor the next few minutes, only the small whistle of the kettle resonated in the room, as it seemed the woman was contemplating upon something.\nAustin understood her insecurity as, just like her, no one would give away the information about being a reincarnate just like that.\nBut little did he expect that, unlike him, the woman in front would not be a reincarnated being but...\n\"Okay, first, let me introduce myself.\"\nSpeaking in a neutral tone, the woman poured the content, which smelt like lemon tea, as she continued.\n\"I am Shirata Akiko as in 'Autumn child'. I am 43 this year and currently working as the manager and owner of this eatery and motel.\"\nAustin raised his eyebrows as he heard Akiko's actual age but again, he couldn't expect less from someone who carries mana in them. Just like his mother.\nThe two took the cup, which Akiko extended toward them as she continued.\n\"Now, as per how I came here...then I was summoned here through a magic portal.\"\nThe eyes of both listeners went wide as they glanced at each other for a second before focusing their eyes back on Akiko.\nSummoning to a different world was a mere myth written in an ancient fairy tail; that's why Luna's reaction felt justified.\nBut what made Austin flabbergasted was something he could not speak as if now....\nSensing the mixed reaction, Akiko continued.\n\"About a year ago, I, along with three others, were transported to this world through a cross-dimension teleportation portal. The summoning was something incredibly new to me, but the two of the guys among us four reacted like it was something they awaited or they were aware of.\"\nThe expression on Austin's face changed significantly as he heard Akiko's words which seemed genuine enough.\nThe way she has been saying things, it became clear to Austin that the two summoned beings were aware of this generic isekai troupe, or maybe there was something more.\nBut despite his curiosity growing over the bay, he stayed silent and let the lady continue.\n\"Since I wasn't interested in the heroic stuff, I left the royal palace and started the business which I always dreamt of in my last life.\"\nThere was a sense of pride and satisfaction in her eyes as she muttered how fulfilled she was in this life of hers.\nAustin smiled as he was also happy about Akiko's achievement, whereas Luna just sipped on her tea which she found strangely addictive.\n**Sip**\n\"What about the other three? Are they adventuring, or have they also started something independently?\"\nAustin asked as he thought it would be good if he could meet some people who share the exact origin as him.\n\"Hmm...as I remember, the stout boy from the group left to build his harem while adventuring around the nation. And about the other two, then the spiky-haired boy is pursuing the hero girl who was summoned alongside us. But as I remember, his chance with that stern and overpowered girl is close to zero.\"\nAkiko rubbed her chin as it seemed it had been a long since she had left the people she came here with.\nSuddenly it seemed Austin realized something as he asked with a slight perplexion.\n\"Akiko-san...is this girl which you said is a hero...Is it just by name, or does she have a class of hero?\"\nThis was a rather complex question as a class of hero was extremely rare, or to say it was nearly impossible for someone randomly to be bestowed with the blessing of becoming a Hero.\nThis was the reason why Kyouki was so famous across the nation, as he was the only being born in the past two centuries who received the title of hero because of the Blessing he received from the supreme deity.\n\"It's neither her class nor just in the name. What makes her a hero is a strength she carries. I know I shouldn't tell you guys, but do you want to know what class the first time she got appraised with?\"\nUpon hearing such a deep tone, even Luna became interested as both nodded simultaneously toward the woman before a shocking reservation was brought forward.\nAkiko smiled with a sigh as she leaned back on her chair before only a two-syllable word left her mouth.\n\"Demi-god.\"\n______________________\nA/N:- Here comes a new char. I hope you guys like it, and don't worry; Austin wouldn't be nerfed since everything has a limit...kekek…\nEditor : Zenon #4120",

      "content": "\"Are you sure it's Demi-God and not something else?\"\nAustin was a little startled upon hearing Luna's calm tone as he didn't expect her to question the credibility of the word; rather, he thought whether surpassing a Hero Class and entering the domain of Gods was even possible?\nFrom what he has learned and seen in the manga, the hero class was sufficient for Kyouki to defeat the Demon Lord. Although it took a lot from the human side to let Kyouki face the Monarch of Darkness, in the end, a hero was destined to slay evil beings.\nAnd since the main motive of a hero was to eradicate the demon lord, Kyouki never grew stronger than he already was at the end of the manga.\nAnd now, suddenly, this strange woman with a strange background brought a class that was unheard of until now, and not only that, this class was already granted to someone who still wasn't known to the world.\n'Is it a secret weapon or something more...?'\nAustin was sure that this summoned hero was kept secret from others as a hero surpassing the Light of Humanity, Kyouki, would become the piece of the world's attraction within a night.\nBut for Austin, it would not be good. His system recognizes Kyouki as a hero and gives Austin points in accordance with the hero's involvement. What if, the center of focus changes to the new summoned hero and some alteration happens to Villain's System Points Requirement?\nIt was fortunate that Austin just had to care about his system for this week on a necessity basis. After that, he doesn't care whatever happens.\nAkiko, upon hearing Luna's profound query, smiled before she sighed in defeat.\n\"I haven't seen it myself, but the level of strength and the peculiar mana she carries, is still the most terrifying thing I have ever appraised.\"\nLuna nodded indifferently as it seemed she wasn't much entertained by the answer. What was going through her mind when she heard the existence of a human with demi-god potential, was something she only knew.\nHowever, on the other hand, Austin has his other worries.\n\"This person...is she interested in being a hero in the future?\"\nIf things were to change on a scale that he never had thought before, then there were various things Austin needed to prepare in order to keep his life with Luna peaceful in times of possible future events.\n\"I don't know her intentions as she only spoke, I guess, two or three times to me or anyone else. As I said, she is quite a stern and cold-headed beauty. But there is something which makes me believe that in the future she will shine brighter than anyone.\"\nLuna, who had already lost interest in the topic of any random existence, just took the kettle and helped herself with another serving. Although she pretended to be uncaring, she was thoroughly studying the fluctuating emotions from Austin.\nAnd she didn't have a good feeling about it...\n\"And what is it Akiko-san?\"\nAustin asked as his curiosity grew even more.\nAkiko knew she shouldn't be telling these many secrets about what was happening behind the castle doors, but in the end, she was a woman who loved gossiping.\nShe conceded.\n\"If there is someone I have seen being the most diligent and hardworking despite being strong enough to annihilate hundreds of Terror Demon, then it would be that girl. People think she is working hard so she could counter the demon lord in the future but I believe there is something more to her interest. What my eyes tell, that girl isn't here to help humanity or something like that but to pursue something or someone by becoming strong enough, so she doesn't get restrained.\"\n______________________\n\"Austin.\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nAfter having some more casual chatting, Luna and Austin left the place before the night sky greeted them both.\nThe atmosphere already has taken a prettier shade as the stars enveloped the sky like a beautiful blanket.\nWalking hand in hand, Luna asked in a slightly anxious tone; even her face seemed to not care about the thing she was going to ask.\n\"When you heard about the hero summoning, you thought about your sister, right?\"\nAustin's mind froze for a second as he halted his feet, naturally bringing a stoppage for Luna, too, as she casually looked at him.\nSince they were walking on the sidelines and the market wasn't busy as it was in the evening, they didn't bring much attention to them.\nAustin was about to ask how she knew about it, but soon he realized that it was useless as if they were now; nothing was left for him to keep hidden from her.\nSighing in defeat, he continued their steps as he confessed the thought that first came to his mind when he heard about the possibility of bringing people from another world.\n\"Yeah, I thought about her. But soon, even before Akiko-san told us about the impossibility of re-summoning, I concluded it wouldn't be good for me to bring her here.\"\nLuna wanted to believe him, but when it came to the person whom Austin holds dearest to his heart, she just couldn't refrain from asking.\n\"Even though you love her so much, you still won't look for ways to bring her here?\"\nLuna was sure that she would do her best to stop any possibility of summoning Austin's sister to the world where Luna had already claimed Austin all for herself. But she wanted to know his thoughts.\nShe knew Austin's answer would break her heart, and she was prepared for it. But little did she expected that Austin would respond to Luna's anxiety in such a manner.\n\"Well, even if I get the chance to summon her, I won't do that. First, I don't want to pull her into a place where these many dangers are roaming. And second...\"\nSaying so, he halted their steps as he turned himself toward Luna, making the latter quite flustered.\nTucking her free fallen hair strand behind her ear, Austin held her cheek as, while directing his gentle gaze onto her, he whispered his honest thoughts.\n\"...I don't want the love I hold for you to be divided. She indeed is a precious person to me, but you, Luna. You are and will be the only one whom I can love, and this fact won't change, whatever happens.\"\n(A/N:- Flag?)\n_______________________\nA/N : Austin is aware of his good sister's feelings toward him.

Keep that form, and you will leap in your swordsmanship even without the use of mana\".\nThe one who was currently instructing the hero was an elderly man in his late sixties, or so did he seem.\nThe man came here upon the request of his granddaughter, Sicily, to train the hero Kyouki for some 'certain' unexpected purposes.\nSince the old man, Hachi, didn't have any objection to teaching such a fine young man who happened to be a hero too, the old man teleported here from a faraway place and initiated the training.\nAfter sparring with Kyouki and identifying his flaws, the old man used his experience to instill some of the stances and ancient techniques in the hero so he could stay standing in the long run.\nSince Hachi wasn't much proficient with mana, he doesn't train using magical enhancement to his technique, thus teaching Kyouki too, how he should handle things if somehow mana disappears from the world.\nCurrently, Kyouki's upper body was completely exposed, which showed a lot of cuts and bruises, which he felt like a trophy to adorn.\nThere were quite a number of women and some faculties who came to sneak on Kyouki and enjoy the scene, which in normal circumstances, they couldn't.\nThe party members of Kyouki were also training on their own weaknesses and sharpening their strengths with the help of Rachael and headmaster Merlin.\nBack on the grassy field, the black eyes of the hero, despite looking determined and concentrated on his training, his mind was not focused at all.\n'I can't sense either of them....'\nKyouki, after returning from the northern empire, seems to be distant from Luna, but in reality, he still cares for her.\nDuring his stay in the foreign lands, he realized that Austin wasn't using any dirt to keep Luna by his side. Even he hates to admit; he has seen how much love Luna carries for the blond youth.\nHe wasn't a shameless bastard to keep meddling in their business when their love was consensual, but he just couldn't move forward from the love he had nurtured for more than half a year.\nIt was Kyouki's first love after all....\n'Will my hard work make any difference, Luna? Will you ever look at me again?'\nHe was in a daze as his body moved subconsciously. It wasn't the first time, he got lost in his imaginary lane where only ruled a single woman, but he didn't let it show in front of his other party members.\nEven steadily, Kyouki has started to realize what kind of emotion his party members carry for him. And he knows better than anyone what it feels like if the person you love loves someone else.\nKyouki wouldn't stop loving Luna. He can't. But he would do all to reciprocate the emotions that his party members have been nurturing for him.\n'Maybe that way, you might find me worthy...'\nSuddenly his train of thoughts and the movement of his blade came to a halt, which naturally attracted the old man's attention too.\n\"What happened, boy?\"\nFrom the look on Hero's face, it seemed something grave had just taken place as he slowly turned his body in an aimless direction.\n**SWISSSH**\nLike a gust of wind, Sicily arrived just beside Kyouki with a worried expression spread across her flawless face as she called out for him.\n\"Kyou-kun...did you feel it..?\"\nHer heart was racing to the point she completely ignored her grandfather. The anxiety blended with a glimpse of fear made quite an amount of ripples in her usual calm mind.\nKyouki looked at the distant sky while judging a lot of things, and from what he sensed, even he became a lot anxious.\n\"Yeah. The front line has been ambushed. I can feel the dense miasma and the evil intent from this far. Sicily!\"\n\"H-Hai!\"\nBeing called so suddenly, Sicily stood straight as she replied in a fluster.\n\"Gather the others and tell them about the situation. Since headmaster Merlin must have also sensed the danger, he would take care of the school fortification. So we better do what we can. \"\nSicily nodded with a profound expression before she chanted a spell underneath her.\n\"I will meet you at the front gate, Kyou-kun. Please be safe.\"\n\"Mm. I will, Sicily.\"\nSmiling reassuringly, Kyouki saw Sicily drifting away as he heard the hoarse voice of the man beside him.\n\"You better not make my granddaughter cry, or I will hunt you down by all means.\"\nWithout turning toward the voice, Kyouki kept his gaze in the direction Sicily left as he muttered under his breath.\n\"I promise.\"\n____________________________\n\"Has everyone assembled?\"\n\"Yes, Commander!\"\nRachael nodded upon hearing the report as he focused his gaze toward the northern forest while standing on the fort wall of the Eden Academy.\n\"Do we have that many soldiers to cover the whole perimeter?\"\nKyouki asked as he glanced around the vicinity.\n\"Well, we can't cover this humongous place which is slightly less inbuilt than the royal palace.  But yeah, we have eyes all around the school for any unexpected ambush.\"\nThe school was built with 25 kilometers of sq ft in dimension. The number of soldiers from the royal capital wasn't any less but providing utmost security in each corner was close to impossible until not every soldier from Gram gathered around the fort.\nThe northern side was under the watch of the hero's party with the amount of five hundred soldiers in hand. The Eastern side was being guarded by the explorer group along with the Headmaster, with the same number of soldiers as the Northern Vanguard.\nThe Northern and Eastern areas were the most critical sides of the school as the intent from the monsters was at its peak from those two cardinals.\n\"I just hope that the explorer group does-\"\nSuddenly Kyouki's words broke down abruptly as his eyes widened in utter shock.\nRachael also seemed to notice the same as Kyouki, as he also felt his heart going cold for several seconds as both men faced the front simultaneously.\n\"Kyouki-kun...is that what I am thinking?\"\nLilia, with a deep frown adorning her slight baby-like face, asked as she tugged meekly on Kyouki's sleeve.\nWith a resolute face, Kyouki nodded as he announced the scariest revelation, much to everyone's fret.\n\"The front line has been breached. I think it's time.\"\n_________________\nAmidst the chaos that spread among the masses who were standing to protect the Academy after they heard the news of front-line failure, two figures enjoyed the scene far above anyone's perception.\nThese two silhouettes, just from outer appearance, seemed inhuman, and adding the leakage of slight miasma, it became certain of what origin they belonged to.\n\"Waah~ How amusing is it to see the human preparing to counter something inevitable~.\"\nShivering in delight was an inhuman woman with a petite figure as she hugged her curvy body while staring at nothing but only the group of humans standing on the fort.\nHer blood-red eyes were staring intently at the human figure of a black-haired boy who was wearing golden armor all over his body and a great sword hanging on his back\n\"Don't take this lightly, Philia. That blond human boy and that Headmaster are dangerous beings.\"\nThe tall muscular undefined inhuman, spoke in a stern tone as he eyed the vicinity; as he failed to spot one of the humans the demon was wary of.\n\"Well, yeah, they are~ But without their blessings...\"\nAs the female demon said, a skull-shaped artifact appeared right in the center of her palm as she continued.\n\"...They are nothing more than ants who are destined to be trampled upon~\"\n________________________\nA/N:- Let the chaos commence\nEditor : Zenon #4120",

      "content": "\"Something feels wrong.\"\nAmidst strolling around the city with his lover's hand intimately being held by him, Austin suddenly muttered under his breath as his steps also came to a halt gradually.\nLuna, upon sensing the sudden change in her beloved's temperament, frowned slightly before her eyes glimmered strangely.\nThe cyan shine of her eyes only covered her gaze for a couple of seconds before a profound expression spread across her face, which didn't go unnoticed by Austin.\n\"Luna?\"\nHis question was unheard as Luna was already in the process of chanting a spell.\nSoon her eyes returned to normal before a magic circle drew around both of them, illuminating the dark street in the process.\n\"Austin....be prepared.\"\nThis was the last thing Austin heard before the teleportation took place.\nThe atmosphere around their perception turned completely white, which made Austin close his eyes abruptly.\n\"Huh?\"\nEven before he opened his eyes, he felt the hand that was clutching Luna fall down, signifying that the person beside him had just fallen.\nOpening his eyes in an instant, Austin saw something unbelievable. The person he believed to be the strongest was kneeling on the ground while panting heavily like she had lost all her vitality.\n\"Luna?!\"\nAustin, without caring about the distorted surrounding, knelt just before Luna as he supported her while trying to figure out what had just happened so suddenly.\nHe also did feel something was wrong, but to the extent that could throw even Luna into such a condition?\nHer body was trembling, with the natural redness of her face fading away. Austin was growing nervous, passing each second as he heard Luna's weak voice all of a sudden.\n\"T-There is somet-*cough*thing blocking the blessing of gods. *Hah* I am okay, Austin; just the lack of mana *huff* is making me dizzy. O-once you destroy the thing which is causing this change *cough*.\"\n\"Shh, It's okay. I got it.\"\nAustin held her body closely in his embrace as he concluded the unnatural feeling around him.\nTaking out a capsule-like thing from his inventory, Austin threw it on the ground, before the capsule emerged as a giant round globe.\nThe outer surface of the globe seemed to be made of something hard and unbreakable, with a blue and red light shining at the central belt.\nAustin got up with Luna in his arms before he tapped on the red light.\n**SWIIISSH**\nThe upper half of the globe instantly parted up before comfortable bedding with some necessities like water and food supplies appeared inside of it.\nAustin looked at the weak and trembling body of his most precious person, before he resolved himself and gently brought Luna over to the bed.\nThe capsule was one of the rewards he got from the system, which in general words, was a Survival Pod.\nThe globe has the capability to withstand any kind of atmosphere and condition and provide the resident with the best condition which they prefer. The supply of necessities was limitless inside, which ensured that the survivor could even spend their life inside of it.\nSince the open air didn't feel to be working well on Luna, Austin felt the capsule would be the best solution.\n\"Just wait for me here, Luna. I will solve this one real quick and come back to you before you wake up from your nap.\"\nDespite him acting hard, seeing Luna in such a miserable condition, his heart was clenching hard like never before. This wasn't the first time he was witnessing his beloved one in their worst, but this pain he was feeling currently was nothing compared to what he had experienced until now.\nGathering the last of her strength, Luna lifted her hand before Austin swiftly took it, not to let her exert any further strength.\nSmiling weakly, Luna muttered under her breath.\n\"I-Isn't it hilarious that I never get to help you at the m-most critical times...I-Is it destiny or god just hates the idea to let our happin..ess last long...\"\n\"Don't say something like that. You already have helped plenty enough. Now it's time for me to work and make my woman proud of my achievement. So don't think foolishly about destiny or god. Until I am here, I won't let anyone decide what we deserve.\"\nA beautiful smile spread across her lips as she nodded feebly. Before she could have lost consciousness, Austin hurriedly pulled back the cover of the globe to not let her suffer anymore.\nAustin kept his gaze on the globe for several seconds, thinking about the person who was just behind the surface before he somehow came back to himself.\nTurning on his heels, he took out five wooden dolls from his inventory before throwing them on the ground.\n**KRRRRR**\nSuddenly five humongous figures emerged out of nowhere with the appearance of faceless wooden demons. Despite their outer surface, each one of them was a veteran fighter of high rank.\nThese five were also the artifact that the system rewarded Austin in the past. Since he had never felt the need for bodyguards until now, he never considered touching them.\n\"Protect her.\"\nWithout any expectation of a response, Austin left the five dolls around the globe before he walked some distance away from them.\nTurning his front toward the five figures and one substantial black globe, Austin suddenly landed his palm on the ground before a magic circle of 200 meters was invoked around the place.\n**TREMBLE**\nThe ground shook violently as soon a cage of more than 400 meters in height emerged all around the five wooden dolls who were surrounding the capsule globe.\nThe cage was built with natural material but what Austin added from his inventory, made the cell stronger than ever before.\nAround ten long pieces of white paper, which had some Japanese calligraphy imprinted on it, appeared around Austin, hanging in mid-air and waiting to be planted.\nAustin, using his will, directed the ten pieces on the walls of the cage.\nThe calligraphy pieces were, in actuality, seals of spell negation. Any mana-originated attack would be suppressed even if the attack reaches up to Legend Rank.\nNext, he did was to use an invisible bubble barrier that had the capability to neutralize any kind of physical attack and also reflect them in a destructible manner.\n'I guess this would do...'\nAustin stared at the place cage for some minutes. Took his time to calm his raging heart, which urged him to forget all about the ongoing situation and take the capsule away from here.\nFinally, after more than a minute, he came back to himself before turning toward the place he was receiving such grave sensation for.\n'Wait for me, Luna.'\n______________________\n[5 minutes earlier]\n\"Commander Rachel! Help Kyouki and leave the things around here to us!!\"\nShouted at the top of her lungs was the supporter warrior mage, Sicily, as she used her battle axe to slay a Unique Grade Demon in one slash.\nDespite losing the blessing, the supporter warrior was able to keep up with the pace and help the front lines in holding the fort steady even though the ambush commenced more than 20 minutes ago.\nAfter the disappearance of blessings from the warrior, what was left was only the physical might of the warriors and the old ways of dealing with things.\n\"I will move at once!\"\nSaying so, Rachael, in a far worse condition than other soldiers, slayed a demon using his sword, before he looked for the presence of the hero.\n'The heck...!'\nRachael's body shivered as he finally got a glimpse of what was resisting the stampede of the monsters. The small number of demons that the lower line of defense, including Rachael, was handling were those demons who escaped from the front line.\nNow, who composed the front line when the majority of the hero's party and Royal Knights were on the lower line?\nOnly two people.\n\"Y-You hanging there, boy!!\"\nAsked in a loud, hoarse voice was a bald old man in his late sixties, as he swung his twin sabers and annihilated a pair of reptilian Unique Ranked demons in the process.\n\"Yeah...somehow!\"\nReplied in a fluster was the raven-haired handsome youth who currently had an enhanced body armor covering his whole body with a two-meter shield in hand and a longsword moving at a furious pace and eradicating various demons along with slashes.\nKyouki was thoroughly terrified, after witnessing the change in the air, which practically sucked the greatest strength of any mage, their blessing, out of them like suddenly Gods have pulled their hands off their worshiper.\nMages like Lilia and other conjurors from the Royal Capital, became completely powerless as their blessings were the only thing they majorly relied on.\nDespite having mana to evoke spells, without blessings, those spells would be like a slash of a blade but without sharpness at its edge. Blessings were the source that helps a chanter to enhance their spell and support in the redirection of its evocation.\nWithout such resourceful backing, the mages were only working as minor support to the front and back line by utilizing whatever they could under such unexpected circumstances.\n'Shit!'\nBeing a little diverted from his surroundings, Kyouki felt a massive blow landing on his back, which resulted in his front fall.\n\"Kyouki!!\"\nVanessa roared as she saw Kyouki getting overwhelmed by the number of demons, as his figure soon disappeared among the black and gray sea of anguish.\nBut despite wanting to rush toward his beloved, Venesssa was pushed back by a group of demons as she held her ground somehow.\nSicily and Lilia had similar intentions, but the lower line got overly crowded because of the fall of Kyouki, resulting in the failure of reinforcement to the hero.\nRachael, who saw such a scene, bit his lip in frustration for not being able to help Kyouki, but suddenly, his eyes went wide like something life-threatening had been picked up by his senses.\nTaking the minuscule of time in between his battles, he looked into the air before he muttered under his breath, which only he was able to hear.\n\"Something terrifying is incoming.\"\n______________________\nA/N:- Heroic entry of a Villain?\nThis war would take time, maybe like five chapters.

      "content": "\"Something terrifying is incoming.\"\nAs the whisper left Rachael's lips, a humongous amount of mana serged around the atmosphere, before a figure covered in flames rained down from the sky, attracting almost every gaze upon it.\nThe demons who were crowding over the place where Kyouki was a moment ago, were suddenly lit up by the silhouette as it landed right in the middle of it.\n**BOOOOOOOM**\nThe heavy blow that the strange flaming figure created upon landing at a furious pace shook the ground and made the air around the battlefield tremble at a violent rate.\nEvery eye was now focused on the place where the heavy cloud of dust emerged all of a sudden, as the demons too changed their projectile and started moving toward the explosion site, in greed of the mana which everyone felt from the burning figure.\nThe eyes of various people were wide open as the realization of the hero's death with that explosion, made them shocked beyond belief.\nBut the most shocked were the three beauties who had their eyes fixated on nothingness, as what they saw made their minds go numb.\n'Ky..ou..ki...'\nSicily dropped to the ground as she stared at the scene like her life had been cut off by that explosion. Beads of tears clouded her ruby eyes, as she felt her world collapsing right in front of her, but there wasn't anything she was able to do in order to stop it.\nBut as soon as the cloud of dust started to fade away, her world regained its color as she saw a spectacle that she might not have believed unless she wasn't witnessing it herself.\nThe one who appeared from the cloud of dust was a blonde youth with a stoic expression spread on his face as he supported the ragged yet alive body of the hero.\n\"It can't be...\"\n\"Is he Austin..?!\"\n\"Did he just save hero-sama?!\"\n\"Idiot! He saved all of us!\"\nThe demons around the two men were about two and a half dozen, which signified that the other demons who were suppressing Kyouki earlier had been vaporized entirely from existence. These still visible demons were those who rushed at them after hearing the explosion.\nNot only that, even the old man Hachi, was freed from his battle as he panted heavily while kneeling on the ground. The demons around him also disappeared like they never existed in the first place.\n'Is it even possible ..?'\nRachael's mouth was agape as he was the only stable mind who was able to perceive the situation entirely, and from what he concluded, he still wasn't able to recover from it.\nAustin soon disappeared from his site and appeared just beside Sicily, who was kneeling on the ground with some drop of tears still adorning her charming eyes. But these tears weren't of grief; instead, of relief.\nAustin didn't wait for much longer as he dropped Kyouki beside his girl, as he also pulled out something from the inventory.\n\"Sicily.\"\n\"Ah.\"\nShe was about to check on Kyouki's condition when suddenly the person, whom Sicily has very seldom conversed with, called out for her.\n\"Take these.\"\nSaying so, he threw five containers of potions toward Sicily, which the latter one caught somehow in her embrace before she saw something more coming out of thin air.\nSomething interesting.\n\"A-Austin, this..?\"\nHer eyes were continuously fixated on the mage staff, which Austin pulled out of the air. The magic wand, by outer appearance, had a brown stick with a black snake-like sculpture running around the shaft. There was a big eye that was dormant at the head of the staff with feathers connected on either side of the eye.\n\"This wand will help you draw your mana circles efficiently and boost your mana up to 30%. There is an additional feature that comes in handy when you run out of mana, so don't hold back and handle the front lines.\"\nWithout waiting for a response, Austin grounded the staff on the dusty surface as the staff stood straight.\nSicily, being flustered by the absurd amount of features, suddenly got called again by Austin as she stared at his back while he spoke.\n\"Get him up. I will need him real soon.\"\nWithout any further ado, Austin levitated slightly in the air before he launched away, leaving a speechless Sicily along with an unconscious Kyouki at their spot.\nThe next place Austin flew toward was a group of soldiers fighting side by side while trying to protect the small framed girl at their back. The sole female in the group was trying her best to enhance the soldiers using her mana but was failing each time awfully.\n**DHAK**\n**SWOOOSH**\nAs Austin landed on the ground, a deep amber-like flame erupted from his hand before he burnt every demon who was crowding the group of soldiers.\nIt only took less than half a minute for him to deal with around 30 demons with just a single attack, much to everyone's shock.\nLilia's eyes were wide open, too, not because of the attack but the person who had suddenly appeared.\n\"Regroup with Commander Rachael and help those who have been injured on the way. Now keep moving!\"\nHe commanded in an authoritative tone that no one dared to deny as they instantly joined their legs and saluted simultaneously.\n\"Sir, Yes, Sir!\"\nSaying so, the group of soldiers started marching toward the center of the battlefield, where stood the main force of the rear vanguard.\nLilia was also about to move, thinking the command was for her too, but suddenly when everyone left, Austin called for her.\n\"Lilia. Come here.\"\nBeing called like this when no one was around, even if it was a battlefield, made Lilia quite flustered as she meekly looked at Austin's very changed temperament.\nWalking slowly toward him, she saw Austin taking out something from thin air before a wooden stick appeared in his left hand.\n'Wait...that...'\nHer eyes glimmered strangely as she felt deep and profound energy leaking from the wand, which she felt to be inviting her as now her feet moved toward Austin, subconsciously.\n\"Take this and try to forget about the blessing for some time. Draw your mana as you used to draw before you were bestowed, and let this wand be the channel.\"\nLilia got out of her daze as she heard Austin's words, which contained a bit of their past. Before the time when Lilia and Austin weren't baptized in the church and received their blessings, Lilia often showed her proficiency with mana and enjoyed the praise which Austin showered on her.\nHearing him talk about those times, Lilia's mind drifted strangely as she stared at Austin's face for quite some moments in a stupor.\nIf it wasn't for Austin, she might not have gotten out anytime soon.\n\"Get out of your thoughts before you die.\"\nWithout waiting for her response, Austin handed the wand before he went away from the spot.\n\"Ah ...thank you for saving m..\"\nHer words slowed down, and at the end, her voice turned into a whisper as she stared toward the open air, which still gave her a sense of Austin's presence around her.\nThe last place where Austin landed was at the center of the rear line of the guarding units, which Venessa and Rachael had been handling until now before Austin arrived.\nJust using his overwhelming mana, Austin annihilated the demons like they were nothing but ants, on which he trampled without even noticing.\n\"You know, after seeing you overpowering them so easily, it kinda hurts.\"\nThe one who voiced his thoughts was the current on-ground commander Rachael as he felt sighing in amusement at his own foolishness to think how confidently he invited Austin to spar without holding back.\nNow he was thankful.\n\"Sir Rachael, how many soldiers are we left with?\"\nAustin asked without any intention of responding to Rachael's defeated reaction, as he saw the latter contemplating before answering.\n\"Around two hundred, more or less.\"\n\"Okay, then gather them at a place and protect the rear line as you were but with the help of these things .\"\nSaying so, Austin swung his arm before tens of potions and artifacts appeared on the ground, which made the spectator gasp in shock.\nThere were swords, daggers, shields, and other equipment too, which gave a strange kind of energy that no one had ever sensed before.\n\"Come on, grab them. We don't have all day to waste.\"\nAustin urged in a slight irritation as he felt everyone around him falling in a daze since earlier.\n\"Yeah, right. Hey, come here and help the injured one with the potions and...\"\nAs Rachael actively commanded the soldiers, Austin walked toward a specific warrior who had torn armor on her body which hid her natural charm. Her beautiful face was slightly pale from the battle she had faced in such a short amount of time.\nSeeing Austin's approach, Venessa straightened her back as genuine respect for Austin emerged out of her subconscious self.\n\"Throw that sword .\"\n\"Eh?\"\nBeing asked to throw her weapon was way out of what she expected as she stared at Austin in perplexion.\nOnly after he followed his words did Venessa realize why he asked to discard the blade.\n\"Without blessing, that sword is nothing but steel crap. Rather use this....\"\nSaying such, Austin pulled out something from his inventory which not only Venessa but everyone around them made freeze in a dead fret.\n\"A-A-Au-Austin...this...?\"\n__________________\nA/N:- Next chapter = Op moments.\nEditor : Zenon #4120",

      "content": "\"A-A-Au-Austin...this...?\"\nVanessa's eyes were at the point where they couldn't get stretched anymore as she saw the weapon Austin pulled out of nowhere.\nIt was a black metal composite sword that was lean at its base and broad as it reached its head. There were several conjunctions along the blade, showing the range it could whip.\nThe pommel of the hilt had a round strange runic engraving which gave the sword an ancient look. The handle of the strung connected weapon had a silvery white patterned grip which seemed comfortable to wield and easy to handle.\nThe reason why everyone, including Venessa, got startled upon witnessing the composite sword was the strange frightening mana it emitted and not to talk about its quirky design, which no one had seen until now.\nBut what followed was the terrifying thing they could have expected, witnessing from the blade.\n**CRACKLE**\nAustin swung the blade in a particular direction, which naturally separated each edge compartment and made the whip reach up to 30 meters from Austin. But the terrifying thing was the lightning which the sword gave out with the whip, destroyed the incoming demons in one blow.\nThe audience was so stunned by the overwhelming performance of the weapon that, for some moment, they forgot where they were. The smooth handling, the terrifying impact, and the beautiful lightning made everyone captivated by what they saw.\n\"Here, take this.\"\nAustin, who wasn't much habituated with swords, let go of the weapon without much care, but the receiver wasn't taking things so casually.\n\"W-wait...why me? You can have given this to Sir Rachael too.\"\nVanessa asked just on reflex as she was more concerned about her being not worthy of using such a divine and nightmarish sword.\nBut Austin's following words gave her a reality check, which she needed at a time like these.\n\"Don't get strange ideas. I just gave you that sword because I think you are the most flexible in getting accustomed to something new. So try to be useful.\"\nHis words, despite being a little rude, were still comforting, as hearing flowery words wasn't something Venessa liked. She better preferred this honest side of Austin.\nHe was arrogant in the past, and it's still the same as now, but the current Austin had the strength backing his arrogance which Venessa felt admirable.\n'Wait...what am I...'\nGetting out of her stupor, Venessa inhaled deeply. Nodding with her eyes focused on the blond youth, she gripped the handle of the sword and, with a light whip, made a crackling sound as her determined words followed behind.\n\"I will not let your support go in vain. Leave the responsibility of the rear line to us.\"\nAustin didn't have many doubts about Venessa's potential, so without thinking anything unnecessary, he nodded and activated Gravity Manipulation and flew away from the site.\nAfter reaching mid-air, Austin glanced around the battlefield to have a better view of the situation.\nBefore arriving at this vanguard side, Austin checked the Eastern flank where Headmaster Merlin, along with the Explorer group, was holding the fort somehow without many losses.\nThe headmaster was a mage who had been mastering his techniques for more than 50 years now. Abruptly getting the blessings snatched away threw the line of defense in a panic, but the professors and warriors weren't there merely for show.\nSince Austin felt that the ambush of the demons was far less than the forefront that Rachael led, he concluded it would be fine to leave the Eastern side on Principal and the others.\nThe demons from the forest started swarming again, and in some minutes, they would initiate their stampede towards the battalion.\nBut Austin's main focus wasn't on them. Instead, he was searching for the thing which caused the blessing to disappear so suddenly.\nAnd also, the fact that the blessing's absence made Luna so weak when Lilia and other mages weren't in such a bad shape made Austin troubled.\n'I better find the conjuror first.'\nThinking such, he glanced at the forest where a dense amount of heavy miasma suddenly approached towards the front. This curse energy Austin, as well as others sensed wasn't from the high crowd of Unique Ranked.\nIt was far more terrifying. Reeking with the chills of death, the miasma made everyone freeze in a fret as they stared towards the forest, completely ignoring the Unique Ranked demon who was approaching at a furious pace.\nIt wasn't that they were not wary of the swamp of demons; instead, the blood-draining sensation wasn't letting them feel anything else currently.\n**THUD**\n**THUD**\nThe heart of more than two hundred people sank as the figure of something ominous walked with heavy steps out of the darkness of the shadow.\nDue to the low sunlight, which was practically under the horizon, various low-ranking soldiers couldn't see what was incoming, but those who did saw, felt no better than the ignorants.\n**THUD**\nWith a final thud, the demons finally appeared in a clear vision before the miasma reached its peak point, making various soldiers drop to the ground because of dizziness and intolerance.\n**GRRRRRR**\nWhat growled with its fangs peeking out of its giant jaw was a humanoid demon with a size of more than three meters in height and a build which could even leave Charles miles behind.\nUnlike the other demons and monsters, these four entities had black and purple armor and vest cladded over their gargantuan body, with the face being the only visible part from normal perception.\nThe demons had almost identical features, with two big teeth protruding under their lower jaw and sharp needle-point fangs peeking out their mouth. In place of hair, the demon had live flames adorning their heads.\nTwo ruby eyes, which contained a glint of mortal danger, stared at the surroundings as if the human in front weren't worthy of their attention.\n**ROAAAAAAAARR**\nOne of the demons roared in frustration as it failed to find the source of mana which they felt some moments ago and was the reason why these identical demons, who were undoubtedly the strongest ones, appeared all of a sudden.\n\"A-are th-they Terror Ranks!?\"\n\"T-they definitely a-are! Can't yo-you feel that absurd energy!\"\n\"F-fuck! My legs are trembling.\"\nThere was an unhidden sign of fear among the human group as they caught a glimpse of such beings whom they could never in their wildest dreams have prepared to confront, even if they would have given a year or two.\nThe look on Venessa and Rachael's faces, who were the most befitting for the battlefield currently, wasn't good either, as they gulped their saliva in anxiety and evident fret.\nFeet started retreating, hearts began beating rapidly, and death seemingly felt nearer to their throat as they watched the demons roaring for unknown reasons.\n**Tap**\nSuddenly to the utmost relief of many, a figure landed on the ground with pure elegance as he stood between the two groups.\nRaising his left hand in mid-air, the ground underneath the stampede of Unique Ranked Demon started trembling.\n**CREAK**\nMore than five hundred demons who were just some meters apart from Austin, disappeared from the site as they fell into the pit which Austin created.\nWith his eyes focused on the Terror Ranked Demons, Austin drew strange infernos on the tip of his index finger before throwing it in the long pit.\n**SWOOOSH**\nLike a living hell which had descended on the surface, flames burnt every demon with such ferocity that the heavy cries even terrified the soldiers.\nWithout waiting for the flames to eat away the demons, Austin again raised his hand and covered the pit with stones that he created solely with his mana.\n(A/N:- Conjuror and Manipulator have a significant difference. Conjurors can create elements out of nowhere, but Manipulator can only control the existing elements. Well, Austin can do both, so yeah.)\nStaring at the demons who were looking at him like they had found their prey, at last, Austin didn't give any kind of reaction.\nFor him, every demon in front might be the reason for Luna's miserable condition, so he wasn't going to let any single demon live on his watch.\nAs if now, he didn't have the system or the Villain's point in mind. The surroundings or the people watching him with varied expressions, he cared about none.\nWhat he wanted was the remedy for Luna's discomfort, and if it could only be brought through annihilation and chaos, then he wouldn't hesitate to show this world what a true nightmare looks like.\n____________________\nA/N:- Well, if you think Austin wasted his artifacts on others, then you are in for a surprise since he has hundreds of those things dusting in his inventory.\nAnyway, if you like chaos, then you might love the next one.\nEditor : Zenon #4120",

      "content": "The sun was already drowned beyond the horizon, but the sky was strangely not dark enough to block an ordinary perception.\nDusty wind flew furiously, blanketing the atmosphere and giving an ominous vibe just by witnessing such an unnatural sight.\nOn a bloody battleground which was not so far from Eden's Academy stood quite an amount of figures currently in an attentive state.\nThe battalion of humanity that has been given the responsibility to guard the Northern front of the School has been staring at a scene with their eyes shrank in fret and hearts trembling passing each second.\nAmong these crowds, there were some people too who had their resolve still strong enough that they had their weapons pointed toward the threat in case the first line of defense falls out.\nThe front line of defense basically consisted of a single human who had the guts to face four Terror Rank demons without showing any kind of particular reaction at all.\nHis eyes, devoid of any emotion, stared at the identical inhumans as he patiently waited for them to take the initiative, like he was judging their worth.\nThe demons, despite being creatures who only pursued chaos and massacre, still develop some kind of reasoning after reaching a certain level.\nAnd the demons in front had been on the threshold of the third stage of Terror Rank for an unknown amount of time.\nBut despite having the ability to reason things and evaluate their opponent, Austin's attitude toward them, made the chaos seekers furious beyond tolerance.\nThey were here to hunt humans. The beings which the intelligence-carrying demon, considers nothing but a source of raw mana and object to trample upon.\nAnd one of those humans was mocking them like they were some lowly presence?!\nUnacceptable.\nCommunicating among themselves using telepathy, one of the demons, which was on the right most of the group, started marching forward, much to the human group's dread.\nVanessa's grip on the composite sword tightened as she resolved to jump into battle; if things go west. Not only her, but Rachael and even Lilia had a determined look that expressed their willingness to help Austin if the need arose.\nHowever, no one expected what would happen a minute from now...\nThe demon, which had raven flames adorned as a crown on its head, just like his brothers, walked with hefty steps toward Austin without any care about those in the background.\n(A/N:- Remember. Demon= It)\nIts heavy steps made the ground tremble as it approached the blonde youth with a wide grin plastered on its horrifying face.\n**THUD**THUD**\nUpon reaching approximately, 5ft apart from Austin, the demon finally halted its feet.\nAustin's eyes were still fixated on his front like he was seeing through the demon, or to say Austin didn't actually pay any heed to the nearby existence, since his target was someone else.\nNot being able to draw any reaction from the human, even if it was bringing out its miasma to the maximum, the demon roared in agitation.\n\"GRRRRRRRRRROORRRR\"\nAlong with the mighty roar, which made various people from the human side cover their ears in pain, the demon lifted its left arm higher than its height and, with lightning swiftness, pulled it down toward Austin's skull.\n**DHAK**\nThose who saw the hand of the demon falling over Austin, closed their eyes in fear of seeing something gory but little did they expect that Austin would counter the attack so casually.\n\"GRR?!\"\nThe demon felt its arm being clutched in an unbreakable grip before it could have landed on its destination.\nPerplexion spread across its face, as the demon tried to snatch its arm from the human's grip but failed to do so.\nLanding its feet on the ground heavily, the demon applied all its strength on the arm to pull it away from the unnatural hold but to no avail. And more to it, from Austin's expression, it seemed he wasn't even putting his strength at all.\n\"ERRGGGGG!!!\"\nUsing its other arm, the demon applied the very last ounce of his strength; as it let out a struggling voice while pulling itself from Austin like it was stuck in an ice pillar of thousand ages.\nCraters started forming around its feet, with the raven flames dancing wildly on the demon's crown. The struggle made the other three demons, and the human side flabbergasted upon witnessing the overwhelming might of the frail human.\nAustin wasn't able to tolerate the whining of the demon anymore, as he directed his gaze upon the demon just before he muttered under his breath.\n\"Annoying.\"\nLifting his left leg at a frightening speed, Austin kicked the abdomen of the demon without letting the other party counter the incoming blow at all!\n**BOOOM**\nThe blow was heavy enough to throw the demon meters away, but that wasn't the focus of the audience at all.\n\"Th-That...\"\n\"Buoog!!\"\n\"He tore it...Just like that...?\"\nBlood spurted out of the arm of the demon,  which Austin tore away with his blow.\nThe demon with wide eyes felt the numbing sensation spreading from its left side as it saw the human holding the arm that some seconds ago was attached to its body.\n**SWOOOSH**\nWithout letting the demon even growl properly, Austin burnt away the arm using the strange infernos, much to the Terror Demon's agony.\n\"UOOOOHHH!!\"\nThe demon roared in pain as it felt the burning sensation from its detached arm, but unfortunately, Austin intended not to let his ears go numb again.\nUsing gravity manipulation, Austin launched in an arc with the fallen demon as his destination. Clenching his fist tightly, Austin pushed himself mid-air using the skill [Indefinite Leap], and darted toward the demon like a small meteor.\nJust when he was about to get in contact with the gigantic body of the inhumane, Austin pulled back his punch and using half of his strength, landed his fist right at the center of the still dazed demon.\n**BOOOOM**\nPurple thick fluid along with flesh and brain matter of the receiver of such a deadly frightening blow, scattered around the lifeless demon as it got eradicated with the heavy impact.\nSome people from the human side felt the urge to vomit right there and then as they saw the brutality of Austin, which was far worse than anything they had witnessed until now.\nEven Rachael, who was the most experienced warrior on the battlefield, cringed at such a sight where a teenage human was able to punch the life away of such a terrifying demon without hesitation at all.\nAustin, who was unbothered by the gore or the blood he was painted in, rose on his feet before directing his gaze toward the three remaining demons.\n\"Make me wait, and I will make your deaths more miserable than this one.\"\nHis voice, despite not being spoken aloud, reverberated on the battlefield clearly, which naturally landed on the demon's senses too.\nWithout taking the risk of assuming their enemy was weak, the three demons launched from different directions, with Austin as their target.\nSurrounding him within a couple of seconds, the three demons conjured flames from their crowns before parting their mouths at the same time.\nThe raven flames filled their mouths wide agape before the three identical demons launched their attack simultaneously.\nAustin had plenty of time to activate his spell and avoid the attack, and so he did. Naturally, he wasn't an idiot to take an attack head-on. Levitating in the air he saw the spot burning where he was standing a moment ago.\n[XXXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXX]\nUsing his spirit tongue, Austin gathered Water spirits around him, before manipulating the elements and creating an icy hue around his levitating figure.\nIt only took him three seconds to build his magic formation, and before the demons could have redirected their flames on Austin, the latter mentioned rained down his spiritual spell, mercilessly.\n\"Avalanche.\"\nSuddenly, an icy catastrophe descended on the surface and enveloped the part of the land where the three baffled demons were standing with their mouths agape, not because of their flames but in astonishment.\n**SWOON**\nWith a serene sound, the heavy snow poured down like an endless stream, freezing everything around the diameter of a hundred meters.\nThe human faction also felt the growing chill from the attack which Austin conjured as they witnessed the sight converting into white paradise in less than twenty seconds.\nAustin halted his attack not so long after since he sensed the fading curse energy from the triplets.\nTurning his gaze toward the forest, Austin sensed the sign of strange miasma he was feeling some minutes ago disappearing, which brought a frown to his stained face.\nBut he didn't have the time to ponder since there was a massive army of demons comprising both Terror and Unique Rank approaching the battlefield.\nSighing heavily, Austin gathered mana on either hand, as he landed again in between humanity and inhumanity, as an unbreachable barrier.\n________________________\nAt the same time, when another massive battle between a horde of demons and a single human was about to flame, two figures landed at a particular sector inside Eden's Academy.\nThese two were the same demons who came to scout the battlefield and caused the sudden disappearance of blessings.\n\"Is she inside of that?\"\nThe female demon asked with a sneer as she stared at the large cage made of stone which had a peculiar globe inside of it.\n\"Yes, I am certain.\"\nThe male demon responded with utmost confidence as he also stared at the scene in front, which would change in just some moments.\nHearing her partner's remark, a wild grin spread across the female demon's face, revealing her sharp teeth as she muttered under her breath.\n\"Then let's get the reward we came here for~.\"\n_____________________\nA/N:- Drop a comment~\nEditor : Zenon #4130",

The way he asked in pure confusion seemed utterly adorable~\n\"Well, I got some power up, I guess.\"\nI hugged the staff to show my precious, what caused such a leap in my strength.\n\"What the fuck!? Is that Austin there!?\"\nWith his fingers trembling, my restless Kyou-kun pointed toward the front where the big war was undergoing.\nWell, Kyou-kun's reaction was legit since the scene in front could have made anyone shocked beyond belief. In that sense, his response felt a little underwhelming.\nThe spectacle, which I couldn't help but only sigh upon witnessing, was still giving me shivers even though I was pretty far from the scene.\nAustin, whom I seldom conversed with, in the past, considering his disgraceful and foul temperament, was showing such might, I haven't seen from anyone until now.\nCurrently, even being surrounded by hundreds of Unique Rank and tens of Terror Rank demons, Austin's eyes were still devoid of any emotions.\nEven though I believe my Kyou-kun is strong, I was sure that being surrounded by that many creatures, would have made him lose his will to fight at once.\nBut there, a person the same age as us was defeating the numbers which could have brought catastrophe not only to Eden's Academy but to the whole Gram Capital.\nI wasn't sure what caused such an attack, but I was thoroughly glad Austin was on our side; otherwise...\n**SLASH**\nSuddenly a slashing sound, came from my right as I hurriedly moved my staff toward it, only to find Kyou-kun fighting with a reptilian demon.\nI didn't help him since it might have hurt his ego. Instead, I hunted the other couple of demons who got away from Austin's line of defense.\nIt was me and Venessa who were working proactively in the rear section since others were either scared or had lost their strength to battle anymore.\nLilia was helping the injured with the potions, Austin had left us with. Strangely, the potion he gave us, differed from what I have seen until now.\nBut since there were already various mysteries about Austin piling one after another, I just treated it as a blessing of gods.\n\"How long was I out?\"\nTurning my head from the battlefield, I saw the complicated expression on Kyou-kun's face as he stared at the main battleground, which Austin was one-sidedly leading.\n\"Around ten minutes.\"\nI was very well aware of what Kyou-kun was thinking at the moment, but I didn't think it would be considerate of me mentioning it.\nKyou-kun's rivalry with Austin was due to the love he still carries from Luna, and looking at his rival being so dangerously powerful and overwhelming, I can somehow understand Kyou-kun's trouble.\nBut this wasn't something I could console him about. Since Kyou-kun couldn't move forward, he have to break the shell by himself.\nWe would be here to support him, but support couldn't make a person overcome his incompetence.\n\"Hmm?!\"\nSuddenly I felt a surge of energy from inside the school, which undoubtedly wasn't mana, but instead...\n\"Sicily. Lilia. Conjure a barrier, now!!\"\nMy ears received the shout of Austin, who still was around the battlefield, but unlike a moment ago, he was now levitating in mid-air.\nMy senses shouted to run away from that place as I sensed the terrifying accumulation of mana from Austin.\n\"Sicily-san, get out of your daze!!\"\nSurprisingly, Lilia approached my side even without me noticing as she shouted, which helped me get out of my stupor.\nExtending my hand, I chanted the spell of the best barrier I have learned from my father as I felt the support from Lilia, who was enhancing and strengthening the veil at a pretty furious pace.\nIt seemed what I was feeling from the battlefield was judged by others, too, as there was a pin drop silence from my rear.\nEven Kyou-kun had his mouth wide agape as he stared at the ascending figure of Austin.\nI don't know what made Austin use such a frightening spell, but whatever it was, I had a feeling it wouldn't end rather well for the demons.\n'I am pitying demons, now...?'\n_____________________\nGathering the most potent elemental spell on either hand, Austin took the help of the fire spirits, too, in order to enhance his attack to another level.\nWhile he was at it, Austin drew the power of the Infernus Lantern he had stored in his inventory and ignited the spell to brighten at a terrifying level.\nHis hands were covered in live and wild flames as he stared at the group of demons who had mutual feelings despite varying in class and intelligence, as they sensed the amount of mana gathering over their head.\nThe identical emotion which surged through all demons' consciousness was...\nFear.\nBut Austin didn't have the consideration, nor the time to let the creatures run for their lives.\n\"Sea of Flames!\"\nIn a little hurried manner, Austin didn't wait to let the mana complete his spell, as he directed the intense and overly absurd attack on the group of more than a thousand demons.\n**BOOOOOOM**\nA heavy explosion erupted from the place where the attack landed as soon the battlefield, along with a vast portion of the jungle, got covered in live fire.\nThe audience from the back felt sweat dripping endlessly down their forehead as they felt the heat from such petrifying waves of flame, even though the human side was about five meters away from the main battlefield.\nAustin's attack went on and on for more than a minute as the sea of flames enveloped the greenery and ate away whatever came along the waves.\nOnly after he felt that every single life signature have been erased did he halt his flames.\nMore than three kilometers of the northern jungle, along with the demons and low-rank monsters lurking around the forest, got annihilated, with most of them not even knowing what caused their death.\nThe ashy scenery in front didn't bother Austin as he was already in a rush to reach somewhere real quick.\nThe reason, why Austin went with the harsh way and ended the battle in such a manner,  was because he felt his barrier being breached, which had been drawn around Luna.\nHis heart had been in trouble since that moment, but he knew that leaving these many demons up to others would inevitably result in the worst way.\nLeaping in the air, Austin darted toward the place, where he had left his most precious person.\nFor some reason, he didn't have a good feeling about this whole situation which had been happening for some hours.\nAs some knots started connecting, he finally could see where Luna was, only to get shocked in the end.\n\"!!!\"\n__________________\nA/N:- Next chapter will conclude this arc.

      "content": "\"Woof! This barrier was one heck of overwhelming. I wonder how humans got their hands on such ancient ruins.\"\nSighed exaggeratedly was the male demon who came along with his partner to capture their target.\nIt goes without saying that the target they were aiming from the start and the reason why they left their soldiers leaderless amidst war, was none other than the Saint of Humanity, Luna.\nThe whole attack plan on the Gram borders and infiltration inside the perimeter with the help of an 'insider' was centered on the abduction, which was ongoing right now.\nThe male demon was the one, who used his terrorizing curse spell to break the barrier Austin had built around the black orb.\nIt took almost 70% of his miasma and around ten minutes to finally break through the first and second layers of defense.\nThe female demon helped with the wooden dolls, who lunged at the creatures just after the barrier was breached, which she handled somehow.\nFinally, after their prolonged hard work, which exceeded their expectation, the destination came into their view.\nThe strange black globe was floating in mid-air as the demon sighed simultaneously as the completion of their job seemed to not so far, however...\n\"You feel that?\"\n\"Hmm. Our soldiers are getting annihilated..?!\"\nThe female demon, who responded in a calm tone, ended with an exclamation as she sensed the absurd mana surge from the battleground along with the vanishing life signatures of her soldiers at an astonishing rate.\n\"T-They aren't getting annihilated...rather someone is massacring them..\"\nThe male demon felt chills of death reaching up to his throat as the scale of mana they both received was far from what they could have expected from someone from the human side.\n\"W-we should hurry up!\"\n\"But it's already too late.\"\nThe female demon, who was about to turn toward the black globe and take it away wholly with the person inside, halted her movements as she heard her partner's call.\nTurning her head in the direction where the male demon was eyeing, she felt cold water running down her whole body as she saw someone approaching toward them at a furious pace.\n\"Philia, you stand back. This one doesn't seem to be a talkative type.\"\nThe male demon grinned slightly as he gestured for Philia to step aside since the incoming human, just from the temperament, looked too aggressive even to have a word.\nAnd that's what the demon wanted too...\nPhilia, obediently nodded, and made space as a smirk also adorned her inhumane yet charming face. The reason why her demeanor was still non-wavering even though she sensed every soldier had disappeared from existence was simple ...\n'Facing off strength with Velak? I pity this human already~.'\nBut little did she expect that the end result would be something so unbelievably unexpected ...\n**BOOOOOOOOM**\nAt a terrifying pace, Austin shoots toward the male demon Valek before colliding his fist with the demon.\nThe blow was so frighteningly loud that the people on the battlefield, along with every student inside the main school building, heard its after effect.\nThe ground underneath the two trembled before a crater of 100 meters was formed with the colliding figures as its center.\nShock would be the emotion that mostly those who heard the reverberation of the clash, felt. But the female demon who was witnessing such sight felt herself in a greater astonishment than being merely shocked.\nThe partner she knew was a genuinely terrifying First Rank Terror Demon, whose physical might could even rival some of the Mythic Rank. But right now, he lost to a mere puny human boy?\n\"Khwakh!\"\nValek knelt on the ground just in front of Austin, as he felt his whole arm going numb due to the absence of any usable bone underneath the skin.\nIn just a single punch, the human, who by build was half of Valek, took away his high-grade armor along with his whole arm, and looking at the human's expression, it didn't seem, he felt a single ounce of pain out of it, at all!\n\"W-What are you...\"\nAsking with his voice slightly shaky was the aforementioned confident and egoistic demon who had his previous belief shattering just like his bones.\nAustin, without bothering to reply, turned himself toward the female demon who still hadn't recovered from the shock, as a bone-freezing voice reached up to her senses.\n\"Are you the cause of the Blessings' disappearance ?\"\nThe female demon jerked as she looked at Austin in pure bafflement, unsure what she had just heard. But when she finally realized the cause of this unnatural human's agitation, a grin formed across her face.\n\"Fufu~ Yeah, it's me who-\"\n**SLING**\nBefore her words could have reached it's conclusion, a flash suddenly passed through her before she felt what she had never thought of letting happen.\nThe thread which connects a being from their mortality was shrewd by the human even before she could have reacted.\nHer eyes went wide as she saw her vision dropping toward the ground, with the lights of the day fading at an unnatural pace.\n'Huh? Am I...'\n\"Philia!!!!! You bastard!\"\nThe male demon, who just sensed the life of his beloved reaching its end, enraged furiously before rising to his feet with dark miasma covering his aura.\nAustin whipped his spear once to wipe the little blood stains, as he stared solemnly at the furious demon.\nThe demon, without hesitating even, for instance, launched his still intact hand toward Austin's face, which the latter one didn't confront this time, rather....\n**SLICK**\nWith a smooth footing, Austin titled his body to get out of the demon's trajectory, before he slashed the blade of his spear and cut off the demon's hand in a clean cut.\n**Splurt**\nThe demon stared at the dark purplish blood gushing out of his arm like a faucet as his attack never met its destination.\n\"Don't struggle.\"\nAustin was keeping this demon alive since he needed information, or he would have sent this one to the other side as well, along with his lover.\nThe demon still had enough rage left that he tried using one of the spells on Austin, only to get negated even before he could have conjured it entirely.\nFeeling powerless to take his vengeance, the demon contemplated deeply as he kept his gaze straight on the human.\nValek's strength was nothing compared to what humungous might this human carries. His spell was being played like it was the easiest thing to suppress in the world.\nHis lover was dead. The mission was on the verge of collapsing. His life wasn't in his control anymore. All the routes seemed blocked when an unexpected path came to his rescue.\n\"Austin.\"\n___________________\nA/n:- Sorry for the short chappy.\nEditor : Zenon #4120",

      "content": "[Venessa's POV:]\n**BOOOOOOM**\nAs the thunderous shockwave reverberated across the battlefield, our movements halted altogether.\nFrom what I sensed, Austin was the one who went in that direction just some moments ago, and adding the sudden explosion into account; I was sure it was Austin who was the center of it.\nIt was beyond believable how he annihilated that many demons single-handedly using a spell that was far from what I knew was possible to derive through mana.\nI mean, I have seen a legendary mage in action, but the elemental attack Austin released in so less time made me doubt whether we were living on the same plain or not?\n\"Kyou-kun, wait! You haven't healed enough to use levitation.\"\nTurning my head, I saw Sicily-san holding Kyouki-san as it seemed he was about to take off toward the place where Austin went.\nWell, I could understand what he must have been thinking. Kyouki-san was a very prideful man, and I highly respect this trait of his.\nBeing helped by Austin in so many instances but not being able to pay back even once must have put weight on him.\nBut if he was a prideful man, I was a woman who would take every responsibility of his as mine. I have taken a vow to help him at every step wherever he leads.\n\"Kyouki-san.\"\nWalking up to him, I supported his front as I gazed caringly at my slightly childish hero, before speaking in the gentlest tone.\n\"If you have trust in me, then rest well. I will help Austin in your stead.\"\n\"Vanessa...\"\nHis eyes shone strangely with complicated thoughts spreading across his face, as he stared at me with slight reluctance.\nBut I wasn't ready to let him continue his persuasion, so with a slightly firm squeeze on his shoulder, I concluded my parting words.\n\"Don't worry, Kyouki-san. I might not be competent enough, but I still carry the unbreakable will to face anything with a confident front. So please be obedient and stay here.\"\n_____________\nNot so long after, I parted from my faction and left a still half unwilling Kyouki-san, who was reluctant to let me go alone. But since nobody else could face high-rank demons other than Sicily, who was healing Kyouki-san right now, I chose to depart solo.\nTo my utter amazement, the blessings which seemed to have disappeared from existence, returned to me, and I was sure it was the same for others too.\n'Well, this sure helps.'\nUsing gravity manipulation, which I had confidence in previously until I witnessed Austin, I levitated toward the inside fort of the academy while keeping aware of my surroundings.\nIt's not only Levitation but also various other things I have realized, how inferior I was if compared to a monstrous entity like Austin.\nBut even with that, I never lost my spark to move forward. If before my target was to reach up to Kyouki-san's level, then now I had a different goal.\nA goal that might make me a person whom no one would ever dare to look down upon.\nIf a person like Austin, who had no backing from his family, was able to pull it off, then with the help of my papa and friends, I believed it would become doable if I give it my all.\n'Hmm?'\nFinally, I caught a glimpse of the section of the premise from where the massive explosion erupted a minute ago.\n'What the....'\nApart from rumbles and a strange humungous black orb, what astonished me was a beheaded demon lying lifelessly on the ground.\nFrom just the looks of it, the demon seemed to be the reason for the blessing's banishment since the other was still alive, despite being in a miserable condition tho...\nThe demon with a considerable build was facing Austin with one arm severed and another one loosely hanging like it was broken.\nIn all honesty, I didn't feel any kind of threat from it, so I called for Austin so I could help him in any way possible.\n\"Austin!!\"\nBut little did I expect that it would end up like the worst foolishness...\n_____________________\nAt the very instance, Venessa called for Austin as she tried to draw her sword; the demon found the chance and used the last ounce of his strength in his still usable limbs, before darting toward the descending figure of the amber-haired warrior.\n\"Huh?\"\nVanessa wasn't even able to exclaim properly before her vision got covered, and her body weight increased by high folds.\n**DHAK**\nVanessa, along with the demon entangled with her, ultimately fell to the ground at an astonishing pace making an audible sound upon the impact\nAustin turned his eyes without much of a reaction as he saw the demons on both hind limbs intervene around Venessa's torso, with his sharp teeth just above Venessa's nape.\nThe reaction after getting captivated arrived slightly delayed, before Venessa flailed her body to jerk away the disgusting creature.\n**SPRUT**\n\"Don't struggle, girl. I won't hesitate to tear off your neck in one bite.\"\nAfter piercing her skin slightly, the demon spoke in a hoarse tone as the maroon liquid poured down Venessa's collarbone and stained her vest.\nGulping hard, Venessa didn't try to move as due to the sudden presence wrapped around her made her terrified beyond tolerance.\nHer face became entirely pale as she closed her eyes in anxiety and fear.\nAustin's eyes were cold as since the time he joined the battlefield. His temperament was as natural as ever while he treated the situation like he was on a walk in the park.\nThe demon sneered as he felt Austin's aloof approach toward the whole scenario was fake and superficial.\n\"Let me go human with that globe right there, or I won't let this woman see the lights of another day.\"\nValek spoke his mind as he made the offer clear since he still wanted to accomplish the mission so at least he could remain alive after returning.\nBut little did he expect that Austin would reject the offer so outrightly!\n\"Kill her but forget about even touching that globe.\"\nHis voice resonated clear as day, which made Valek, as well as the previous terrified Venessa, quite wide-eyed.\nThe demon could discern when someone was having a hard time keeping their word, but looking at this peculiar human's expression, he might bring catastrophe if someone touched the black orb.\nValek kept his rubric gaze neutral for some moments before he finally decided to end this banter once and for all.\n\"Since you really don't feel anything toward this woman, then I will be taking her life as compensation.\"\nStabbing his sharp fangs in the soft flesh of the human, Venessa bit her lips as she felt the scorching sensation from her nape, as drops of tears dared to fall out.\nThe demon's eyes were focused on the blond youth as he inflicted pain on Vanessa and would have killed her in some moments now since Valek knew Austin needed him for the intel.\nBut suddenly a thick black fog covered the vicinity, and even before the demon could have bared his fang deeper into her skin, the body he was clinging to disappeared like it was all an illusion.\n\"Huh?\"\nThe demon exclaimed as he felt the fog fading away not so long after, and not only that, his body wasn't listening to his command at all.\n\"Last chance. Struggle any more than this, and I will throw all my concerns about your background and end you right here and now.\"\nThe demon heard Austin's voice, but since he couldn't even move his frozen body from the ground at all, how was he supposed to struggle anymore?\nAustin turned blindfold toward him before he glanced at the weeping figure of Venessa, who still was clinging to him since the time Austin saved her using his skill.\nThe way Venessa's arms were wrapped around Austin's torso while she grieved in silence due to the death she felt some moments ago, made it challenging for Austin to separate himself abruptly.\n**Sniff*Sniff**\nFolding his hand on his back Austin sighed as he let Venessa calm down first, but little did he remember that someone else was also present beside them.\n\"Austin~ Care to explain~.\"\n_________________\nA/N:- Drop a comment~\nEditor : Zenon #4130",

      "content": "Currently, in a thinly lighted room could be seen two people sharing a very intimate space.\nThe sun had long vanished from the sky with a serene white lonely moon hanging with pitch darkness spread like a heavy blanket making the night grimmer than usual.\nBut the outside world or the current situation around the Eden Academy couldn't justify the pink atmosphere surrounding these two love birds.\n\"What are you doing, Luna?\"\nThe person who, throughout the massive war, remained poker-faced and did everything calculatingly was now smiling like a fool as he allowed his lover to do as she pleased.\nAustin's room was currently filled with a peculiar floral fragrance because of the company of the person whose odor Austin loves the most.\n\"Erasing that thot's smell from you.\"\nThe one who was clinging to Austin with her front pressed on him and legs intervened around his torso was none other than the beautiful maiden popularly known as the Saint.\nAustin sighed before he made his grip on Luna's back more firm as they sat at the edge of the bed while hugging in a way that didn't even let a single gust pass through them.\nLuna was currently rubbing her cheeks on Austin's chest and kissing him time after time to make it clear who this man belonged to.\nEven though she kissed him while they were still on the battleground in front of Venessa, Luna couldn't just rest well when there were so many man-hunting bitches roaming out there.\nAustin was utterly delighted to see Luna fawning over him, but he was more concerned about her health first. But looking at her reluctance to let go, he could just accept his defeat and let himself get pampered by this adorably jealous Luna\n\"Ah...\"\nAustin felt Luna's sucking extremely hard near his collar bone which made him let out a slight sound on reflex.\n\"Hah...now this looks perfect.\"\nAs Luna grinned, Austin sensed he had been marked with his fourth hickey, but since he wasn't afraid of anyone seeing it, he didn't complain and just patted her back before asking.\n\"Satisfied?\"\n\"Not completely, but this will do for now.\"\nSaying so, Luna redirected her gaze on her man, only to find him gazing at her lovingly without an ounce of annoyance even though she had been behaving like a whining child since they had returned.\nCrossing her arms across Austin's neck, Luna tilted her head playfully as she asked.\n\"You don't complain even if I behave so spoiled. Is it that master Austin has fallen sooooooo deep in my love, that this side of mine doesn't bother him~.\"\nShe asked what she knew the answer to already, but as she said, she wanted to be spoiled. And hearing her beloved expressing his love never feels short of enthralling.\nAustin was also aware of her thoughts, so, with a serene smile, he obliged with his lady's unspoken request.\n\"It's not only you with whom I fell in love with. Your temper, your mood swings, your spoiled behavior, your jealousy. I love all of them. So you can say I am foolishly drowned in your love to the point of no return.\"\nLuna giggled playfully as she enjoyed the affection her beloved showered her with.\nTilting her head to the other side, she felt Austin leaning back on his arms as he kept his gaze unwavering from her.\n\"Then what about my foul mouth? You love it too?\"\nAustin smiled and, without any hesitation, replied as he collected Luna's precious hair and tucked it behind her small ear.\n\"Yes, I do.\"\n\"Then what about my hair? I remember when you acted like an arrogant noble, my hair was your primary source of target.\"\nAustin felt a sigh leaking from his lips as he remembered a not-so-distant past before he cupped Luna's left cheek.\n\"I love them the most, that's why I couldn't help but talk about them in the past, although in a harsh manner.\"\nEnjoying his warmth, Luna leaned her face as her next question seeped out reflexively.\n\"Then what about my face? Do you like it?\"\nAustin shook his head as he heard the adorable query of Luna, which seemed to be unworthy of being answered, given how popular she was among the nations for her looks.\nBut then again, she doesn't care about the world; instead, she wants to hear what Austin feels. And since he has started to realize her thought process, it didn't take him time to respond, in all honesty.\n\"It's the most beautiful and charming face I have ever seen. How could I not fall in love with it?\"\nWith her eyes slightly narrowed, Luna smiled with her lips at their greatest peak, before something popped into her mind as she took Austin's hand, which was on her face, before gliding it slowly down her neck sliding inside her cleavage.\n\"And...what about my body? Does it excite Master Austin?\"\nThere was a glint in her oceanic eyes, which Austin had become familiar with as he gazed at her before his brows raised subjectively.\n\"Should I answer it verbally...or...\"\nWithout even being guided by Luna, Austin's hand already started roaming immodestly as he began to target some of the sensitive areas on her bosom.\n\"Mm~ Well, I ah~ would have liked that b-mm~ but it's okay for you to be rough~.\"\n_____________________\nAt the same time, when the love birds, consisting of two young youths, were drowning in a night filled with love and lust, an entity sat on a chair with a grim expression on his face.\nThis inhumane presence was none other than Valek, who, after losing his lover and failing miserably on the battlefield against Austin, got captivated by the Professors under the guidance of Headmaster.\nThe supreme pope of the church chanted the barrier inside which Valek was captivated.\nBut looking at Valek's miserable condition and shaken state of mind, it seemed highly unlikely that he would have run away. And taking the failure of the mission into account, Valek's chances to return to 'that' place fell down to zero.\nHe could now just wait for someone to end his suffering and send him to the other side where might await his beloved.\n**CREAK**\nThe wooden door of the small room parted before the figure of a middle-aged human appeared from the other side.\nApart from his purple and golden robe covering his one-and-a-half meter body, the golden single-framed round monocle seemed to be his striking feature.\nEntering inside without minding Valek's presence at all, Alex arranged his things on the small table just beside the barrier-covered wooden chair, on which Valek was tied.\n\"You thought you avoided Sir Charles, then you might achieve your mission flawlessly, yet you failed in front of a seemingly more brutal monster. How unfortunate~.\"\nValek didn't react, but deep inside, he indeed felt the most miserable to think that after dodging that battle bull on the border, they would face such a terrifying being in the face of a frail human.\n\"But why do you even try to sidestep Sir Charles when you could have killed him with that many demons?\"\nAlex tilted his head in astonishment as he asked himself. The reason he didn't direct the query to the one who could answer it was simple.\nAlex knew that it wasn't easy to drill information out of someone until he doesn't dirty his hands.\nTurning toward the demon with a chilly smiling face Alex muttered in a flowery tone, much to Valek's fret.\n\"Well, we have a long night ahead, so I hope we can enjoy each other's company, Mr. Demon~.\"\n______________________\nA/N:- Will upload R-18 on Patreon real soon.

      "content": "Lying on a cozy bed with a warm blanket draped over their naked body was the loving couple who, just by looks, seemed to have a very intimate last night.\nAustin's eyes were still closed as he enjoyed the warmth his love was providing. Embracing her small yet huggable body, Austin felt fulfilled as he stayed half-asleep.\nLuna, on the other hand, had her eyes clearly open but lazily, as she gazed upon the man who had kept her awake till daybreak.\nJust like she planted her marks on him last night, now her body was labeled with his rough yet sweet love.\nHer heart was now at peace when she gawked at the relaxed face of her man. The slight eerie feeling ignited inside of her yesterday, was now fading away since she trusts Austin more than she does herself.\nTaking out her hand from the blanket, she felt Austin's hold on her belly tightening since he might have thought of her leaving his side.\nLuna almost giggled upon sensing his childish yet adorable gesture, as she brought her hand on his cheek.\nHer delicate finger traced Austin's features as she gently ran them along his tender cheek down to his sharp jawline as she enjoyed the sensation wholeheartedly.\n\"Mm m. Aren't you taking advantage of me?\"\nHis voice was hoarse, displaying how sleepish he was as he lazily parted his lids to gaze upon the mischievous saint.\n\"You touched me shamelessly at every corner last night. It's just a minimal compensation.\"\nA smile made its way on Austin's thin lips as, with a strong inhale, he brought Luna closer to him, practically enveloping her in the process.\nGetting a full whiff of her natural body fragrance and enjoying the suppleness of his beloved wrapped in his unrestrained embrace, Austin responded with a grin.\n\"Well, didn't you enjoy it as well?\"\nA slight blush rose in an instant as Luna remembered the scene which she might not be able to forget even in her death, that level of embarrassing it was.\nAustin enjoyed her reaction as he let Luna hide in his embrace as deep as she desired.\nSilence befell in the still thinly lighted room as the two drowned in the world that they share with each other only. Feeling each other's warmth, they transferred emotions that didn't require the support of words.\nAmidst the loving silence, Luna seemed to remember something as she lifted her face from Austin's chest before asking in a slightly expectant tone.\n\"Is your Villain's requirement fulfilled?\"\nSince the war was a massive turn of events and adding Austin's impactful participation, Luna hoped that the days of being a pretend villain would end and she could live freely with Austin from today onwards.\nBut looking at Austin's troubled expression, her hopes crumbled, and his following words made her worried too.\n\"Well, I didn't receive the completion notification, and looking at the system screen...\"\nTurning his gaze toward his front, Austin checked the necessity of Villain point, which brought a frown on his face.\n[Villain's Point]\n[Weekly Requirement :- 1570/2800]\n[Time before reset :- 3 days 16 hours 8 min]\n\"....I got only three days to fill almost half of the requirement.\"\nDespite saying it with such a casual tone, Luna was well aware of what was in actuality, going through his mind.\nThis was the last week; Austin needed to care about Villain's System since, after this, his sister wouldn't need any kind of supernatural support to return to her healthy self.\nBut the most crucial factor on which Austin relied, the war with demons, only provided him with half of the points. And adding the previous points he had before the war, he didn't even gain a thousand points from this battle.\n\"Austin...I think the theory we had about this system is slightly misleading. It's not only about your participation but the impact it has on the world.\"\nAustin raised his brows as he failed to discern what Luna had just said, but thankfully her following words made her point clear.\n\"Like this sudden war wasn't brought by you, but you were just part of it. Umm...like the source of this whole event wasn't even related to you; that's why the system just threw some small points. However, the event with the Terror Demon in the expedition. That bastard launched his attack on you, which worked as a catalyst, and the system evaluated that the whole scenario occurred because of your presence.\"\nAustin's eyes went slightly wide as he somehow understood the essence of the theory Luna brought up.\nIt's as she said. The baptism and the way he insulted Venessa were all of his own accords. He wasn't part of it. Instead, he was the centerpiece.\nVarious knots unraveled with just a single explanation of her which made Austin realize something.\n\"So I have to do something on my own initiative to gain the last remaining points…huh.\"\nLuna didn't say anything since even though she was the one who eventually brought Austin to such a conclusion, she didn't want him to take any unnecessary risk.\nAustin kept on contemplating the matter for more than ten minutes with his eyes fixed on the ceiling as he thought about the possible route he could pursue to end this struggle once and for all.\nBut whatever he thought, he couldn't strike a war when the Gram nation was already in turmoil and the hero was on the verge of being half dead.\nAll left was only a single path that could fulfill the requirements and also help him pay back the possible loss he could have suffered.\n\"Let's see what that demon has to say. My next move will be on his testimony.\"\n_____________________\nAround ten in the morning, the couple left the bed as they had a peaceful bathing session which eventually led to another hour of love-making before they left Austin's room.\nSince various professors were injured and the inside fort was also damaged, the classes were suspended for the next three days.\nStrolling lazily under the sun, which was covered with heavy clouds, Luna and Austin made their way towards the Cathedral where the captive demon was stored.\nThe school was near to empty as most of the students returned to their homeland for this short vacation. Most of them had a sense of fear which made them not stay in the academy for the time being. But little did they know that until this couple was in the Eden Academy, there wouldn't be any safer place elsewhere.\nThe church was also non-populate as some of the priests roamed in and out to help the survivors and help with the funeral ceremony too.\nThe place where Valek was restrained lay under the surface, in the basement.\nAustin and Luna descended the stairs without permission before a single wooden door greeted them at the end of the steps.\n**Knock**\nAustin knocked softly on the door before the doorknob was twisted not so long after.\nThe one who emerged from the other side was none other than the bespectacled court magician, Alex Nuèye.\nHis eyes had heavy bags underneath, signifying how long it's been since he had a good night's sleep. But it wasn't the eyes on which the duo's attention fell onto.\n\"You killed him?\"\nThe reason why Austin asked in a casual tone about the demon, was because Alex currently has his face covered in purple liquid, which undoubtedly belonged to Valek.\nAnd not only that, Alex's left hand was holding a long skewer too, which made it look like he had a lively interrogation session with the pitiful demon.\n\"No, but it will probably die, if a high-profile healer doesn't bestow their blessing on that creature.\"\nLuna sneered visibly before extending her hand as a cyan glow covered her palm. The process took only three seconds before Luna retracted her hand, signifying how brilliantly she healed without even looking at her patient.\n\"Subarashi~ I can't get enough of such young talent~.\"\nAlex shivered in delight and wholly ignored the death glares he was receiving from Luna.\n\"Well, I got to know various things from that creature, but there is one piece of information that intrigued me.\"\nLuna and Austin glanced at each other for a second before Austin looked back at his front and asked in a slightly heavy tone.\n\"And what's that?\"\nSighing, Alex leaned on the stone wall before taking out his monocle as he answered Austin curiously.\n\"Unlike the demons, we have heard and seen until now, this war and the abduction of Saint-sama were all planned by a human. Strange as it may sound, but demons were actually working for humans like us.\"\nThe listeners' eyes went slightly wide as they heard the shocking revelation, which they could never have guessed to be the case.\nDemons are born to bring chaos to the world, and apart from the Monarch of Darkness, they obey no one.\nAnd suddenly being told that those half-minded beasts were following someone's command who belonged to the race which demons consider nothing more than their source of mana?\n\"Alex...who was it who sent this army and ordered to abduct Luna?\"\nAustin's voice became a little fiercer as he realized that it wasn't demons who were pursuing the endless mana pool of Luna but rather some sly human who had their distinguished goal fixated on her.\n\"Ah...the Xylex Nation in the South. The place which has been nurturing their own summoned hero in secrecy. I bet you have heard about it, right?\"\n______________________\nA/N:- A new arc, a new character. Let's goo…\nEditor : Zenon",

      "content": "From what Austin and Luna heard, there were various things that became clearer than before.\nThe demon who was on the verge of dying had already spilled every bean he could have, so what would be happening to him after this, solely would rely on Alex.\nThe major points which were revealed from the demon's testimony had two notable facts.\nFirst, the person who helped the demons with the information related to Charles's whereabouts and the private Intel of the territory, was none other than Riley: Leader of the Explorer faction who was guarding the Eastern Side of the fort along with the Headmaster.\nThe Sakura-haired mage warrior had a tremendous potential to become a knight of the Royal order in the future. But the teenage fool in love made a grave mistake and sold his own nation's security.\nHis blind love for Sicily made him bring this catastrophe since the enemy nation promised him to reward Sicily if the plans went well and the demons achieves their goal.\nBut in the end, what Riley got was imprisonment in the underground jail of Eden Academy.\nNo one other than Alex, Headmaster Merlin, Luna, and Austin was aware of Riley's betrayal since it would eventually make the Emperor know that the demons were working under Southern Nation's order.\nThe reason why Alex chose to hide the aforementioned information, for the time being, was only he knew. Still, Headmaster Merlin only agreed to keep his mouth shut until the problem on the borders doesn't get resolved.\nLuna and Austin didn't have a problem either, as the prior one couldn't care less what her schoolmates conspires. And as for Austin, then he wanted to achieve his system points, so this silence of the nations was perfect for him to do everything in secrecy.\nThe second interesting thing they found from the demon's memories was that this whole war and the demons involved in this were sent by the same nation where Austin and Luna went for their date.\nThe same place where Austin met the ramen shop woman belonging to the plain where Austin belonged in his previous life.\nIt seems the King of Southern Kingdom, Xylex, was preparing for something massive as even having a true powerhouse in the name of Summoned Heroes; the Emperor was planning to take Luna's strength for himself too.\nAustin's temperament wasn't much good when he heard about it. On the other side, Luna was merrily smiling upon seeing how her man was getting worked up for her sake.\n\"The weird part is, why they didn't end the war on the border and infilterated forcibly. If the first line of defense, Sir Charles, would have fallen, then the front-on war would have been more advantageous for the demons.\"\nAlex's slightly grumbling tone echoed clearly in the spare room in the cathedral, as he served tea for the duo.\nLuna became perplexed upon hearing Alex's unsolved query which by looks seemed genuine. Turning her head, she saw Austin with a similar expression as her, signifying he also seemed to find Alex's trouble, strange.\n\"You don't know about it?\"\nIt was Austin who asked, much to Alex's perplexion as the bespectacled mage blinked his eyes before asking.\n\"I don't know what exactly?\"\nLooking at his reaction Austin and Luna concluded that Alex indeed was oblivion about Charles' secret. From Austin's memory, Luna came to know Charles' true might. That's why she was worried about the arena battle between the two.\n'It seems I over-evaluated you.'\nWithout any intention to talk further, Austin left Alex hanging in the middle of the chat, much to the latter's frustration.\n_________________\nAfter some more chattering, the duo left the church hand in hand as they strolled their way to the cafè to have their breakfast.\nWhile walking with her hand intervened with Austin's arm, Luna seemed to feel worried about something. She tried to hold this conversation for after they ate, so the date doesn't get ruined, but her worries got better of her.\n\"Austin...you are planning to go there today?\"\nIt goes without saying that Austin needed to fulfill the Villain's point anyhow since he wasn't sure what consequence would occur if the requirement fails, which he hasn't let happen in the past.\nAnd for that, Austin leaving for Xylex was the best route to pursue as there would be many instances for him to change the world occurrence and future prospectus.\nBut what worried the silver-haired Saintess was the summoned hero whom the Ramen Shop owner mentioned to be in Demi-god class.\nDespite not fearing even a person was demi-god or not, Luna strangely had a horrible suspicion about this whole situation altogether.\nHearing Luna's question, Austin felt wavering for a slight moment, but the resolve he had made was far more substantial than Luna's unspoken persuasion.\n\"Yes, I have to, Luna. I know what you are feeling, but I can't stop. More than my Villain's point or anything else, I want to get back on that Emperor for what he tried to do to you. So stop worrying needlessly and put on a face which suits more in this situation.\"\nAustin squeezed Luna's hand as he spoke in a rich tone, making her startled all of a sudden.\nLooking at his smiling face, which shrouded the determination he had resolved upon, Luna's mind became muddled, but in the end, she suppressed all her concerns, and with a beautiful smile, she replied.\n\"Let's do our best together.\"\n_______________________\nAt the same time, when the duo was heading for a lovely date time, in a courtroom of the palace, which was miles away from Gram, sat a group of people who, by appearance, looked like high-class nobles.\nThe room was thinly lighted with a centric round table placed in the middle of the room with twelve preoccupied chairs arranged neatly.\n\"I hope you all have heard about the demons' failure in Gram.\"\nThe person sitting at the forefront of the table spoke in a casual tone even though he was talking about the failure of war, no less.\nThe people he addressed, nodded without much contemplation since the news had already arrived hours ago, which led to the occurrence of this emergency meeting.\n\"My lord, but we haven't received any official alert from Gram nor any mana mail from our spies.\"\nA man wearing a brilliant golden robe asked in a slightly confused tone as even after the demons failed miserably for unknown reasons, it was still unclear why Gram was so silent.\n\"Well, that vile ass Valek has been captured, so he must have spilled beans, but the person who interrogated him was none other than that bespectacled bitch, Alex. What can you expect from a sly fox? He must have been planning something behind the scenes.\"\nThe look on everyone's face, other than the speaker, became slightly ugly as they heard their lord mentioning the talented Magician of Gram's Court who was infamous for his dark deeds.\n\"What would be our next move, Sire?\"\nAnother man asked in a slow voice as the matter seemed to be more complicated than it first sounded when they heard the news of the demons' loss.\n\"Now what? Summon the hero; we will send her to get the Saintess anyhow. Whatever happens, I can't let this upcoming offering ceremony be stalled just by some measly creature incompetence.\"\nA gasp resonated in the room upon hearing the mention of the hero. Ignoring everyone's reaction, the Emperor of Xylex leaned his chin on his intervened finger as, with a cunning smile, he muttered under his breath.\n\"It's time for the world to know what is the true might of a real hero. \"\n_______________\nA/N:- A massive event is going to occur with some world-shattering revelation.

Please go and see Sicily.\"\nI lied.\nThe person to whom I vowed never to lie and be honest under any circumstances, I lied to that person.\nAnd the reason was so measly that I am feeling like an idiot right now.\n**SLIDE**\nAs Kyouki-san left the infirmary room, I laid back on the bed. Staring at the white ceiling, I thought about the events that had happened some hours ago.\nThe whole war, the frightening battles, and the overwhelming fear didn't leave such a significant impact, which I felt from that particular incident.\nMy biggest foolishness made me captive of that red-eyed demon who could have been handled by Austin even if I hadn't intervened.\nBut me and my big mouth led to such a turn of events, and I was taken as a hostage by that creature.\nI still feel chills running down my spine as the memory of my body being entrapped by that vile creature flashes down the lane.\nThat foul smell, that creepy sensation, and the ominous sense of danger still lingered like an inseparable leech to every inch of my skin.\nI had never felt something like that before, even though I have gone through life-threatening battles and have seen the way papa fights.\nI know it was disgraceful for a warrior like me to say it, but at that moment, I wanted nothing more than just to run away and hide to save my life.\nAt that moment, the chivalry I had been taught, the principle I had instilled, the vows I had taken, nothing remained in my consciousness. I just wanted to get away from that demon anyhow.\nWhen the demon pierced his teeth in my skin, I felt death ringing heavily and binding my senses at an alarming pace.\nThe chance of my survival started to seem equivalent to negligible.\nBut suddenly that happened...\nI don't know what conversation happened between the other two beside me on the battlefield, but after just ten seconds since I had lost my hopes, someone came to rescue me.\nAnd that person was none other than the same boy whom I loathed the most in the past.\nThe boy whom I constantly taunted for being a sissy and a shame on mankind, pulled me back from the death door.\nI didn't know when he became so strong, but he was able to overwhelm the battlefield one-sidedly, and here, he even saved me without even breaking a sweat.\nAt that instance, I didn't know what came over me, but before I could have thought anything else, I was already hugging Austin as a baby clinging to their parents when bullied.\nThe tears I shed and the fear I felt slowly started fading in the warmth I found from a man whom I never even imagined talking to with a straight face.\nIf it had been my past self, then I might have felt disgusted with myself, but now strangely, I wasn't feeling anything out of place.\nEven though my mind was a lot calmer now, if compared to that time, I still wasn't having any discomfort thinking about my actions at all.\nI know it would be shameless of me to even think about it when I already have surrendered my love for Kyouki-san, but I somehow liked how I felt when I was embracing Austin.\nIt indeed was an eventful day when I gained so many sensations and memories that I wasn't aware of in the past.\nSome were horrible, some were confusing, and some of them just soothe my heart whenever I think about it.\nWhatever they were, I was sure I wouldn't be able to forget a single thing that had made my mind mess and forced me to lie so I could just sort out what was wrong with me.\n'Seriously...it's all because of you. Who said to change so drastically and make a mess of my emotions? I will blame it on you. Hmph!'\n_______________________\nAt the same time, when Venessa was fighting with her own emotions and figuring out what had gone wrong with her, a duo stood outside a metallic door as they whispered something silently.\nThese two women, by appearance, looked like typical maids with black and white maid uniforms covering their bodies and raven hairs braided elegantly in the same design.\nThe door before which they were standing by the outer surface looked like a heavy vault-type room that could store some catastrophic-level monsters.\nThe sound of heavy winds and occasional blows reverberated even though the metal door was far away from the source of such noises.\n\"How long has she been doing that?\"\nOne of the maids with slit eyes and comparatively taller than the other one spoke in a meek tone like she was hiding her voice; even the sounds of blows from the inside were heavy enough to suppress even a shout.\nTiptoeing, the other one peeked through the small window built at the head of the door.\nThe shorter maid, with a round face, sighed upon seeing the scene inside still the same as she had seen a day ago.\n\"More than 27 hours already. Three hours more, and she will break her own record of doing nothing but to swing a blade continuously at the same spot.\"\nThe taller maid also sighed as she heard the beyond believable fact about the person who was training inside the room.\nBefore the two could have chatted any further, someone approached them or, to be precise, went toward the metallic door.\n\"Is she inside?\"\nA heavy tone fell inside the waiting space as the two maids looked at the tall man who appeared to be in his early twenties, arising out of nowhere.\n\"Yu-Yuuske-sama!? Y-yes..hero-sama is inside.\"\nThe maid, who, after witnessing the man's grave expression, became flustered beyond belief as she somehow managed to utter the response the man needed.\nWith a nod, the lean young man clicked the door open before a heavy gust threw the two maids away like a broken kite.\n\"\"AHHHHHH!!\"\nThe man didn't bat an eye on the plea for help before he walked inside without feeling any difficulty at all.\nClosing the door on his back, the expression of the man whom the maid regarded as Yuuske shifted to a brighter end.\nThe frown on his charming face immediately switched places with a smile that could make women fawn over it with just a glance.\nWith his eyes focused on the single person inside the colossal hall, which was devoid of any particular color or any furniture, Yuuske advanced without minding the shockwaves in the slightest.\nHis rubric eyes shined as he saw the woman's sinful figure, which looked highly enticing with the sweat she was covered in.\nWithout letting the woman notice his gaze, he withdrew his eyes and walked elegantly toward her.\n\"It's been long, Mina.\"\nSuddenly the black katana, which the woman was swinging in a different direction, changed its trajectory before its tip landed just in between the two eyes of Yuuske.\n\"It's not my name.\"\nA bone-freezing voice that contained no definite emotion left the woman's pale yet attractive lips as she stared at the man with the explicit intention of disapproving of his whole existence.\nWithout minding the blade, Yuuske tilted his head before he spoke in a merrier tone.\n\"But you never told me or anyone your name.\"\nThe raven-haired woman didn't reply; she just pulled her sword and was about to continue swinging when Yuuske hurriedly interjected.\n\"Umm...the Emperor has summoned you. It seems he finally wants everyone to know about your presence. \"\nThe woman kept her head turned slightly toward the man until he finished before she went back to face an indefinite space as she brought her katana to swing aimlessly and continue her training.\nBut Yuuske seemed to have a rare mood swing, as he didn't intend to let go of the conversation so shortly.\n\"Why are you persistent, Mina? Why are you not accepting me and dreaming about someone else who might have been dead-\"\n**CRACK**\nSuddenly Yuuske's voice choked in his throat as he felt the terrifying killing intent from meters apart from him. The room, which seemed colossal some moments ago, felt extremely small under the overwhelming pressure the woman was releasing.\nThe ground underneath her feet cracked before a crater of 200 meters formed because of the single step woman took to warn Yuuske.\nHer eyes which generally seemed devoid of emotion, were now overwhelmed with rage as she stared at the man as if he had just taken away her most precious thing.\n\"Do not ever think of associating that word with my Nii-sama! I will slice your tongue along with every fiber from your body while keeping your consciousness awake. So keep your business away from me before I lose my restraints and do something which you might not be able to reverse!\"\n_____________________\nA/N:- ?",

      "content": "Xylex.\nThe continent, situated in the South and is mainly known for its trade and agriculture.\nDespite being the densest continent and, from land mass perspective, the biggest one, Xylex wasn't much resourceful at any time, world crisis erupted.\nIn the past, the continent, which had the divine protection of the heavenly beast Scylun, seldom actively participated in any conflict.\nLike the ancestors, the current emperor of Xylex, Thannath Seiya Exylam, doesn't interact much with worldly affairs, although they have a friendly relationship with the other six continents.\nGiven the rate of superhumans and magicians, Xylex brings up every year; the rest of the world has considered this land of granary as the weakest continent of them all.\nBut very few people know that the continent, which adores the tag of being weakest, has taken a step that would result in a leap in its power equilibrium. A single lead would shake the world hierarchy and unsettle the world balance.\nHero Summoning.\nThe ancient myth, which now has become a part of children's tales and storybooks, has been reanimated.\nThe folklore verifies that in the distant past, there came a time when the darkness over the world spread beyond the capability of any human, then came the idea of Hero Summoning.\nThe ancient Runic technique, which requires a sacrifice of hundreds of offerings and a colossal amount of mana, ignites the spell and calls the hero from an indefinite space.\nSince the techniques required sacrifices and runes, which weren't found in ages, no kingdom took an interest in it. And the Morach of Darkness being dormant past these many years also negated the need to summon a hero.\nHow Xylex was able to recreate the Mythic Grade spell and summoned not one but five heroes at the same time was something only the kingdom's top council was aware of.\nNow why the summoning hero was so overly evaluated and required such a high grade of investment?\nSimple. It's the power boost the summoned heroes are bestowed along with the transfer of worlds.\nThe monstrous strength and unparalleled skills they get with the summoning ritual, makes them unique commodity who can easily overwhelm every battlefield they step upon.\nNow the question arises, at what price did Emperor Thannath bring so many catastrophic entities into this world?\n_______________________\n\"Please remind me, why these two are here?\"\nWith annoyance clearly blended in her voice, the platinum-haired saint asked the person beside her as she looked at a duo in front.\n\"Because I need the hero's face so all the blame can be drawn upon him while I do the work from the background.\"\nAustin, with a wry smile, explained to his not-so-happy lover, as the trip to Xylex was primarily planned for only Luna and Austin.\n\"It's rude to use my Kyou-kun as a puppet, Austin.\"\nThe one who pouted was the olive-haired girl Sicily as she countered Austin's non-fabricated words while clinging to the man beside her.\n\"It's okay, Sicily. We both know what he meant.\"\nKyouki tried to calm Sicily down as he also understood why in the first place, Austin told him about this plan and asked them to come along, unlike the last time when Austin deliberately manipulated him into going to the Northern Empire.\nLuna was also aware of Austin's plan and how he wanted to work, but being unable to enjoy their honeymoon made her mood extremely sour.\nBut then again, she had an eternity to spend with Austin, so these kinds of chances would come again.\n'But still, I wanted to be alone with you...'\nWiping her non-existent tears, Luna asked Austin which was most concerning in hand.\n\"What's our next move, Austin?\"\nThe room, which was lively for some seconds, turned heavier with Luna's query as it indeed wasn't a causal trip of these four in this foreign land.\nThey were here to initiate a war. To take vengeance and to accomplish something. It might sound childish to think that a group of mere teenagers was trying to rival a whole nation, but neither of these four was going to back down; when they reached this point.\n\"Hmm...plan, huh.\"\nAustin got up before he lifted a round table from the corner of the room and placed it in the center for everyone's convenience.\nGliding his hand over the round table, a brownish sheet of paper which by texture and designs carved on it, looked like a map, appeared out of nowhere.\nSicily's eyes sparkled at such fluency and peculiar affinity with magic, before she asked subconsciously.\n\"Austin.I never got the chance to ask...but are you proficient with Space Magic too?\"\nKyouki had the same question, but sensing the ominous stare from the left of Austin, he held back his urge to ask.\n\"Aren't you getting too interested in someone else's man?\"\nKyouki felt daggers piercing his heart as he heard Luna committing herself for Austin but naturally, he didn't let it become evident from his expression.\n\"Wha-me? Of course not! I don't look anyone other than my Kyou-kun!\"\nKyouki felt some of the holes in his heart getting healed from Sicily's gentle words as he smiled thinly.\nAustin, on the other side, was silently watching the banter as he thought whether it was really okay for him to bring the duo along.\nBut as he said, he needed an identifiable face who would take the final blow on Xylex and can get the fame all for himself.\nAustin wanted vengeance but being in the spotlight wasn't his thing.\nWell, what happened back in Eden Academy was the result of his clouded mind which became like that after he saw Luna in such a state.\nBut now, things were different, and so would Austin's approach.\n\"Listen carefully....\"\n______________________\n\"Has the hero left the territory already?\"\n\"Yes, sir. She didn't use the portal; instead chose to run all the way to Gram.\"\nTwo men adorning extravagant attire walked into a massive hall as the man walking at the back answered the high and majestic, Emperor of Xylex.\nThe heated topic around the palace and in the upper echelon of the kingdom was their Summoned Hero's departure for Gram.\nIt was the first time when the Hero, whose name no one had heard until now, went outside the territory since her summoning.\nIt wasn't that she didn't want to go out; instead, she was shackled with the kingdom and only can move out on command.\n\"Hmm...well, she is a freak then she-ah!!\"\nSuddenly Thannath's steps came to an abrupt halt as his eyes started illuminating with a greenish glow, and his mouth parted like something was about to be released.\nThe man beside Thannath looked at his majesty's sudden change before he chanted a spell and erected a barrier around the Blond-Haired Emperor.\n\"Guards!!! Protect the king!\"\nThe man shouted in a heavy pitch before from the shadows emerged a group of more than a dozen black metal cladding warriors as they stood with their back facing the barrier and front focused on their surroundings\nThe way the Nobel commanded the guards and invoked the spell, signified that it wasn't the first time for Thannath to fall into such a state.\nBut it doesn't mean that these occurrences rang any fortune bells.\n'I hope my lord returns safely...'\n____________________\nInfinite space.\nThat was the only thing Thannath could see in the space he gets forcibly pulled toward often these days.\nHis eyes were normal here, unlike his original body, which still was in the main hall of his palace. With his breathing slightly unsteady, signifying the anxious state of mind, Thannath heard the voice he could never get used to.\n[I warned, yet you failed.]\nThe heavy and condemning tone, which by such a glimpse, anyone could tell that it didn't belong to a human, resonated in the void space.\nThannath shuddered upon hearing the voice of the creature he had been interacting since not so long.\n\"Should I kowtow in apology?\"\nEven though he tried to sound casual, his shaken parts of speech made it evident how scared he was currently.\nAnd it was to be expected from someone who hasn't even breached the territory of Unique Rank until now.\n[Dare to talk back, and I will make sure what you cherish would cease to exist.]\nThannath didn't speak nor sneered as he knew what the voice told was all in its capabilities.\nFor a deity, Thannath's whole kingdom would be a speck of dust that could be wiped anytime desired.\n[At least not everything went wrong.]\nThannath's eyes blinked in perplexion as he stared at his front, even though there was nothing to keep his eyes on.\n\"What?\"\n[Celeria's descendant is here. Make necessary preparation and lure her to me...]\nThe Emperor's eyes went wide in shock as he hurriedly asked the first thing that came to his mind.\n\"The Saintess of Gram is here?!!\"\nBut before even his word could have been uttered completely, the white space around him started fading.\nThannath gritted his teeth in frustration as his vision darkened just before he heard a familiar voice calling out for him.\n\"My lord...are you awake now?\"\nSlowly parting his lids, Thannath caught the nervous gaze of his trusted minister. Still, instead of quelling the bespectacled minister's worries, the first words he spoke made the minister even more anxious.\n\"Summon Yuuske and send our spies to the town. We have been ambushed.\"\n_____________________\nA/N:- Mystery would be unraveled, so don't worry and keep hanging with it~",

So beware!)\n_________________\n\"What's that?\"\nUnder the starry night of the spring, with gentle breeze flowing lazily around the surface, stood two boys leaning on the railing of a small balcony.\nThese two men were the subject of the most heated topic in the nation of Gram currently, with one being famous for existing as a natural hero and the other surprising the world with his unparalleled strength.\n'Hmm?'\nAs Austin heard Kyouki's voice from his left, he took the cigarette from his lips before a small white cloud was released on the hero's face.\n\"Fu*cough* what's this!\"\nKyouki's face contoured as he got covered in the smoke and hurriedly swayed his hand to get the peculiar disturbing smell out of his face.\n\"Well, nothing much.\"\nAustin faced forward before he continued to smoke out the last vape before throwing the filter down the balcony.\nIt was a gift from the System when he turned 15 that he would get a supply of any single thing from his previous world infinitely.\nSince he had everything necessary available, he chose the thing which reminded him the most of his good old depressing days.\nCigarette was a kind of source which reminded him from where he had come from. It keeps his feet on the ground and helps his sanity to remain stable from all these things happening in so less time.\n(A/N:- I hope you can guys won't judge him on this basis)\n\"Well, for some reason, I think that's harmful to health.\"\nAustin was amazed to see how observant Kyouki was, but his remark would have been suitable if mana wasn't operating Austin's internals.\n\"You can say, it helps release me some accumulated stress.\"\nGawking at the night scene, Austin muttered under his breath.\nThe city where they were taking shelter was on the outcast of Xylex. The reason why Austin and Luna didn't go to live in the motel which Akiko runs, was simple.\n(A/N:- Akiko= The owner of Ramen shop)\nThey just couldn't trust her.\nIt wasn't that the last meeting left any dark impression of Akiko, but the squad of four was here to rival the country, which Akiko has considered her home now.\nSo they preferred to play safe than to feel sorry.\n\"Then can you give me one too?\"\nAustin's eyes went round in perplexion as he heard the sudden request of the hero.\nTurning his head, Austin saw the expression which told that, indeed, Kyouki was being a lot troubled about something.\nHe didn't have to look anywhere else when the reason for the hero's concern was only some meters behind them, sitting in the room.\nGrabbing the packet from his inventory, Austin tapped the bottom twice and took out one for himself, too, since he was at it.\nPassing one to Kyouki, Austin gestured to place the filter between the lips, just as he did.\nKyouki, just like a curious child, did what Austin taught and grabbed the tip of the stick with both his lip and held the crook between his index and middle finger.\nIgniting the tip of his index finger, Austin lit his and Kyouki's cigarette before the enthusiastic hero inhaled without much thought.\n*COUGH*X8\n\"Fuck! It's gross!\"\nKyouki spoke in between coughs as he looked at the burning cigarette with a look of disgust.\nOn the other side, Austin lit the tip and smoked it like an elegant prince, like he was in some kind of advertisement.\n\"Well, this is for grown-up men, so that I can understand.\"\nAustin spoke with a casual tone without putting much mind to it. But the hero didn't take it as 'just a remark.'\nSliding the filter back in-between his lips, Kyouki gathered all his willpower and inhaled the maximum amount of smoke he could, ashening almost the whole cigarette.\nAustin looked at the scene with his eyes twitching before a huge cloud erupted on Austin's face.\n\"*Huff* See *Huff* I am a man as well.\"\nWith a small exhale with elemental backing, Austin wiped away all the clouds before seeing the red-eyed proud Hero who was huffing like a dog in heat.\nAustin chuckled slightly, much to Kyouki's perplexion.\n\"You are extremely competent, aren't you.\"\nKyouki blinked thrice before he realized what Austin was talking about.\nIt didn't take long before Kyouki calmed his breathing and threw away the filter with a flick.\nSighing, the raven-haired youth rested his forearms on the ledge before leaning his back to align with Austin.\n\"From the town, I come from and the things I have seen, drilled me with a single mantra.\"\nTitling his head to the left, Austin asked with his brows raised.\n\"And that is?\"\n\"Compete if you want to grow.\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nAustin took the last vape as he hummed in response. With a strong wind, his platinum blond hair swayed gently, before Kyouki followed with his words.\n\"Since childhood, I have only dreamt of becoming a man who can shoulder the world's responsibility and give a good life to everyone living beside me on this plain. Before I received my blessing I used to compete with my friends. After being bestowed, I took my town's guild master as a challenger, and after reaching Eden's Academy, every professor became my competition. This is how I want to grow in the future as I move forward and leave my rivals behind.\"\nThere was an evident glint of determination and optimism in Kyouki's eyes which made Austin somewhat startled since he could never make such a face at any time of his life.\nBut then again, Kyouki was the bonafide hero material through and through. Having such encouraging emotions was in his blood and fibers.\n\"So, who's your current rival, Hero?\"\nKyouki, without hesitation, replied like he was waiting for the question to arrive.\n\"It's you, of course.\"\nAustin wasn't much surprised by the statement since he knew what made Kyouki so much aware of him in the first place.\n\"And what're the chances of you surpassing me?\"\nAustin was somehow amused by the conversation so much that he felt like prolonging it a little longer.\n\"Well, who knows, maybe tomorrow I might outshine you and prove my worth to Lu- *ahem* to this world?\"\nAustin felt like shaking his head in defeat as a dry chuckle left his lips before he walked away from the balcony, leaving his parting words...\n\"We'll see about that....\"\n________________________\nA/N:- There's a talk between Sicily and Luna too, but since it would have made the chapter too long unless I have rushed it, I left it.\nWell, if you guys comment, then I might write another side story~",

      "content": "\"How's it?\"\nIn a thinly lighted room that, by flooring and indoors, looked like a wooden cabin, sat two people facing each other.\nCurrently, Austin was supplying mana in an artifact, he obtained from the female demon. It was the same artifact that was being used to snatch the blessings away and push Luna to such a miserable state.\nWhen Austin asked Luna why she was the most influenced by the artifact, she said:\n'Others have only the blessings, but I carry the essence.'\nAustin wasn't able to completely discern what she said, so he made necessary preparation to counter if such things happens again.\n\"Well, I do feel my mana restricted, but I can use my spells to some extent.\"\nThe two bangles on either hand of Luna illuminated with golden light signifying how they were defending her from the effect of Blessing Snatcher.\nIt goes without saying that the ornaments which Luna adorned, were also an artifact that Austin gave her, so she doesn't suffer again.\n\"Well, that would do. And Luna, only exert your strength until things aren't going out of hand. I will do my best to wrap it up by myself b-\"\nLuna squeezed Austin's hand and glared subjectively, which made him halt in his words.\n\"Don't say such things. I am finally getting a chance to fight side by side with the person I love. How can you snatch such an opportunity from me?\"\nHer eyes glimmered with utmost determination and slight excitement, as she made her point clear.\nIt was true that Austin and Luna both were powerhouses in their own way, but they never fought together on a battlefield.\nTruth to be told, Austin himself was looking forward to seeing Luna in action, but what happened in Eden Academy and the thing with the artifact made his mind a little narrow to let Luna go out of his sight.\n'Am I becoming an idiot in love...'\nEven though he thought that, there was a gentle smile on his face as it seemed he accepted being silly since the person in question was his precious Luna.\nBringing his left hand over her fluffy hair, Austin tilted his head and whispered his immediate thoughts in a soothing tone.\n\"Is my over-protective self, not acceptable?\"\n*BA*DUM*\nLuna's heart leaped in beats as she saw the gentle gaze of her beloved blended with such sweet, tempting words, turning her face amber in an instant.\nShe softly bit her lower lip as she stared at Austin with a hazy gaze.\nHer breathing became slightly heavy and unrhythmic, as she sensed Austin advancing his face toward her.\nSoon his hot breath reached up to her as she smelt the mixed fragrance of mint, signifying how near he had arrived.\nIf it was any other time, then she might have jumped on him, but for some reason, the current Austin was dangerous for her heart.\nSo she played maiden and closed her eyes, as she waited for the final result, but....\n**KNOCK**X6\nSix consecutive heavy knocks rang from the door, before Luna glared at it, with her mood instantly turning sour.\nBut to her utmost surprise, a rough warm hand, grabbed her chin, and with a slight pull, a warm sensation spread on her lips.\nWith her eyes widened, Luna saw two emerald orbs warmly gazing into her oceanic eyes.\nLuna instantly closed her lids, as she felt Austin cupping her cheeks before he deepened their kiss to a further extent.\nThe knocks kept banging on the door, but Austin never halted his movements, and with his face slightly tilted, he enjoyed the sensation of Luna's fluffy and supple lips, which always tempted him to suck on them.\nThe wet sounds of their intimate lip-locking echoed, which got suppressed by the knocks, as Austin played with her either lips by taking his time.\nHer fruitful taste, her softness, and the warm sensation which spread on her face, made him enthralled to do something more, but the time wasn't right.\nSeparating his lips slowly, Austin saw Luna huffing audibly with her face completely flushed from head to chin.\nAustin knew if he looked for more than a second at her face now, then he might lose his calm, so instantly, he got up and went to open the door.\n\"Ah!\"\nSicily, who was continuously knocking on the door, became startled when it abruptly swung.\n\"What?\"\nIn normal circumstances, Austin might have flared up on Sicily, but right now, he was in a very colorful mood.\nUpon seeing Austin's current expression, Sicily fell into a daze, but soon she shook her head and confessed her concern hurriedly.\n\"Kyou-kun! He...he went to buy something from the down market, and he....\"\nAustin's eyes stretched as he realized what she was saying, before he darted away from the room.\n'This idiot!!!'\n________________________\n[Some minutes ago]\n[Around the place where the group of four has been staying]\nAs the sun peeked from the horizon and daybreak illuminated the surface, Kyouki felt like moving out of the shelter and roaming in the market for the time being.\nAnd since he wanted to eat something, too, he told Sicily that he would be checking the downtown market for a bit.\nSicily was reluctant to let him go, so she placed the Vitality Thread on him so that she could be assured of his safety.\nCurrently, the raven-haired handsome youth was venturing into the lively early morning market while munching on a fresh apple.\nThe surrounding was getting busier passing each second, with shops lifting their shutters and town people leaving their house to go to their work.\nIn a sense, it reminded Kyouki of the town where he grew up.\nThis simplicity, this harmonious atmosphere, and the lovely calmness made his morning unforgettable.\n\"Please, don't break my store! I beg you, Onii-san.\"\nSuddenly Kyouki's ear perked with a childish voice from not so far.\nRedirecting his gaze, he found a group of men wearing ragged clothes and cuts on their faces, breaking the outer structure of a bread shop.\nA small girl was pleading with her hands joined in front of the men, with tears flowing out of her eyes.\nKyouki's breathing became heavy as he subconsciously mushed the remaining apple before he moved his feet toward the scene.\n\"Hey, assholes!\"\nKyouki shouted at the top of his lungs, which gathered the attention of the onlookers as well as the goons who were breaking the shop too.\n\"Eh? Ye fed up of living..heh?\"\nOne of them glared at Kyouki with murderous intent covering his demeanor.\nBut it wasn't enough to make the hero surrender, as he moved his feet at an inhuman speed, much to the goons' astonishment, before two heavy blows resonated in the surrounding.\n\"Khwhak!\"\n\"What the...\"\nBoth of them fell to the ground while clutching their torso as a single heavy blow was enough to push them off the edge.\n\"Can you even call yourself a man after hurting such an innocent life?\"\nKyouki's eyes were devoid of any emotion as he felt loath toward the group who evidently were committing such sin, which required more than a punch.\nBut he forgot that there was a third one too who was still turned toward the store until now.\n\"What a statement. It almost sounded like what a hero would say.\"\nHearing the word, 'Hero, ' Kyouki became flustered as he turned his eyes to the front and saw that the little girl wasn't there anymore, before he felt a tremendous amount of intent pouring down his consciousness and surrendering him to kneel.\n\"Khak!!

      "content": "\"Did you find him?\"\nAs Austin returned, Sicily got up and immediately barged for any news about Kyouki.\nAustin, whose hair was raven, now signifying that he had used the herb to not look suspicious in the market, shook his head with a sigh.\n\"A ruckus did occur an hour ago, and from what I have heard, Kyouki must have gotten involved in it.\"\nAustin muttered to the bed as he plopped down beside Luna, who had a solemn expression spread across her face. But deep down, she was extremely frustrated because of Kyouki's action, which definitely would raise problems in the plan.\nThe air around Sicily oozed with worry and concern for Kyouki as more than the plan or anything else; she was worried about his whereabouts.\nAs for Austin...\n\"Well, there's no point crying over the spilled milk. Now we have to think before we move.\"\nHe was so calm and collected at the moment, that even Luna became baffled, not to talk about Sicily, who feared to face Austin's rage.\n\"You...leave it. What do you have in mind, Austin?\"\nLuna halted her words, before she asked what concerned her most at the moment.\nSicily also looked at Austin in a way like he was her last hope who could help her regain Kyouki.\n\"Kyouki, despite being not much powerful in comparison to Alex or Sir Charles, was still a hero of light. From what I know, the military of Xylex isn't capable of restraining him. Then the only option left is....\"\n\"The summoned heroes.\"\nLuna completed his words, on which Austin only nodded before he continued with his words.\n\"Well, in a way, we know that rumours about The Summoned Heroes aren't just rumours. And since that Vitality Thread is still intact, it means that Kyouki has been taken, hostage.\"\nSicily nearly forgot that she had the thread in her hand, which tells the condition of the other half bearer. Some strings have died down, which said that Kyouki was injured but still in good condition.\nShe heaved a sigh of relief, as she also plopped down on the chair before she heard Austin continuing.\n\"Well, I am 99 percent sure that Kyouki has been taken by Capital's guard but to be on the safe side...Luna, can you track him?\"\nWithout responding, Luna went to work as soon as her eyes were illuminated with a cyan hue.\nIt didn't take long before her oceanic eyes returned, along with a negative answer.\n\"No, I can't. Something is blocking my senses after a definite reach.\"\nLuna had a profound expression on her face as she said her concerns. It wasn't the first time she was restricted like this, and neither time had she had a good premonition about it.\n\"Well, that is understandable since Xylex works with demons and their cursed items.\"\nIt sounds absurd every time they remember how a nation was able to co-operate with those beings who know no obedience and considers humanity as their nemesis.\nAustin suddenly got up from the bed, attracting the gaze of the ladies before he took out something from the inventory and threw it inside his mouth.\n\"A-Austin? What about tracking Kyou-kun?\"\nSicily asked hurriedly as she was suffering from anxiety passing each second.\n\"Am *nom**nom* af if...\"\n(A/N:-  I am at it)\nDue to the heavy load inside his mouth, Austin's voice became slightly funny, which made Luna giggle. Austin playfully glared at Luna, which the latter ignored entirely.\nSicily, looked at the flirting couple with her eyes twitching before finally, her patience resulted in something meaningful.\n**SPIT**\n**GUFUU**\nAs soon Austin spat the thing, he was chewing, a white cloud formed at that place.\nSicily and Luna looked at the scene with curious gazes before a small brown figure emerged out of the cloud.\n**Baff*Baff*\nWith its short tail wagging left to right, a small dog of the size of fewer than 50 centimeters appeared at the spot as it stared at its master with a joyful gaze.\n\"\"Awwwww\"\"\nIf only Sicily would have reacted like this, then it would have been understandable, but Luna being so expressive about something made Austin startled.\nBoth of the beautiful women went straight to pet the tiny creature, which they hadn't seen until now.\nThe little being, too, accepted its master's acquaintance with its eyes closed and tail unstoppably swaying left to right.\nAustin rubbed his eyes with a heavy sigh, before his voice reached up to the trio.\n\"Come here.\"\nThe creature, just like a remote control device, left the parts of the two onee-san and marched toward Austin.\nAustin looked at the dog before his eyes focused on the two maidens in front, who had their gaze still fixed on the creature like they had found their new obsession.\n\"Hello, guys? Remember, Kyouki, summoned heroes, Xylex? Does it rings any bell?\"\nLuna, as well as Sicily, came out of their stupor as they saw Austin's frown, much to their fret.\n\"Seriously. Anyway, Sicily bring me something which had Kyouki's scent. We will go hero hunting now.\"\n______________________\nAt the same time, when the trio and a newly added member initiated their search for the hero, two peculiar men walked steadily in a dimly lighted hall.\nThe place was by no mean extravagant or luxurious, which one could expect from a hall built inside the palace.\nThere were guards aligned by the wall who motionlessly stood at their place even though the Emperor was walking through the foyer.\n\"You sure that Saintess would come after this defective hero?\"\nThe one who spoke with a sneer was the spiky red-headed, summoned being, Yuuske.\n\"I don't know if it is true or not, but the saint is in a relationship with the Light Hero, so she must come.\"\nA wide grin spread across Yuuske's face as he thought about the rumored beauty of Saintess, who was the most charming woman in the nation of Gram.\n'Well, until Mina doesn't accept me, I might enjoy something fresh and raw instead?'\nWith such wicked thoughts, the duo proceeded further inside the hall, which, in actuality, was an underground prison where Yuuske have stored Kyouki.\nThe metal bars showed the figure of a boy in his mid-teens, currently being bound with two chains as his upper body looked completely ragged with tens of blood marks and bruises all over.\n\"Why did you beat him up? He might become nation's asset in future.\"\nThannath glared at the carefree man, who shrugged his shoulder before answering.\n\"That kid ain't any hero. I just did what I felt like.\"\nThannath soon left the matter since he knew how crazy-minded Yuuske was, to begin with.\nInstead, with a profound expression, he almost pleaded the hero with the concern which was making Thannath, worried the most.\n\"Whatever you do, keep the monster with Saintess alive. He alone handled a whole army of demons single-handedly. So by hook or crook, you have to take him to our side, understand?\"\n__________________\nA/N:- Well, let's just pray for the new hero now.",

      "content": "In a semi-crowded street, three suspicious figures could be seen striding through people as they followed a small creature, that was attracting more attention than the trio.\nIt's already been three hours since Kyouki disappeared, and the three started their journey to find him.\nThere couldn't use levitation since the creature couldn't track its target in mid-air, and also, the [Camouflage] Luna has drawn upon themselves would become vulnerable in the skies.\nSo walking on foot was the last option.\n\"These things are clinging so much to my body.\"\nSicily grumbled again as she complained about the pants, that Austin gave her, for the third time.\nSince it was something Austin took out of his inventory, it goes without saying, that it wouldn't be just a pair of pants.\nBut the ojou-sama, who had only worn elegant skirts and gowns until now, was having trouble wearing men's apparel, all of a sudden.\n\"Don't complain or run naked.\"\nLuna growled in annoyance as Sicily was whining unnecessarily. She also had some kind of attire, with frill centered white shirt and black high-waist pants, but looking at Luna's fluent movement, it seemed she was used to wearing it.\nSicily teared up in grief as she closed her mouth and followed behind the two.\n\"We are nearing. Spread your senses.\"\nSuddenly the look of annoyance and misery on the two ladies' faces disappeared as they heard Austin's remark, before they did what the man asked for.\nThe reason why Austin was able to conclude that they were nearing the capital, was the lessen populace around the vicinity.\nXylex capital was built in two parts. The first was distributed to commoners and traders along with low-ranking nobles, in which Austin and co. were staying last night.\nThe upper town contained the main palace along with the residence of high-ranking nobles and also, and the main Cathedral was built here.\nThe two towns were connected in more than one way, which helped Austin, Luna, and Sicily to blend in the crowd and approach the higher end, comfortably.\n\"Hey, stop!\"\nAfter reaching a certain point, Austin halted the dog since it was moving forward while sniffing the path, constantly.\nThe reason why Austin stopped it was because in front of the group was a lean bridge made of castle stones with two guards standing on either side of the entrance.\nBeneath and beside the bridge was a lake with apparent blue water spread like a serene sheet, and unlike the upper town from which they passed by, this place was utterly unpopulated.\nThe trio stood at a distance where the guards and any other surveillance wouldn't have been able to see them.\nKeeping a look out of their surrounding, Austin asked in a calm tone.\n\"Luna...is it the same for now too ?\"\nLuna bit her lower lip in frustration as she felt so useless for the second time in her life, before responding to her beloved.\n\"Yeah. Something is blocking all my senses after a certain point. I am sorry, Austin.\"\nSeeing her downcast expression, Austin smiled gently, before he brought his hand above her head and spoke lovingly.\n\"Don't apologize, Luna. I know how it feels when you have the capability yet can't utilize it, but we have to think straight here since this won't be the last thing, I will ask you today.\"\nLuna, upon hearing such considerate remarks from the person whose words matter most to her, became a little calmer as she smiled with a nod.\nSicily wasn't trying to eavesdrop on their lovey-dovey conversation, but since she was so close to them, she couldn't miss the part in which Austin spoke about himself, which naturally made her remember some of the things from the past.\nThe pink atmosphere remained only for some moments before; Austin directed his gaze upon the green-eyed girl.\n\"Sicily, do you have any way to peek inside without getting found out?\"\nUpon hearing Austin's subjective remark, Sicily frowned slightly.\n\"Why do I feel like, you know about me more than I am aware of?\"\n[Ding!]\n[+100: Villain's Point]\n[The plot has been slightly altered by your interference.]\nAustin suppressed his smile and shrugged his shoulder in response to Sicily.\nThe receiver of such an aloof response fell into contemplation but not for long as she extended her hand toward Austin.\n\"What?\"\n\"Give me that staff.\"\nAustin remembered what she was talking about, before he grabbed the thing from inside the inventory and passed it to the excited girl.\n\"Wahh!\"\nSicily was almost seemed to be jumping in elation as she finally reunited with her beloved partner in crime. Hugging the mage staff dearly, Sicily gave an accomplished look.\nLuna was glaring at the scene because of not being aware of the whole event which happened back in the Eden Academy.\n\"*Ahem* Please don't tell Kyou-kun about this spell at all, or I won't be able to show my face in front of him.\"\nBoth Luna and Austin were aware of why Sicily said such a thing, so they kept their mouth shut before Sicily finally began to work.\nClosing her eyes, a strange greenish hue covered the mage-warrior before some movement happened on the middle of her forehead.\n**SQUELCH**\nLike muscle being torn, the flesh on Sicily's center forehead parted before a small eye came into existence.\nThe eye , unlike usual, wasn't vertical in shape but rather horizontal, with a thin black pupil moving around restlessly.\nIt took almost five minutes for Sicily to establish the network between the third eye and her consciousness before she widened her perception and took the survey inside the palace.\nVery soon, a deep frown contoured her beautiful face as it seemed she saw something seemingly horrible.\nComing back to herself, the third eye disappeared from her forehead before Sicily parted her lids and spoke in a serious tone.\n\"There isn't any army of humans or demons; instead, what stood guarding the palace is just a single man.\"\nLuna's expression also turned severe as she heard the cause of her senses of restriction, which didn't help but leave her with sourness.\n\"Anything more about that person?\"\nIt was Austin who asked, and by his expression, it seemed he was expecting such a thing to be the case.\n\"To be honest, I never had seen such tremendous mana presence from anyone, which that man was reeking with. I can't be sure, but it seems that he was above any of the demons who came to attack Eden Academy.\"\nUpon hearing that the vanguard was a man but not a woman, Austin concluded that this wasn't the person whom the ramen shop owner mentioned as demigod ranked.\nBut the main trouble was, the whereabouts of that female summoned hero. Since another Summoned being was in charge of guarding the palace, this only meant a single thing...\n'Emperor Thannath is taking us lightly....'\nAustin fell into contemplation about the next move, for a long minute before it seemed he finally drew his conclusion.\n\"Sicily, take this.\"\n\"Ah..\"\nAustin threw a white pearl-like pill toward the baffled girl, before he started narrating what he have thought....\n\"Listen carefully. This pill will help you avoid any kind of surveillance, appraiser, or high-level detection spell, for an hour. After Luna and I draw out every hidden arsenal from Xylex, you have to infiltrate inside and find Kyouki, understand?\"\nThere were various things to register, but in the end, Sicily just nodded with a profound expression as she clutched the pill.\n\"I won't disappoint you both.\"\nNodding, Austin turned toward the lovely raven-haired saint who looked pretty in every attire or appearance she adores, before he held her hand and spoke in a whisper.\n\"You ready?\"\nReciprocating the smile with a blend of determination in her eyes, Luna spoke in the same tone.\n\"Been since ever.\"\n____________________\nA/N:- Is it going slow paced?

      "content": "Under the bright sun, with chirps of volant and the slight rustle of cool breezes, stood a singular figure in the whole compound of the front palace.\nThe man, by appearance, looked in his early twenties with spiky crimson hair and raven dye at the edge of the tips. His facial features were of those devilish charmer types with a high nose, and seductive lip currently drew in a wide grin.\nHis two rubric eyes stared into the distant sky as the man waited for something or someone with great excitement.\nThis man was none other than Yuuske Shinma, one of the beings who have been summoned from another world to Xylex in order to accomplish something.\nYuuske, before he was summoned, lived a miserable life where he was betrayed or abandoned by everyone. Either his parents or his friends, everyone for one way or another, left his side, never to return.\nHe lived in the darkness where he feared nothing but to trust and get close to someone.\nThat's why when suddenly he found this frightening strength, with his features developing into a dangerous charm and wealth that wouldn't be exhausted even if he spent it with both hands, Yuuske became blinded.\nHe felt like the world was beneath him until he found out that there were others too, who found such fortune like him.\nBut he didn't stop there.\nSlowly yet surely, he strengthened himself, by different means, became the most influential entity of the kingdom, and eliminated everything which could have bare their fangs at him.\nHe believed that until he doesn't anger the being who had brought them here, he would become the ruler of this plain and do whatever he even never dreamt of.\nBut he was unaware of the fact that he only has become overpowered in the face of demons and people he has met until now.\nThe real catastrophe has yet to come...\n...\n\"Ah, you guys are finally here. I was about to run havoc in the town to search the Sai....\"\nYuuske's words came to a halt as his eyes landed on the raven-haired woman beside the man, who, just with one look, made Yuuske go speechless.\nHis eyes were drawn entirely up to her as he ignored the presence other than the beauty whose rumor didn't fail his expectancy.\nSince Yuuske knew that the Saint of Gram was widely known for her peculiar Silver hair, he concluded that she must have been wearing some artifact or had consumed some herbs.\nBut even with the midnight crown, Yuuske felt his heart racing just upon catching a glimpse of her perfect figure and slim waist, which urged him to go forth and hold her at this instance.\nThe tight-fitting of her pants exposed how fine meaty, and fluffy her thighs were. Not to talk about her bust, which Yuuske found unfairly big for someone belonging to that age. All in all, her body made him extremely enthralled.\nYuuske shamelessly eyed Luna all over, but just avoided her eyes. It wasn't that the Saint was looking at him with disgust; instead, her oceanic eyes contained no emotions at all.\nHe avoided that gaze since it reminded him of a certain woman who he had been pursuing for months now.\n\"You do look more beautiful than I had heard, Saint-sama.\"\nYuuske bowed with an honest compliment, but in response, he heard nothing. But since he wasn't hoping for anything in return, he got back up instantly.\nFinally turning his head toward the emerald-eyed boy beside the beauty, Yuuske raised his finger before asking in an innocent tone.\n\"Umm...I was informed that I would be facing a Saint and A monster. But you are a kid tho...you sure you didn't let someone like your Onii-chan, behind?\"\nYuuske, this time, hoped to hear some hot-blooded threats or at least some agitated reaction from the boy, just like the hero he captured this morning.\nBut then again...\n'What's up with this weird duo.'\nYuuske found it annoying to see the scene progressing so blandly. Concluding that the two intruders weren't going to talk, Yuuske decided to finalize the matter and wrap up for the day.\n\"Okay, here's the deal. Hand over the saint and we will give your broken hero back and even let you run away from the terri-\"\n**SWISSH**\n**BOOOOOOM**\nSuddenly the figure of Austin disappeared from his spot like he was an illusion. With a pace that might defy the eyes of the highest ranking appraiser, he launched toward the blabbering man before landing a tightly held punch right at the center of Yuuske's face.\nAn uneven dent formed on Catles' wall where Yuuske crashed just after three seconds of being hit. The distance between his initial and final positions was more than two hundred meters, so one could imagine how heavy, Austin landed the blow.\nYuuske's eyes were always open since he felt the unavoidable blow. With a wide grin, he wiped the drops of blood spilling out of his nose before he got out of the crater.\nStretching his body and cracking the tensed muscle, Yuuske spoke enthusiastically.\n\"Omoshiroi~ So the rumors about Gram weren't all false, huh? Well, since you landed the first blood, I hope you can handle the consequences.\"\nSaying so, Yuuske's aura started to overflow with a strange kind of energy with, his eyes glittering with murderous intent as he maniacally looked at his target, before muttering under his breath.\n\"Leme show you what a true hero is capable of...\"\n_____________________\nAt the same time when all this ordeal was undergoing, somewhere far away, a more profound event had already taken place.\nBurning trees, broken walls, and injured people, made the surroundings look like it had faced a massive war and hadn't recovered from the after effect.\nBut only the sufferers knew that this disastrous result happened just because of a single human.\n\"Khwak!\"\nAs the person responsible for this catastrophe on Eden Academy, lifted the red-haired warrior Venessa, the victim struggled to breathe properly.\n\"Where's Saint Luna Lastov?\"\n(A/N:- Luna uses a fake surname to hide her real identity.)\nVanessa, with her one eye bruised and the other one focused on the raven-haired bitch woman, growled under her breath for being so hopeless before she shouted in rage.\n\"F-fuck of-\"\n**DHAK**\nThe woman didn't wait to hear Venessa's curse before throwing the pitiful warrior to the ground before she lost her consciousness.\nExamining around the vicinity, the woman eyed the whole surrounding but wasn't able to find a single useful person who could help her find the Saint she had come to take Xylex.\nSuddenly the woman heard someone's voice from far above before a figure came into her heightened vision.\n\"May I help you, lady?\"\nDescended at a steady pace was a bespectacled purple-robed man in his thirties, as he finally landed his feet just some feet apart from the woman.\n'Sir Charles would be super mad....'\nAlex drew a mana circle and used as much healing as he could on the senseless Venessa, who still hadn't recovered from the battle with the demons.\nThe eyes of the woman didn't waver even though Alex was actively healing the girl, since it didn't concern her at all.\nWith her voice taking a colder blend, she gave away her judgment.\n\"Speak before I turn this place into a graveyard.\"\n_______________________\nA/N:- Drop a comment~",

      "content": "**SPRT**\nOn a broken ground with rumbles of stones and craters deforming the surface, stood two men while facing each other.\nOne of them had a neat appearance with raven hair adorning his head and a calm demeanor wearing his aura as he stood solemnly like he wasn't a contender of what just some seconds ago.\nThe other one had a more profound expression on his face as he spat blood once in a while as he bled from various corners, actively.\nVitality from his rubric eyes seemed to have exhausted away, as the man faced such blows and unavoidable hits from his opponent, that the initial thoughts of wrapping up for the day, felt to be prolonged more than he expected.\n\"You really are good for someone to be at that age, eh? You sure, aren't chya the real hero or somethin?\"\nYuuske asked in a hoarse tone as he gawked intently at the teenage boy who had made him remember what pain was, after so long.\nHe, who has dreamt of becoming the mightiest being, whom no one could ever be able to defy, has taken damage from a mere brat?!\n'Unacceptable!'\nSuddenly, Yuuske's whole aura started to turn heavier with his eyes regaining the glint which oozed with murderous intent. A peculiar golden magical essence started enveloping his body, seeming to signify the activation of some kind of spell.\n\"Enhancer!!!\"\nAs the shout left Yuuske's mouth, he darted at Austin at a completely different pace, denying all the stats he had shown until now.\nOnly five seconds and Yuuske was positioned on Austin's back with both his palms clasped and ready to turn Austin's head into a bloody pulp.\n\"Die!!\"\n**BOOOOOOOM**\nA massive cloud of dust broke out after an ear-numbing shockwave erupted from the place centered on Austin.\nThe land around that area was, despite being covered with the hue, evidently turned into a massive excavation as Yuuske landed his blow, using his strength to the fullest.\nLuna, who was still near the bridge end, felt her heart leaping slightly as the hit indeed was terrifying for even her to stay calm. But she didn't go to help since she knew Austin was, by all means, fine.\n\"!!!\"\nWhen Yuuske didn't feel the hot liquid, he was expecting after opening Austin's skull with his attack; his eyes widened in shock.\nAnd more to it, when Yuuske's vision cleared from the dust, what he saw, made him flabbergasted beyond belief.\n\"You really do talk a lot.\"\nFor the first time, Austin's voice leaked out before the rubric-eyed hero felt a massive life-threatening intent pouring down his consciousness.\nWith his forearm still blocking Yuuske's adjoined blow, Austin clenched his fist and covering it with [Hell Blaze]; he punched Yuuske's torso without exerting much of force.\nWell, that was a held-back punch from Austin's perspective...\n\"KHWAAAAAK!\"\nYuuske's eyes turned white for a moment as the fatal impact on his torso, which nearly took away his life with it.\nBut he wasn't provided with much leisure to even get over the after effect, before Yuuske felt his wrist being held in a rigid grip with unbreakable strength.\nWith his palm wide spread, Austin didn't give a single shit what was happening with this self-claimed hero, before the teenage youth started showering the man with heavy slaps.\n**THWACK**\nEach hit was worthy of putting a lower Unique rank Demon into eternal slumber. The sharp noise of flesh hitting flesh made even Luna cringe as Austin continued beating the hero mercilessly.\n\"STO *slap* STOP IT *THAK*\"\nThe most crucial part of Austin's rain of blows was, that he only targeted Yuuske's left side of his face, resulting in a swollen mess.\nAfter what seemed like an eternity for Yuuske and those who were watching things from the background, Austin finally got done with his chain of slaps; and with the last firm whack, he released Yuuske's hand.\n**DHAK**\nYuuske's body was thrown not so far away before it hit a pillar near the palace entrance.\nThe loud shrieks and painful cries finally came to a halt with a thud.\nThe battlefield was distorted as if a full-fledged war had occurred in such a small arena.\nThe expression on Thannath's face wasn't very significant as he saw the scene in front.\nFrom start to end, he could only catch one thing, which was how miserably Yuuske was getting beaten down by the raven-haired youth.\nThannath knew that his strongest warrior was the female hero who had gone to Gram currently, but he didn't have any fewer hopes from his second best either.\nHe has spent fortunes for Yuuske, after all.\n'Damn it!'\nGritting his yellowish teeth, Thannath spoke agitatedly toward his minister.\n\"Send Reinforcement.\"\n\"But my lord. Yuuske-sama said-\n\"I don't give a fuck what that weak ass bastard said! Do what I say and capture that Saint before the matter could grow any severe.\"\nThe minister became flustered being scolded by the king, before he bowed and darted away to his full capability.\nWith a heavy sigh, Thannath faced the front as with a frown, he muttered, under his breath.\n\"Let's see how long you can endure.\"\n...\nBack on the battlefield, Austin sensed something massive approaching just by the change in the flow of mana, but since he didn't have any artifact to resist spell formation, he let whatever was happening.\nThe castle door finally parted after so many deathly exchanges before a group of men wearing church robes and black-cladded warriors stepped out.\nBy mana evaluation, Austin concluded that no one was above the Veteran Rank. But what gave him this strange vibe was something else...something more ominous.\n'Oh..so that's why...'\nAppeared were two dark reddish portals just on either side where Yuuske landed earlier before some specific figures started walking out of those gateways.\nThe priests who came from inside the palace also focused on healing their hero with the guards working as a barricade around him.\nThose who appeared with heavy miasma overflowing out of them were undoubtedly demons of mixed Class of Terror and Unique.\nThe amount of demons were so many in number, that the whole atmosphere started turning dark, with clouds disappearing behind the haze.\nAustin was a little anxious about the scene since Kyouki hadn't been retrieved yet, but he knew standing there would result in nothing.\nBut just before he was about to take a step forward and land his first blow, someone hugged him from his back.\nAustin concluded that there was none on the battlefield who could have reached up to him without getting noticed, other than a single beautiful person.\n\"Master~Austin~ Won't you let Luna have some share of fun while you admire her beauty on the battlefield?\"\nSpoke in a seductive tone was the person whose voice he could recognize even in sleep.\nFor the first time after arriving at the Xylex main palace, a smile made its way to Austin's handsome face before he nodded with his reply.\n\"My eyes will only be on you.\"\n\"So I better do it in the most flashy way~.\"\nSaying, so Luna let go of Austin before she stepped forward.\nWhat her parting words actually meant, would be realized by Austin very soon, and when he would, he might realize what side of Luna he actually was unaware of, until now...\n____________________\nA/N:- Leme know if you liked the chap~",

      "content": "Since childhood, Austin only has come to respect two people based on their strength and capability.\nThe first one is the Grand Master Merlin Finser, the one and only headmaster of Eden's Academy since anyone could remember. The Saint Ranked mage does contain that potential that gained him the name engraved in the golden history of Gram and also built an admirable image in Austin's memory.\nThe second is the Knight Commander of the Royal Order, Charles Sinton. The war god had experienced so many deathly battles throughout his life that had instilled a fear in other nations, that if they wanted to harm Gram, they had to face this battle maniac first.\nAustin has felt natural admiration toward these aforementioned beings, but that was until now...\n**CREEEK**\n\"!!!\"\nThe hair strands on Austin's arm stood up as he stared at the scene in front.\nIt's been only ten minutes...\nTen freakin minutes!!\nAnd Luna have turned the battlefield which was already in a distorted condition, into a complete graveyard of demons.\nWhatever walked out of the portal regardless they were Unique ranked or Terror. Either they were volant creatures or underground threats; nothing survived.\nThe mixture of Elemental, Spiritual, and Inheritance types of formation sparkled from Luna's ascended figure as she dominated the battlefield with the sheer use of raw mana.\nDue to the fact that there wasn't any Blessing Snatcher involved in the battle, she was able to draw out her true potential, while remaining unfazed even though she was using that absurd amount of magical energy.\nNot to talk about her coquettish laugh in between the battle, which would have sounded seductive if not for life she was seizing past each second.\n\"Fuck...\"\n**RUMBLE**\nAustin couldn't help but exclaim upon seeing the earth-shattering thunder raining down from the sky as Luna fried down seven Terror Ranked demons in one go.\nEven Austin requires a minute to put a Terror Demon into sleep unless he doesn't use his artifact and spiritual blessings. And here, the saint who was known for being caring and motherly by nature was pulverizing the demons like they were mere ants.\nTo say, Austin was shocked would be an understatement. He indeed was proud of being the lover of such a talented warrior, but the dread of angering Luna in the future rose steadily inside his mind.\n'Well, she won't kill me even if I were to anger her...right?'\nShrugging his unnecessary thoughts, Austin turned his head toward the group of men who had long lost their vitality because of the fear; Luna unintentionally instilled in them.\nOnly a single Veteran Rank pope was healing Yuuske back to health, while sweating profoundly.\nCatching Austin's gaze, Yuuske pushed the pope away as he intently glared at the raven-haired youth.\nYuuske was indeed frightened beyond belief upon feeling Austin's might, and now when he caught a glimpse of what this rumored Saint was capable of, he had already lost hope of winning this battle...\n....In his human form.\n'Well, better than dying..'\nThinking to himself, Yuuske brought up a small purple pill that was oozing with condensed demonic energy.\nAustin saw the ordeal, but he didn't have much time to proceed since he might come in Luna's way, so Austin stood right at his point and let the hero do whatever he desired in his final moments.\nYuuske sneered at the weak response, before he threw the pill inside his mouth while keeping his gaze fixed on Austin.\n'Blame your luck, bastard, for pushing me to this point...'\nThinking at his final instants as a human, Yuuske felt a massive surge of strange energy penetrating every part of his body, overtaking his mana and hijacking his senses.\n\"KHAK!\"\nDropping on his left knee, Yuuske saw his hand bulging before his limbs started expanding dangerously. His armor started tearing up as soon his whole body converted into a savage state.\nCrimson condensed blood covered his whole body, with the previous handsome feature changing into a distorted shape as Yuuske's overall size bulged disturbingly.\n\"KUAK! KHAAAK!\"\nThe tone of growls shifted to a heavier phase as the small human frame, converted into a humungous 5-meter demon with limbs similar to humans yet massive to be called humane.\nHis head was now bald, with two sharp fangs protruding from the lower jaw. The previous amber eye was turned into a maroon without any sign of fixed pupil, as the formerly handsome man wholly turned into a crimson monster.\n\"UOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHH\"\nFormer summoned hero, roared in agitation, sending tremors throughout the battlefield as it took his massive step forward.\nAustin also walked only a foot when both demon and Austin halted because of varying reasons.\nThe demon stopped because his body was restricted with pure mana to even let his single finger move. And the reason Austin halted...\n\"Sorry, darling. Just a second, and I will wrap this up.\"\nLuna's beautiful hair, which had regained its original peculiar shade, swayed freely in mid-air as she pleaded Austin to wait for some time since she didn't want to interrupt him mid-fight.\nAustin raised his brows for some reason, before he nodded for Luna to continue.\nLuna smiled before landing between the crimson demon and her beloved, as soon her eyes got covered with a cyan hue.\n[Hymn of Celeria]\nA small vortex, with a whirlwind actively erupting out of it, formed on Luna's palm as she stood calmly at her spot while maintaining the mana terrifyingly.\nWith a smirk, she released the vortex toward the two portals from where the new group of demons was about to exit.\nThe whirlpool of greenish-blue wind engulfed the demon along with the whole two significant gateways before everything disappeared within a moment.\nThe whole thing only took twenty-second as Luna turned toward Austin with a big grin on her face.\nAustin's lips twitched as he thought, why didn't Luna use such a spell since the start? Then again, the way she expectantly came up to him, he could not just break her heart, could he?\n\"How was I?\"\nLuna's face was slightly red due to the overuse of mana, but other than that, she was completely fine, both mentally and physically.\nAustin sighed with a smile, before bringing his hand over the shy Luna as he praised her.\n\"Hai..hai. My Luna is the best.\"\n\"Hmmm~\"\nLuna giggled with a toothy smile plastered on her charming face as she enjoyed the pats of Austin.\n**GUOOOOOHHH**\nAnother loud roar erupted from the only demon available on the ground, which made Luna extremely annoyed.\n\"Should I dispose of this one too, darling?\"\nLuna immediately chanted a spell and was about to release it toward the demon, before Austin stopped her.\n\"No, Luna. If it would have before he had eyed you with such a disgusting gaze, then I would have let you take him down. But now...\"\nLuna's eyes widened in surprise as she blinked at her darling, who seemed to be more handsome currently, as his aura grew fiercer before he concluded his words.\n\"Now, it's personal.\"\n____________________\nA/N:- I will wrap up the fight in the next chapter, promise.\nAnd did you guys like the way Luna calls him now?\nLeme know in the comments~",

      "content": "In a thinly lighted hall could be seen a feminine figure of a raven-haired woman as she stealthily made her way inside the palace of Xylex, without letting her presence become evitable with her steps.\nThe pill she got from Austin, helped Sicily, avoid the sensors and those who were guarding the indoor palace. Fortunately, there weren't many guards left inside the castle doors, and the disaster outside has kept the residuals occupied.\nSicily currently had a slightly pale face as after all the reinforcement arrived on the battlefield; then only she infiltrated the fortress.\nNaturally, she witnessed the brutal strength Austin displayed to overwhelm the battlefield while facing Yuuske. But since she already has seen how Austin fights back in Eden Academy, she wasn't frightened by him to the extent she was showcasing right now.\nWhat made Sicily bathe in a cold sweat was the traumatizing might that the woman displayed, who was known to be a Saint Healer, yet inflicted irreversible damage on her enemies, just contrary to her title.\nIf Sicily didn't had seen it with her own eyes, she might never have believed that Luna could be so ruthless and overpowering in battle. The blend of different kinds of mana channels and how she redirected it, made Sicily believe that she was by no means comparable to her.\n'I better take my Kyou-kun far away from her...'\nThinking so, Sicily fastened her feet and walked toward the direction from where Kyouki's energy was faintly leaking out.\n____________________\nBack on the battlefield, the sky was still dark due to the miasma leaking out of the dead bodies of the demons, stood three figures varying in the race.\nTwo of them were humans, and the third has lost his humanity, some minutes ago.\nLuna was sitting on the wall by the bridge end as she kept her gaze fixed on her beloved darling with a smile never leaving her face.\nAustin was facing the distorted red demon with his eyes solely focused on his enemy as he waited patiently for it to move.\nThe demon, after getting liberated from Luna's bind, was already so much agitated that it didn't let Austin wait for long before it conjured a black orb on top of its massive palm, which was purple lightning sparkling all over.\n(A/N:- Yuuske(demon)= 'It.')\nThe black orb was indeed made up of raw curse energy that only an actual demon could possess. But an entity that was previously human and wasn't born like this using curse powers, made Austin a little perplexed. Nevertheless, he kept it aside for now, and awaited the blow to be released.\nWith a high-pitched roar, the crimson monster released the orb, which grew up to seven feet in diameter, toward the raven-haired youth.\n\"UGOOOHH!\"\nThe dark orb broke the surface as a trail from where it passed and moved toward Austin. The sphere was by no mean agile since it could have been traced with normal human eyes, but the dark energy it was releasing and the impact it would inflict, could have put a whole town into eternal slumber.\nBut despite sensing such energy, Austin didn't waver from his footing, and raising his hand just when the orb was some feet apart from him; he activated a specific part of his spell.\n\"[Gluttony]\"\nSuddenly a black ink shadow erupted from the center of Austin's palm like it was freed from a long restrain before the unshaped shadow covered the whole curse energy along with the globe and disappeared from existence.\n\"Feuh~ Impressive, darling~.\"\nLuna, in a bizarre yet energetic mood, shouted in praise like she was enjoying the show her beloved was displaying.\nAustin smiled wryly as he concluded that Luna indeed was mana drunk before he sensed the demon again releasing a heavy mass of curse energy toward him.\nThis time not only one but two dark orbs of the same density glided toward Austin only to get eaten by his spell.\nThe demon who, formerly named Yuuske, launched these deadly spheres on Austin in hopes of pushing the human to his limit, while repeating its attacks restlessly.\nAustin's Gluttony was indeed a powerful energy-oriented spell negater, but there was a limit where he could absorb with his current physique.\nDisappearing from his spot by utilizing the agility stats he has accumulated until now, Austin got out of the barrage of attacks and appeared just above the bald head of the demon.\n**DHAAK**\nUsing his adjoined palms as a hammer, Austin landed a trembling blow on the demon's crown but to no avail.\nAs expected of a demon whose aura was evidently higher than the second degree of Terror Rank. Its head was still intact, without even a dent.\nAustin's eyes were still unfazed as this much was in his capability.\nRaising his right hand, Austin blocked the incoming punch of the demon, without much trouble.\n**DHAK**\nAn audible shockwave was generated from the collision of the big fist with Austin's bare palm, but the halt was so brutal that the creature couldn't move even an inch further.\nWith Austin's left hand still on its crown, he channelized his mana and conjured one of his elemental spells.\n[Infernous]\nLike a curtain of flames, the whole figure of the crimson demon got covered in Austin's most proficient spell.\nHowever, it seemed that the creature's skin was a lot thicker than it appeared. Even Austin didn't use his harshest degree of flames, it still could have blown away a horde of Unique ranked demons.\n\"GUOOOOOOOO\"\nRoaring like a beast, the demon threw his forelimbs in an indefinite direction, trying to attack the human anyhow.\nAustin darted away from his position before launching another set of fireballs to keep the demon busy.\n**BOOOOOM**\n**BOOOOOM**\nHeavy amount of explosions erupted with the crimson monster at the center. The ground school violently, with the mana in the air fluctuating tremendously with the chain of attacks, Austin was hurling.\nThe reason why Austin wasn't releasing the curse energy he had deposited from his gluttony was for the safety of the hero.\nThe accumulated dark energy by no means was small. From what Austin could sense, this final attack might end the monster along the whole vicinity, engulfing the entire Xylex main palace.\nThat's why he needed to be sure of Kyouki's safety, and fortunately...\n[Ding!]\n[+300 Villain's Point]\n[Host's presence has changed the Hero's destiny.]\nA wild grin formed across Austin's lips as he read the system's content, signifying that Sicily had accomplished her job, and now he finally could let loose.\nHalting his bombardment, Austin ascended in mid-air before calling out for the girl who was amusingly watching the battlefield with her oceanic eyes, never leaving Austin's figure.\n\"Luna.\"\n\"Yes, darling~.\"\n\"Created a barrier around the area. Don't let the aftereffect harm the city.\"\nLuna nodded with a smile as she loves to be useful to her darling , before she obliged with his wish~\nAustin sensing the terrifying use of mana from Luna, which she was utilizing for creating a barrier, sighed in defeat.\nFocusing his senses to the front, he cracked his knuckles before he commenced the preparation of the spell, which would become an opening to a massive upcoming event.\n'It's time to pay back.'\n_________________\nA/N: - Drop a comment~",

      "content": "\"A-Austin...Isn't it a little too much...?\"\nLuna, who was previously having a little hangover from the overuse of mana, came back to herself after witnessing the absurd length Austin had utilized inside a single spell.\nNot only did the condensed demonic energy he accumulated through his gluttony, but he also added his spiritual energy to form a single giant orb of nothing but raw mana.\nIt was a feat to accomplish itself, that Austin was able to channel the curse energy and keep it integrated along with his own spell, as the miasma was far greater for any human to endure and keep their calm.\nThe crimson demon wasn't able to move because of the ferocity he faced with the heavy showers of fireballs from Austin, and right now, its limbs were restrained with Luna's bounds.\nBut even if she didn't restrain the demon, there was no chance of it countering the thing Austin had formed in such less time.\nThe inside of the palace was dead silent itself since they knew death was nearing.\nMany tried to run away, but the barrier Luna drew didn't only suppress energy from leaking out, but it goes for humans too.\nThannath's expression, by all means, defined hopelessness.\nHis eyes were entirely drawn upon the huge dark sphere which was hanging in mid-air just above the human; he never thought to hold much threat in the first place.\nThe Emperor of the Southern Continent, was informed that the hero of Gram was a potential carrying youth who was the only one in the past two centuries to have attained the blessing of the Goddess of Light.\nThere was talk about the Saintess, too, that she has transcendental healing prowess and has a great affinity with the hero that she even subdued a Terror Rank demon in her first expedition.\nBut the news about a monster living in human flesh, who solely took all the demons sent to Gram, was still fresh, so Thannath didn't pay much attention to it.\nBut now he regrets his carelessness...\n'That damn Saint first and now this...Is this really the end for us...'\nThannath was expressionlessly looking at the dark sky, which was shadowed by the humungous orb of 10m measuring one end to another.\nIt goes without saying, that other than the Hero, Thannath has sent to Gram, no one in Xylex could face such catastrophe in the face of two humans who were shattering every expectancy and trespassing every limits a mortal should have.\nBack at Austin.\nAustin thanked Luna inwardly since she had been healing him and providing the blessing support, so he doesn't collapse due to the heavy amount of curse energy he has chanted.\nAustin wasn't able to foresee this much details that the toll on his body would become this severe.\n'It seems I have so much to learn from her...\"\nAdjusting his breath, the raven-haired youth looked at the colossal palace underneath him.\nThere were about a hundred soldiers and other nobles along with Emperor Thannath and the demon.\nAustin indeed felt bad massacring these many people, but in the end, he didn't have a system of Righteous Hero, but of a Villain's\nHe knew he had to make a tough decision in order to fulfill the desire he had been pursuing since the time he found this system.\n'I hope you get well with this, Saya...'\nMuttering under his breath, Austin finally let go of the giant orb.\nThe ground shook violently, the air trembled in real-time, and the mana from the surrounding seemed to be shaken up with the sheer shockwave of this single energy bomb, was creating.\nThe eyes of most of those who were on the ground, shut down as they awaited the miserable death they had never thought of experiencing until this morning.\nThe crimson demon, who still had some of its human wits remaining, also kneeled on the ground with fear and hopelessness hazing its eyes as death neared.\nThannath, without any peculiar thought in mind and particular emotion on his face, sat on the chair that he generally used to watch the outside scenery, but now what he asked was his demise which seemed to be inevitable at this point.\n'In the end, that guardian bastard never actually helped...'\nWhen every expectancy of Xylex's survival seemed to fade out, something unexpected happened.\n\"!!!\"\n**SLIIIING**\n**BOOOOOOOOOM**\nThe orb, which only had glided some inches down from its initial position, was cut in clean half before it detonated not so far away from Austin's front.\nAnd not only that. Before Austin could have blasted away with the shockwave, something kicked on his torso with a strength that far surpassed his own.\n\"KWHAK!\"\nWith a faint cry, Austin has blasted away like a beam of energy, before he collided with the barrier Luna has conjured around the vicinity.\n\"AUSTIN!!\"\nLuna screamed upon seeing such a shocking turn of events, before she activated her levitation to go toward him, only to be interrupted in the end.\n**SWIIIIN**\nThe tip of a lean blade approached Luna's left eye, which she was able to block with her index finger, just an inch apart.\nThe holder of the blade was thoroughly shocked to be countered in such an effortless way; nevertheless, she didn't let her mind become fuzzy as she tried to pry the tip through Luna's skin.\nThe silver-haired Saint, who was already on edge after seeing Austin getting hurt like that, felt this woman was nothing less than annoying.\n\"I don't know who- Wait aren't you the...\"\nLuna's eyes widened in utter shock as she finally got a perfect look at the face of the woman who harmed Austin just some moments ago, and now she was trying to take life of Luna.\nThe woman didn't wait to hear Luna's words, before she slanted her katana and went for the nape of her target.\nLuna sneered at such an attempt, as she held the blade before it could even have touched her, and clutched the metal hard enough to result in its crumble.\n\"!!!\"\nThe beautiful raven-haired woman made a face of utter disbelief as she stared at her broken katana like she had seen her biggest nightmare.\n\"Like I said, lets tal-\"\n\"You whore!\"\n**SLAP**\nLuna, who was trying to have a decent conversation with the woman, was unexpectedly slapped on her left cheek.\nThe woman was huffing in rage as she stared at Luna like a prey which she could put an end to, any moment now.\nWith her head tilted right, Luna stared at the ground with her eyes turning lifeless, as she spat out the blood which gushed out from her tongue.\nThis was the second time she had been slapped in her life. The man who hit her for the first time, was already in grave. Now this second time, she was thinking no less compensation at all.\n'I am sorry, Austin....'\n_____________________\nA/N:- Hey wait...I know this smell.\nOh yeah. Its time for drama muhahahahah!",

      "content": "[Luna's POV:]\nChoices.\nI had many choices in life until now.\nWhether it was to pursue a simple lifestyle or give up on my humanity to attain power. To love a simple man and marry like a typical woman or pursue a man who walks toward trouble yet looks unbelievably adorable all the time.\nI always chose confidently whatever seemed right to me.\nBut at this moment, I had rather trouble determining upon which choice I should resolve.\nIn front of me was the panting black-haired woman who was bleeding from various places due to the damages, which I inflicted just in self-defense.\nI didn't know what came after I broke her blade, but she seemed to go berserk or sort. However, it didn't mean I would just take a hit from her, even though she was close to someone precious to me.\nNow the problem where my decision wasn't reaching was what I should do about this woman.\nShe undoubtedly was the girl I saw on Austin's device, but the woman I am seeing right now, by all means, was older than the person I saw over the screen.\nWell, the summoning spell is a part of Space and Time magic, so she might be from the future of the universe from which Austin's sister still wasn't healthy.\nAs Grandma said, Space and Time are the two of the most twisted topics which no entity has been able to unravel entirely until now.\nWell, back to the present.\nWhat was revolving inside my mind was two options.\nFirst, I let this woman meet her brother and see my precious Austin smile in elation which he undoubtedly would direct at his long-lost sister.\nSecond, I kill her right here and now to keep my Austin for myself.\nIt goes without saying that this girl wouldn't be just a transient disturbance in our relationship. She is a very important part of my darling's life.\nSince Austin hadn't seen her, most probably, and this woman also hadn't recognized her brother, I was the only bridge who could connect them.\nSo killing her wouldn't leave any damage to our relationship. Austin would never know what happened to his sister when he would be done with the system. And my life with my precious would remain happy and peaceful for the countless upcoming years.\nThis would be the best course of action. My Austin was only for me, after all.\nI can't share him with anyone.\nI can't see him smiling at anyone other than me.\nI can't let his love get divided...\nI want Austin all for myself.\nAustin is mine!\nAUSTIN IS MINE!!\n\"H-Hey you...\"\nSuddenly my chain of thoughts broke down as I heard the voice along with painful groans from the woman.\nTearing something silvery from hanging around her neck, she extended it toward me with her hand still quivering from the barrage of attacks she launched earlier.\n\"C-Can you give this to my Onii-sama, please?\"\nWordlessly I took the thing from her, which was carved in a heart shape and seemingly looked like a pendant.\nClipping the center lock, a picture of a smiling boy appeared, which I very well knew was of whom.\nWith my eyes sparkling, I asked the woman.\n\"And why did you choose this as your last wish?\"\nMaybe, I was trying to find a reason for something I wouldn't accept. It might be the reason I saw Austin's past face that my mood elevated like this as I heard her answering my question.\n\"The reason I am alive right now. The reason I can *cough* move fo-forward each day is in your hands. My O-Onii-sama is everything to me. Since it would not be possible to see him again, I *huff* I want you just to let him know that I still love him...\"\nSaying so, the woman fell unconscious with her face flat on the ground.\nNow, how was I supposed to kill her?\nPortraying such love for the same person I love, in a way, made me happy since there was someone who acknowledged how great of a person my beloved darling is.\nEven at the moment, which could be counted as her last blink before her death, she was trying to reach out to her brother.\nNot to talk about Austin, who even try to hide but still look at his sister over his device in the middle of the nights or sometimes makes a face which evidently tells how badly he was missing someone dear to him.\nNow, how was I supposed to keep these two away?\nI know I would regret it or might hate myself for this, but this is the last thing I could land my resolve upon...\n'I am so gonna regret this...'\n___________________\nIn a place that was covered with natural greenery and sounds from varying creatures reverberating profoundly, could be seen two figures.\nFirst was the woman who had long silver hair currently tied in a bun as she stared at the person cozily sleeping on her thighs.\nThe person whom she was giving her lap as a pillow was a blond youth who had a charming face adorned with very sculptural features.\n\"Mm. This feels nice...\"\nAs Austin mumbled in his sleep while enjoying the comfortable thighs of Luna, the latter giggled in amusement as she saw the childish expression of her lover.\nAustin parted his lids as he heard the beautiful giggle of the person whose voice he could pinpoint, even from a crowd.\n\"Luna! Are you fine?! Thank god, you are safe.\"\nAustin instantly got up and hugged Luna in a tight embrace as the last thing he remembered was the collision with the mana wall before he fell unconsciously because of the effect he felt from the barrier.\nLuna was startled by being showered with so much love, but she would never reject such gestures if it's from the person she adores.\n\"I am fine. Thank you for worrying about me.\"\nLuna patiently waited for Austin to calm down as she patted his back to help him overcome his anxiety.\nAustin kept clinging to Luna until he wasn't satisfied that what was in his arms wasn't a dream but reality. And a very beautiful one at that.\n\"You okay now?\"\nLuna passed him a water bottle after they kept on sharing warmth and assuring each other of their presence for a long ten minutes, before separating.\n\"Thanks. What about Xylex? Did you finish what we intended to?\"\nAustin gulped on the water after asking as, from what he could sense, there wasn't any barrier around the vicinity anymore nor any miasma emitting from the palace side.\nUpon hearing Austin, Luna took a heavy sign like she was resolving something before she asked for something, which made Austin confused.\n\"Well, before that, I want you to meet someone.\"\nAustin parted the bottle from his lips with perplexion evidently spread over his face.\n\"Are they someone special?\"\n\"Well, you can say so. Come on; you will love this.\"\n___________________\nA/N:- Well, Luna's dark side was something you guys must have expected. Anyway, drop a comment.\nAnd sorry for the short chapter. I will compensate in next one.",

      "content": "I love my big brother.\nSince childhood, I have had very few friends, and in name of relatives, I did have cousins, but they barely talked with me straight-faced.\nAnd given my introverted nature since childhood, I also never felt like growing closer to anyone except for one person.\nHe was a high schooler living in the same neighborhood, except for the fact that he lived alone. I was two years younger than him, so after getting acquainted while on my commute, I started calling him Nii-san.\nHe was a nice guy. He liked the band I used to hear, and also, he was a fan of the same idol group I follow. We quickly grew really close.\nMy mom, didn't like my Nii-san, because he was older than me and also he was an orphan, so she thought that my brother would be unruly and mannerless. So disgusting way of perception she had.\nThat's why me and my Nii-sama hanged out at his place. I sometimes gave him food, too, by sneaking out of the house since Nii-sama didn't have much money, and his part-time job paid significantly less.\nReading manga lazily to going to the aquarium. From cooking together to spending weekends. We were having the best time of our life.\nThese small things were more than enough to make me fall for him.\nHis caring nature. His carefree smile. His polite behavior. His adorable gestures started making my heart tingly all the time whenever he was around.\nEven though I called him my big brother, I was already seeing him as a man.\nI also planned my future with him, where I would make him stay home and look after our kids, and I go to a job to keep our lovely family happy.\nI had my plans, and since I was confident in my skills, I knew I would mend my Nii-sama to enjoy life with me without turning toward any strange path.\nBut everything came down to hell when that day...\n**KNOCK**\n\"We are coming in.\"\n_________\nAs the black-haired woman heard the knock, the figure of a silver-haired woman who had captivated her in this cabin emerged from the other side.\n\"Why did you capture instead of ending me?! And if you really don't intend to kill me, then return my pendant right at this instance!!\"\nThe woman growled as she tried to break free from the chain binders which Luna had conjured before leaving her in the small cabin in the forest of Xylex.\nUpon seeing such a futile try to break free, Luna felt sighing, but she suppressed her weariness and spoke in an indifferent tone.\n\"Well, I gave it to someone.\"\nThe raven eyes of the woman went wide in disbelief as her face went to Luna's nape before she found that, indeed, the silver chain wasn't there anymore.\n\"W-Who did you give it to...\"\nHer mouth was wide agape, finding it difficult even to mutter the words that made her mind numb.\nThat pendant was the last thing that her Onii-sama gave her before she lost him and fell into a comma. If she were to lose that last piece of the memorandum, then there wouldn't be anything that could connect her with him.\nBut thankfully, Luna's following words made her calm down a little but soon baffled too.\n\"Don't worry; I gave it to its rightful owner, whom you wanted me to pass it to.\"\nThe woman blinked in quite a perplexion as she tried to find the meaning behind her words, and when she did realize what Luna said...another round of shock passed through her comprehensibility.\n\"You...ca-can't be serious.\"\n\"Then why don't you see by yourself.\"\nSaying so, Luna made space at the entrance before a figure of a teenage boy appeared inside the room.\nThe first thing the captive woman noticed was the platinum blond hair adorning the person's head before her gaze fell upon his emerald orbs which were staring at him with a complicated look.\n\"S-Saya....\"\nThe person whom Austin regarded as Saya, felt her senses betraying her since the silhouette she often saw in her dreams while she was in comma belonged to the man in front.\nAnd not only that. There was not a single person whom she told her name after being summoned into this world. A foreigner knowing her name whom she had a complete doubt to be familiar with...\nHer heart was going terribly anxious, passing each second.\n\"O-Onii-sama...?\"\nShe wasn't even able to utter words properly because of the tears she was wailing up with. Her hazy eyes were soon filled with hot liquid, just like the person she called her big brother.\nNeither of them noticed when Saya's bind disappeared or when the third person left the room.\nExiting the cabin, Luna sighed heavily as she tried her best not to go inside for the time being.\nShe knew if she was to see Austin near another woman, even if the woman was his sister, she might lose it with her current state of mind.\n\"Let's see where those two are.\"\nActivating levitation, she flew away while tracking the mana signature of the hero and Sicily, who left the palace quite sometime early.\nIt didn't take her time to pinpoint Sicily's location, which was just on the other side of the bridge which connected the outer city with the palace.\nDescending, she saw Kyouki getting treated by Sicily as she band-aid his shoulder, and helped him relieve his pain.\nLuna sighed once again, and used her healing on the ragged hero before the two realized someone was approaching them.\n\"Luna-urgh!!\"\nKyouki, who, after seeing Luna all of a sudden, energetically tried to get up only to feel the internal damage all over again.\n\"Stay still, since I won't be using my mana on you again.\"\nLuna stated coldly, which made Kyouki speechless.\nSicily was facepalming at Kyouki's behavior, who couldn't seem to remain calm just upon catching a glimpse of Luna.\n\"So, what were those terrifying blasts some time ago? And what about Xylex and the demons?\"\nSicily slightly shivered as the memory of Luna fighting the masses emerged in her mind, as well as the massive explosion she heard while running away with Kyouki.\n\"Well, everything was sorted out. Now Xylex won't take the initiative or, more like, can't. Anyway, should we grab something to eat?\"\nLuna proposed as she started walking forward, before the two also stood up steadily to follow her.\nBoth Kyouki and Sicily had a perplexed expressions on their faces as they blinked toward each other for a moment before Sicily asked the obvious.\n\"Umm, Luna? Where is Austin?\"\nLuna, without changing her expression nor her movements, spoke in a serene tone.\n\"He...he has went somewhere, but would surely return. Let's go.\"\n______________________\nA/N:- Next chapter would contain Austin's and Saya's conversation majorly.",

      "content": "\"S-Saya....?\"\n\"O-Onii-sama...\"\nBoth pairs of eyes were staring at the person in front like this wasn't real but just a wishful imagination.\nFor Austin, there were countless things to contemplate upon.\nLike, as how she could suddenly appear when Austin watched her over the phone, which the system provided. The Saya, which Austin watches over with surveillance, still belonged to his previous world; how did she come here?\nAnd how was she looking so mature when in his memory, Saya was only a naive little child, which Austin loved to spoil?\nBut in actuality, Austin wasn't thinking any of the things he should be at this moment, since the person in front was making his comprehensibility go numb and senses blank to oblivion.\nThe woman walked baby steps just like the man but all of a sudden, Saya halted in her actions and raised her voice.\n\"No... It can't be. It's not real... You are not real. You can't be my Onii-sama..!!\"\nTears were flowing down her cheeks as she cried her grief like she was pushed into a fantasy where her heart was shouting her to embrace the man and wail out all her sorrow, but her mind was warning her not to believe whatever her eyes spoke.\nHer legs were shaking, with her heart going colder and colder passing each second as she closed her eyes and let the tears fall continuously.\nAll of a sudden, a certain warmth enveloped her frame, without her even noticing someone approaching.\nShooting her eyes abruptly, she saw the man who was feet apart was now embracing her.\n\"Shh..... It's okay. Nii-san is here.\"\n\"Let me go... You are not him! You are not him! Let me go!\"\nSaya was flailing her limbs while trying to push away Austin but taking her natural strength into account; she evidently wasn't trying to push him away.\nAustin kept on embracing his little sister like a precious glass doll that would break if he was to apply a little force.\n\"You are..not... You are.. *sniff* Waaaaaaahhh!!\"\nLastly, Saya surrendered.\nShe might not believe her eyes or heart, but this warmth. This warmth, she can only feel from a single person.\nLetting go of all restraints, and bringing out all the accumulated suffering and longingness, Saya hugged her beloved Onii-sama, like a small kid clinging to their parents after being bullied.\n[Ding!]\n[Weekly requirements fulfilled...]\nThe system popped in front of Austin's retina, but in his current state of mind, he didn't bother with the message.\nThere were tears in Austin's eyes too, but seeing his sister's miserable condition he held back himself and helped her calm down first.\nHe didn't know how such things took place, and he was reunited with his long-lost sister, but there was no way he would complain since this unexpectedness was more than welcome.\nIn the cold wooden cabin in the middle of a dense forest, sat two figures while embracing each other like there was nothing left for them in the world and what they required was only each other's presence.\nSaya cried for a long time, and Austin started to get worried. He helped her wipe her tears, and gave her water, so she doesn't dehydrate, but only after half an hour, she seemed to calm down a little.\nIt was a sight to behold, where a mature woman with an incredible figure was weeping like a kid while clinging to a boy much younger than her.\n\"You okay now?\"\nAustin asked as he arranged Saya's midnight-long hair and tied them neatly in a ponytail, just like he did back in the past.\n\"I hate you, Onii-sama. You left me all alone back there. Have you thought about what would have happened if I didn't get summoned here?\"\nWith a slight smile, Austin replied.\n\"So is Saya going to leave her Onii-sama again, since she hates him?\"\nSaya instantly shook her head as she lifted her face to look at her Onii-sama, only to see his amused smile spread across.\n\"Mou~ Ani no baka!\"\n(A/N: - Brother's stupid)\nSaya pouted before turning her head away from Austin.\nAustin wasn't able to control it as he burst into a small laugh while patting the bullied Saya.\nHearing her brother's hearty laugh, Saya also smiled as if she wasn't angry in the first place.\nEven though his face was different, his hairs were now dyed, or his eyes were painted in a different shade, she could still see her old Onii-sama in Austin.\nHis gentle care, melodious laugh, and tender touch were similar to what she was used to and desired to experience all her life.\n\"Okay now. Are you hungry? Should we get something to eat?\"\nAustin asked as he stood up while supporting Saya.\nOnce again, when she stood almost half feet taller than him, Austin noticed how much she had grown up in so little time.\n\"Hey, Saya... What age did you turn in this year?\"\nAustin asked, still unsure how Saya turned like this when he saw her teenage image on screen just half a day ago.\nAnother pout made its way on Saya's cheek as she complained.\n\"Onii-sama. Asking a lady about her age is no good!! \"\n\"Ah, yeah. Sorry.\"\nAustin apologized right away for his insensitivity; however, soon Saya smiled as she quelled her brother's query.\n\"It's okay, Onii-sama. And I am turning 24 this year.\"\nAustin nodded as he thought of something for a long half minute before extending his previous idea.\n\"So, should we go out?\"\nExtending his hand, Austin asked. Saya blushed heavily before grabbing her brother's hand immediately as she nodded.\n\"Mm-mm.\"\nBoth of them left the cabin hand in hand, as the greenery entered their vision just upon stepping out.\nFrom the sun's position, it seemed that it was about 2 in the noon as they started strolling through the forest while chatting about various things.\n\"So Saya. How did you get here? I mean, haven't you fallen into a coma because of your Terminal Illness?\".\nFrom what Austin remembers, the system alerted him about the completion of his weekly requirement, which meant that the Saya over his phone must have reached a state where she could recover all by herself.\nNow, whether the system was conning him all along, or this might be some kind of time travel. And Saya's following words made Austin conclude with his second option.\n\"I did fall into a coma just after the day you... You left me. But in my subconscious mind, I always felt you were watching over me but with a different appearance. And soon, not so long after I got up from my coma, my illness disappeared like it wasn't there in the first place. You should have seen the doctor's reaction.\"\nNow, he was certain that he Saya he used to watch over the screen was the same Saya he was witnessing right in front, but just the time has leaped.\n'Time and space magic... It always makes me dizzy. '\n\"And what about your summoning? Did it happen just anonymously, or you were together with the other summoned?\"\nLike what he read in the manga, people generally get summoned altogether, but Saya's next words made him baffled.\n\"No, I don't actually know the others and where they came from. I was just told that if I want to meet my beloved then I have to step in the illuminated circle in front, and so I did. And now, I am glad I took this step.\"\nIntervening her fingers, Saya confessed with a blush heating her face as it was really a dream-like scenario for her to be able to be with her Onii-sama, again.\nAustin smiled at Saya, but his mind was rumbling around the last words she spoke.\nThe Xylex Kingdom was the one who summoned heroes and from what the interrogation stated, it seemed they used their divine beast's mana to activate the ritual.\nBut neither the beast nor the Xylex kingdom should be aware about Austin's past self or his relationship with Saya.\nThere were so many things to solve but anytime Austin thinks that he has unraveled a knot, a whole dozen new mysterious erupts from nowhere.\n'There is someone or something working in the background, which I have to know about, as soon as possible...

      "content": "On a clear day of spring, could be seen two figures currently flying through the sky while sharing a very intimate space.\nSince Saya didn't know how to levitate, or as she pretended to, Austin was left with no choice but to carry her in the bridal hold, all the way toward the lower town so they can eat something.\nSaya was hugging her Onii-sama dearly as she enjoyed the gentle breeze along with the warmth she could get never enough of.\nHer eyes were closed in bliss, as she spoke in a melodious tone.\n\"Where are we going, Onii-sama~.\"\nSaya had created a barrier around them which not only provided physical and magical protection but also gave them stealth along with enough silence so they could converse comfortably.\nEven if she asked about the place they were moving to, Saya couldn't care less about it since she would be fine until her Onii-sama was with her.\nAustin, who had a slight smile on his face, was completely unaffected by the space he was sharing with Saya, which made the latter a little disheartened, too, as he spoke in a serene tone.\n\"A particular hotel in downtown. Since you didn't usually leave the castle, you might like this place.\"\nFrom what Austin heard from her, Saya generally stayed at the palace since she was bound with a curse that didn't let her disobey the orders of the divine beast.\nOf course, it was removed by a particular saint; that's why Saya was fine even though she was leaving the main castle without permission.\nSaya, after responding in a rhythmic hum, heard her brother continuing what he had left to say previously.\n\"...and I want you to meet someone special to me.\"\nThis time Saya didn't respond as her smile broke down instantly too.\nSaya muttered under her breath as she saw her brother's gentle expression, which became even more charming just as he mentioned about someone Saya really does want to meet again.\n'Now finally, you have pricked my interest, Saint~.'\n______________________\nWhile descending into a secluded alley, Austin asked his sister about something concerning.\n\"You sure no one would recognize you, right?\"\n\"I told you, Onii-sama, I never left the palace usually, so no one knows that this face belongs to the hero.\"\nSaya, even being dissatisfied, got out of Austin's arms as she assured him about her identity in the town.\nSince there wasn't any issue with the capital spies now, Austin didn't use the herb and got out of the alley while still in his original aesthetic.\nIt was bound to attract attention when a charming foreigner boy walked on the street with an amazingly curvaceous and beautiful woman beside him.\nDue to their height difference, one might misunderstand them as brother and sister, but Saya's timid demeanor so she could hold Austin's hand, made various doubts about this relationship.\nBut in the end, no one interrupted the duo before they made their way to their destination.\n'Ramen and Miso Corner.'\nThe name of the shop made Saya's eyes sparkle as she followed Austin inside the restaurant.\n\"Welc-huh?\"\nIn the middle of the musical welcome, the shop's owner halted suddenly, as her eyes fell on the customers just entered inside.\n\"Hero-sama?\"\nAkiko, the shop owner's eyes went wide in disbelief as she immediately shot out of the kitchen counter under the shocking gaze of others, before she bowed deeply in front of the duo, or to be precise, in front of Saya.\n\"I welcome you to my unruly abode. I might not be able to provide the best hospitality, but disappointment would be the last thing you will experience once leaving this place.\"\nShe nearly shouted her welcoming speech, which naturally the others, too, heard.\n\"Did the madame say, 'Hero'?\"\n\"This can't be...that infamous hero...?\"\n\"Her babies are big... I wanna feel them~*hic*. \"\n\"This can't be possible for that* hero to come here, right? \"\nWhispers and chattering started to revolve at a furious pace with the tall raven-haired young woman, in the center of it.\n\"L-let's go in first. Akiko-san, please excuse the misbehave.\"\nLeaving the still bowed Akiko behind, Austin pulled Saya's hand and walked in a rush.\nSaya blushed slightly upon seeing how her brother protected her from the world despite being already able to destroy everyone present inside that hall.\nSoon Austin led his sister inside the eatery, which was a little less to almost non-populated, with illumination on a dim level since special guests are only allowed to this section.\nNaturally, the person whom the owner regarded as a hero wouldn't be interrupted by other maids; heck, they didn't even dare to come to light in fear of angering Saya.\nAustin's eyes went toward the table where solely a woman sat while gulping on something like she had been thirsty since a very long.\nHis heart became calmer after catching her glimpse, but before he could walk forward, an olive-haired girl appeared right before him.\n\"Where were you, Austin?\"\n\"Sicily. What happened?\"\nSaya narrowed her gaze at the mage warrior who was speaking to her brother quite intimately, which she naturally didn't like much.\n'It seems there are more than one to handle... '\n\"I don't know where you went and who this woman is...but Luna seems in a terrible temper. She has been chugging down since forever even though she couldn't get drunk. Her unspoken agitation was so high, that even Kyou-kun had taken a strategic retreat. Whatever you do, please don't make her even angrier or we might not return home today.\"\nAs Sicily continued, in between Austin ran his eyes and indeed saw a small black-haired figure of a boy waving meekly at him.\n**Gulp**\nA strong gulp made away down his throat as he again looked at Luna and found that, indeed, her eyes belonged to the Saint, which he was used to glared with, before the ball night.\nBut he wouldn't back out now. In the first place, there wasn't any reason to be nervous since he and Saya had no such relationship nor any plan for having anything in the future.\nBut just to be on the safe side, he asked something from the girl in front.\n\"Sicily, can you create your best barrier around this hall, and also can you ask Akiko-san to evacuate the place.\"\nThis time Sicily gulped hard as her eyes went to Saya for a second, before she nodded in agreement.\n\"Best of luck, Austin. I hope you a great future.\"\n\"Thanks Sicily.\"\n________________________\nA/N: - Sicily and Austin can be good friends no? Anyway, drop a comment.\nAnd yeah, since the next chapter would be long, I pardon for this one ?",

      "content": "(A/N: - Before you guys start the chapter, I want to clarify one important point. The fact Saya was behaving so oblivion about the world and didn't react to Luna's appearance is simple. She didn't read the manga. Now enjoy the chapter~)\n-----------------------------------\nIn a tranquil hall which by, furniture and atmosphere looked like a cozy restaurant. However, the atmosphere around a particular table made breathing extremely dangerous.\nOn a separate table, sat Kyouki while sipping on his drink while glancing at the table in front, and some time toward his party member who was standing near the entrance.\nThe party member mentioned was the olive-haired mage warrior, Sicily. She had a very nervous look, tainting her slightly mature yet charming face as she stood beside the shop owner.\nAkiko also had the same expression as Sicily since the time she heard about the outer covering of the matter.\nFor Akiko, Saya was a tremendously terrifying being who could blow mountains with one hit, and from what the girl beside her told, it seemed the silver-haired saint was no bad either.\n'I just hope my shop survives at the end of the day. '\n...\nBack on the round table at the corner of the hall sat three figures with varying expressions on their faces.\nSaya and Luna, were sitting just opposite while facing each other, with Austin to their side in between, while glancing at the two with a dry smile.\n(A/N: - Like C)\nIt's already been more than a minute since they sat, but neither Luna nor Saya have broken eye contact with each other and staring like they were evaluating each other's worth.\nAustin concluded that he had to take the initiative as who knows how long this staring competition would go on.\n\"*Ahem* Luna.\"\nUpon hearing her beloved's voice, Luna broke her contact as her gaze turned to a complete abort, and with a softness blended in her eyes, she looked at him.\n\"Yes, darling~.\"\n**CRACK**\nThe glass which Saya was holding cracked before it broke into small pieces; as she apologized right away.\n\"Oops! I just got a little careless. Anyway, carry on, Onii-sama.\"\nLooking at her chilly smile, Akiko standing far away, broke into cold sweat since it was the first time she saw the hero smiling, yet it didn't give a single good premonition.\n\"Hey, did it hurt? Lemme see.\"\nAustin moved with an antiseptic and cotton appearing in his hand as he checked Saya's palm.\n**CREAK**\nAnother cracking sound came from his left before he heard another glass breaking sound which naturally came from Luna before he saw the beer mug in her hand disappear into pieces.\n\"Oops! I also hurt myself. Care to heal me too, darling?\"\nAustin felt sighing since now he realized what was going on.\nHe sat back without treating either of them as he spoke in a stern tone.\n\"Can I have a decent chat with the two of you, without these small banters, please?\"\n**SWISH**\nUpon hearing their beloved's plea, both of them used a similar kind of spell and cleaned the place along with themselves before nodding simultaneously.\n\"Okay now. Luna. She is the sister I always talked about and the person who helped me survive my last life. I know I have already told you, but she is the only person I have ever known as a family. So please try to get along with her.\"\nThe expression on Saya's face was nothing less than ecstatic, as with a blush, she looked at her Onii-sama in a way that Luna by no means liked.\nBut she endured.\nShe couldn't act rashly here.\n** Inhale **\n** Exhale **\n\"And, Saya. This gorgeous lady is my lover, Luna Eldritch. Despite having so many options and routes she could walk upon, she chose me at that time when I was nothing more than trash. If someone understands your brother in this world, she would be the only one. I want you to respect and listen to her, just like you do to me.\"\nA smug was adorning the not-so-mature Saint's lips as she directed her amused gaze upon the raven-haired woman in front.\n\"You call Austin your big brother, no? Then you might call me sister-in-law or maybe onee-san for convenience?\"\nA thin vein popped on top of Saya's forehead as she heard the taunt, which made her regret why the battle in Xylex's arena didn't go in the way she desired.\nThe unspoken cold war continued when suddenly a peculiar warmth covered the hands of either woman before they heard Austin speaking again.\n\"I know the way you guys hadn't a great start, and it's kinda tough to accept each other so abruptly, but I want you both to know that without you guys, I won't have been here where I am right now.\"\nMaybe it was meeting Saya after so long or the insecurity he felt from Luna; Austin was speaking those honest thoughts he didn't intend to bring up.\n\"Onii-sama...\"\n\"Austin...\"\nBoth of them looked at his smile, which spoke more than words, as they whispered while altogether dropping the previous expressions they had.\nLuna realized how she was avoiding Austin's feelings since he came inside with his sister, which made her utterly guilty.\nThat same goes for Saya, but she was more concerned about something she might ask him afterward.\n\"Okay then. From the looks, it seems Akiko-san won't be coming near our table, so I will go real quick and order something for us.\"\nJust as he stood up, Austin kissed Luna's cheek, which the latter accepted wholeheartedly.\nAs Austin went toward the two ladies who had been looking at the scene with curious eyes until now, the table again went dead silent.\nLuna's lips were curved in a full blooming smile as she fidgeted left to right in elation.\n\"Don't think Onii-sama called you his lover; I will allow you to be with him. If you don't know, then let me tell you this. I love my Onii-sama more than as a brother.\"\nLuna's smile didn't break out as she replied with a nonchalant expression.\n\"Look into my eyes, Imouto-chan. Do you think I take you even as a rival? For me, you are nothing more than another pest I can trample upon and continue my life with, my darling, just like before.\"\nThere was apparent arrogance blended with provocation, in her words, as Luna stated in the utmost confidence. And her statement wasn't only barks, since she already had shown the might she carries and the love she holds for Austin.\nBut instead of getting agitated, a smirk came up on Saya's seductive lips as she muttered in a similar tone.\n\"You lost the chance, Saint. Now, if you get rid of me, do you think my Onii-sama would love you the same way he does now?\"\nLuna's smile broke down in an instant as what she heard from the minx in front was true. If Luna wanted to end Saya, then she already got the opportunity, but now when Austin has reunited with his sister, there was no chance for her to break this bond.\nIt would be disastrous if Austin came to hate her!\nNo, she might end herself if that happens.\nWith a sharp gaze, Luna asked in a crisp tone after imagining what she had never thought about previously.\n\"What do you want?\"\n\"Isn't it obvious?\"\nWith the smirk still spread across her face, Saya leaned back as she crossed her arms under her bountiful assets before she spoke.\n\"You won't come in my path, and the same goes for me. Until the end of one year from now, if I won't be able to make Onii-sama see me as a woman, and make him fall for me, then I will lead the role of a good sister until the very end of my life. But in this one year, you can't take him away, or I might not give up on him, ever.\"\nLuna registered the word not long after it was spoken as she fell into deep contemplation.\nBut Saya wasn't generous enough to give Luna time to think.\n\"Ara~ Is it fear am I sensing from the almighty Saint? I wonder if my dear sister-in-law doubts whether her love is enough to keep my Onii-sama bounded~.\"\nLuna's eyes went cold in annoyance as she threw all her worries and extended her hand as she spoke.\n\"Just one year, and after that, I will make you my bride's maid.\"\n\"Well, we will see about that~.\"\n_____________________\nA/N: - Two beautiful sadists are fighting, eh?

      "content": "In the same hall where some significant decisions and agreements were concluded previously, sat the three while feasting on a similar kind of food.\nSince, Austin knew Saya's choice in ramen, he asked for one and ordered a different flavor for him and Luna as well, since he took the liberty to be confident in his taste.\nAkiko, prepared all the dishes by herself and also cooked something for herself, Sicily and Kyouki too.\nCurrently, these three were sitting just some table apart from Austin's group since they didn't want to be in the immediate danger zone yet couldn't leave the juicy conversation either.\n\"It's delicious, right?\"\n\"It surely is. It's been so long since I have eaten garlic ham ramen~.\"\nSaya said in a satisfied tone since, as just like her brother, she was a bonafide addict to ramen, and since she didn't mingle with anyone after summoning here, Saya regrets what she missed.\n\"You should say thanks to Akiko-san. She also is from Japan but from a different timeline.\"\nWhile Austin waited for the food in the kitchen, he had a small conversation with Akiko which led him to know that Akiko belonged to the '90s, which was why she was utterly oblivion about isekai and stuff.\nUpon hearing her Onii-sama, Saya turned her head toward the black-haired woman who also was looking at their side.\nJust founding Saya's eyes, Akiko choked on the rice she was eating, as Sicily patted the pitiful owner for being so nervous.\n\"Well, I might hold the gratitude for now.\"\nSaya spoke with a wry smile, as she continued eating her appetizing ramen.\n\"Ah, wait.\"\nSince Luna was having quite a trouble handling the chopstick, she was clumsily making her lips and sometimes cheeks covered in ramen soup.\nAustin helped her wipe up, since the saint was already having a hard time keeping up with the other two.\n\"Anyway, Saya. Have you thought, about what you will do from now?\"\nAustin would undoubtedly be in touch with Saya if she chose to stay in Xylex, but he knew that decision would be improbable, and Saya's following words clarified his doubts.\n\"Of course, I will follow Onii-sama, wherever he goes. Anywhere is fine until I could be with Onii-sama.\"\nAustin fell into contemplation as to what ways he could let Saya stay in school. Given her age, she couldn't become a student of Eden Academy, and other than teachers, staff, and students, no one was allowed inside.\nSensing his obvious worries, Luna brought her hand over Austin's as she spoke after finishing her meal.\n\"Don't worry, Darling. I will handle it.\"\nA smile made way on Austin's lips as he nodded contentedly.\n\"That reminds me, Imouto-chan..\"\n\"Don't call me that!\"\n\"..weren't you appraised Demi-God rank? How come while fighting you, I didn't feel you being above than a Legendary Rank? Or is it just you putting up airs before?\"\nSaya's eyes turned cold, but only if her brother didn't have spoken, she would have a gave a really great answer to this sharp tongues saint.\n\"Yeah, Saya. I am also curious about this Demi-God rank since this is the first time I heard that something between Hero and God exists.\"\nEvery rank has three grades. Above Unique rank, every grade of every Rank gets its specific name like; the third grade of Legendary Rank is called Saint class, in which Headmaster Merlin and Luna belonged.\nLuna was certainly under-evaluated since she didn't want to gather attention. But to have another Legend Rank on campus would surely bring a lot of curious gazes toward her.\n\"Well, Onii-sama, truth to be told, I do feel I have a lot of potential, which I can discover as long I don't stop. My mana reserve is undoubtedly more than I store inside. But it's been only months since I came here, I didn't get that much time to witness my own limits.\"\nIt was miraculous in itself that Saya was able to become this strong in so less time since it takes a lot to get used to in this newfound atmosphere, and also, as easy mana usage sounds, it's definitely not is.\nA new sensation. A new kind of energy. The summoning ritual might have provided support, but still, the level Saya has reached was still outstanding for someone to attain in so less duration.\nIf compared to raw strength, Austin would definitely lose to Saya, but Austin's fortè is in mana manipulation, in which he could easily leave Saya miles behind.\n\"Hmm, so you need just to enhance your skills and develop your foundation, huh? I think your physical might and weapon handling are going well, from what I have heard. As in for mana, then there is no one better than her.\"\nAustin gestured toward Luna, who had a faint smile on her face, as she followed just behind Austin.\n\"Do give yourself a little honor Austin. You are also a brilliant mage who has come so far all on your own. I did have my grandma but you... You are a self-made warrior.\"\n\"Yes, Onii-sama. From what I heard, you single-handedly pulverized the whole army of demons, and also, you were able to chant such a high-level spell, which I.. Anyway, I know you are amazing, so do give yourself some credit.\"\nAustin, upon being praised so openly, scratched the back of his head as he blushed slightly.\n\"Is that so? Thank you both.\"\nA blush made way on the ladies' faces too, but it wasn't because they were shy or embarrassed, instead...\n**GULP**X2\n(A/N: - You know if you know ;)\n_____________________\nAfter finishing another round of ramen since a superhuman diet exceeds way beyond a normal appetite, everyone gathered in the main hall as they sipped on the tea which Akiko brewed for them.\n\"Can I have some tea leaves of these? I really like the taste.\"\n\"Certainly, Saint-sama.\"\nAkiko nodded as she brought a kilogram packet of tea which she herself grows and sells in the market.\nAs Luna took the pack, Austin took out a pouch filled with gold coins, and he passed it to the owner.\n\"Here, Akiko-san. I think it will cover our food costs and also the inconvenience we provided to your guests.\"\nAkiko shook her head and was about to decline such a heavy amount when a hand came on top of her shoulder.\n\"Take it, Akiko-san. You deserve it.\"\nAkiko's blood went cold as she recognized whose voice it was as the hand which was pushing Austin's pouch suddenly pulled it.\n\"I-It's as you say, Hero-sama.\"\nSaya smiled wryly as it seemed she had made Akiko terrified in the past, which led this temperament of hers toward Saya.\n\"Okay then, guys, it's time to go back. Remember what we have to say, and especially Kyouki, don't stir misunderstanding by following an honest path or sort.\"\nKyouki sneered yet nodded since what Austin had asked them to tell would be better for everyone.\n\"Very well, Akiko-san. Thanks for the hospitality; I hope to see you again.\"\nAs he concluded his thanks, Luna also got done with the teleportation spell.\nSoon the scenery for the five changed significantly before the destination, which was, of course, set at Eden Academy, appeared not so long after.\nBut when everyone saw the sight in front, their eyes went wide except for Saya.\n\"Why do I feel I have visited this place recently...\"\n______________________\nA/N: - There will be leisure chapters and fluffy chapters for some time along with intro of new characters and the arrival of new events.\nLet's jump to the next arc~",

      "content": "[A day ahead of present time]\n\"Alex Nuèye. Not only have you kept the fact of demons cooperating with the Southern Continent, but you also let Hero Kyouki-kun leave the academy. And if it was not enough, the summoned hero who appeared out of nowhere, you told her about our nation's pride, Saintess-sama's location, too. Can you give an appropriate reason for your actions?\"\nIn an extravagantly decorated courtroom of Gram palace could be seen several figures with the bespectacled mage in the center of every gaze at the moment.\nThere weren't all the courtiers present currently, but only the high-rank nobles, along with the second prince Mikhail and, of course, the Emperor himself.\nThe chain of events that had been happening for more than a week now had made everything riled up. The war on the border finally ended with solely Charles left on the battlefield.\nGram lost thousands of elite soldiers along with a tremendous amount of resources. Still, fortunately, the entity with the surname Charles was way beyond any of the demons' capability to subdue.\nThe news about Eden academy was a great shock to the kingdom since they didn't have much preparation to counter such a high degree of war.\nBut the appearance of a single human, whom no one scaled more than a mere Newbie ranked previously, made a massive difference from what could have happened if not for the presence of this single blond youth.\nMikhail's chest was pumped with pride since his statement about Austin being an asset for Gram had been proven with this all-out war.\nBut the problem arises from the involvement of Xylex, which made this whole issue a diplomatic matter.\nWilliam's cold gaze was fixated on the court magician as he patiently waited for the accused to speak.\n\"With due honor, my lord, whatever I attained, I take full responsibility for it. The reason I didn't choose to inform the Council about Xylex's involvement in the matter was simple.\"\nWithout any change of expression, William, this time, spoke instead of the prime minister who spoke the accusations before.\n\"And that is.\"\n\"Trust, my lord. I don't believe everyone I share space within this capital. I feared that if any of the spies from the foreign kingdom was to know about the situation, then they might doubt our foreign relations. If I had, I would have kept this whole attack on Eden academy under the sheets since it might show Gram's vulnerability.\"\nGasps resonated in the court as the words concluded from Alex's lips. It wasn't just about his doubts about Gram's integrity but also the possible threat that might be advancing while they held this meeting ongoing here.\n\"I apologize for being rude here, your Majesty, but I would like to ask whether Court Magician Alex-sama doesn't trust on upper echelon or does he has lost faith in Gram entirely?\"\nThe one who asked was a Count of territory near Gram, just like Vincent Wright. His query was justifiable, but it didn't make the audience any less shocked since the matter was leading to an internal conflict.\n\"Oh please, Count Snyset. Don't mend my words and make me a rebellion. What I mean is that I can't differentiate who is trustable or who is a bastard imposter in the council. In the case during the Northern conflict and also a student from Eden Academy betrayed his own comrades just for the sake of his love. I have not only two but many other past incidents which prove that not everyone in the capital is worthy of leaving our backs to.\"\nDeep silence befell as Alex concluded his honest belief. What he said was, in a way, tangible to the current situation, but it didn't help that even one of the strongest nations wasn't safe from its own people's hands.\nSuddenly the olive-haired duke stood up as he, after taking the permission to speak, raised another concerning query toward Alex.\n\"But still, your statement doesn't justify why you chose to speak Saint-sama's location to Xylex's hero when you were aware of the fact that Light hero-sama was together with her.\"\nGazes again fell on the purple-robed mage as they anticipated a good reason for such rash action, which could have led to Kyouki's death.\nBut even under so much intent, there was a smirk on Alex's lips as he confessed truthfully.\n\"Sooner or later, the hero from Xylex and Kyouki-kun would have faced off, and if Kyouki-kun doesn't have the might to protect himself, then is it really worthy of him being called the Hero of Gram?\"\n\"Be within your limits, Court Magician!!\"\n\"Don't slander the name of Hero-sama!!\"\n\"He is only in his teenage. What do you expect from him!\"\n\"Alex, you are speaking more than your authority!!!\"\nVarious nobles stood up and confronted the Court Mage, but he had no interest in bothering with them.\nAlex's eyes wandered toward the second prince, who was looking back at him with a subjective smirk.\nThe expression on Reynold's face was slightly ugly too, as in his mind, he already had accepted Kyouki as his son-in-law. But unlike those enraged Courtiers, he chose to think first since it's not about his daughter or his son-in-law's pride. What he cares about the most is Gram's prosperity.\n\"With your permission, my lord, I would like to ask Alex-san about what future prospectus he has thought regarding this matter. As for what I expect from the wise Grand Master Alex, he must have prepared everything already as soon he had observed the severeness of this situation.\"\nReynold spoke with a bow, on which William agreed without delay. The agitated Nobles also quieted as they received glares from the Prime Minister, standing beside the Emperor.\n\"I respect the trust Duke Reynold have in me. Well, it's just as he said, I indeed have thought of an idea. A new system which would not only help us find great assets which could prove as a strong Line of Defense for Gram but also help the public once again believe that our nation was, is and will stay strong even in the absence of the Light Hero.\"\nEvery attention was fixated upon Alex as they waited for his following words. The silence was so profound currently that even a pin drop would have sounded like a hammer.\nFinally, after some moments, which felt like an eternity for others, Alex concluded his words.\n\"The tournament of Heroes.\"\n___________________\n[Present Time]\n\"What did you do to our school?!\"\nSicily, as well as others, had similar reactions as they saw the disastrous state of Eden Academy.\nEven though the war took place, the situation wasn't this hazardous. But right now, the Academy looked like ancient ruins except for the fact that people still could be seen moving in and out.\n\"Onii-sama...\"\nSaya tugged Austin's sleeves since she felt guilty for her actions.\nAustin knew she was just following orders, so he didn't say anything, and squeezing her hand, he reassured her.\n\"It's okay. I will do something about it.\"\nAustin was thinking about using his earth Golems to rebuild the castle and also supply portions and artifacts to assist the laborers, but Luna halted his train of thought.\n\"I have got this, Austin. Just stand here and enjoy the show~.\"\nAs Luna said with a smile, she began to levitate.\n\"Ah...\"\nIt seemed Austin wanted to say something, but Luna already took off to a decent height as her figure grew distant.\nHalting at approximately 100 meters from ground level, Luna raised her hands and initiated her spell.\n\"[Infrugent]\"\nSuddenly a vast magic circle which was illuminating with a silvery glow, covered the whole vicinity before the magic circle started ascending at a snail's pace from the surface.\nIt was undoubtedly a Time oriented magic, which was the reconstructing the school in real-time under the shocked gaze of everyone around the area.\nMerlin, who was sitting in his office previously had his eyes wide in utter bafflement, but as soon his gaze fell on the person who was chanting such deity level spell, he returned to his work.\n'It's fortunate she is on our side... '\n\"It's so beautiful.\"\nSicily uttered under her breath as her eyes sparkled with the glow that the mana circle was releasing out.\nIt only took less than five minutes, and the whole castle was once again rebuilt like how it was before the war commenced.\nCheers echoed from the inside of the school as well as from those who were working diligently around the perimeter.\nBut Austin's gaze was only fixed on the woman who was partaking in such a miracle before suddenly she started to fall from her spot just after she concluded the spell.\n\"She is spent.\"\nAustin snatched his hand away from Saya, which made the latter utterly stunned, before he flew at a high pace and caught Luna just when she was about to reach the danger zone.\n\"Hey, you okay?\"\nAustin saw an ecstatic smile on Luna's face with a fresh blush covering her pretty face. From what seemed, Austin doubted whether Luna again was...\n\"Daaling~\"\n....Mana drunk.\n____________________\nA/N: - A tipsy Luna in the next ep, or should I skip it? Comment to let me",

      "content": "Mana Drunk.\nA commonly known sickness in which a person overuses their mana which the person generally doesn't utilize. Like when you have a tank of water, yet you always drink with a glass, and suddenly what if you were to drink with buckets?\nUntil not very severe, there would be mainly side effects of a hazy mind, polluted thought process, and slow understanding of things. Some sudden emotions start to overflow more profoundly, which the sufferer generally suppresses.\nJust like the one we could see right at the moment.\n\"Daaling~Am I beautiful?\"\nAs Luna flailed her arms in Austin's embrace, the blond youth smiled sweetly toward his beloved as he walked inside his dorm room while still carrying Luna in the bridal hold.\n\"Yes, you are the most beautiful woman I have ever met.\"\nHehe, ~ Liar. But since I loved the way darling lied, I will give you a reward~.\"\n**Chu**\nThe third kiss of the evening got marked on Austin's cheek as he slowly put Luna on the bed.\nThe ecstatic Luna fell on the bed with a blooming smile never leaving her face as she felt her darling feeding her something.\n\"Have some water first, Luna. \"\nHe had a small container which he was extending toward the Saintess only to receive pouts in the end.\n\"Don't wanna~ Only if Darling feeds me. \"\n\"But I am feeding you, right? \"\nAustin tilted his head in perplexion as Luna's pout bulged even more as she cleared the difference of understanding.\n\"Not like that, stupid. Mouth-to-mouth~.\"\nAustin blushed slightly as these kinds of things were still new for him. It was the same for Luna, and she would have reacted the same as Austin if only for her drunken mind clouding her reality.\nFinding no other option to get Luna to drink the water, Austin accepted his defeat before pouring down the content into his mouth.\nAs he leaned toward Luna, she giggled playfully.\n\"Ehehe~Austin no Ecchi! \"\nAustin's brows twitched for quite some moments as he saw the saintess having the best fun of her life.\n'This minx.'\nAustin grabbed her chin, and, forcibly parting her lips poured down the water, without minding the surprised gaze the oceanic orbs were directing at him.\nHe used his tongue as an anchor to let the liquid pass through her throat comfortably as he stared at her in the process.\nParting his lips from her, both of them panted slightly as this wild feeding procedure wasn't in either of their expectations. Austin just moved due to being provoked.\n\"Kyaah! I can't get married now! Austin tainted my purity. Now you better take responsibility for your actions, young master. \"\nAustin felt like saying that they had already partaken in various things more than kissing. Saying it took her purity would be nothing less than a laughable accusation.\nBut he didn't laugh but sat beside her before he started unbuttoning her shirt.\n\"Is daaling going to do this and that with Luna? \"\nThe innocent face Luna put to ask while hiding the seductive smirk behind the covers tempted Austin to do something which would immediately pull her from the drunken state and throw her to oblivion, but he had something primarily to take care of.\nUndoing the upper three buttons, Austin uncovered Luna up to her upper chest.\nHer pale skin, along with cleavage peeking out from her hand-stitched bra, made Austin distracted for quite a long.\nHer flushed face, along with the heavy breath she was exchanging, made her bountiful chest heave up and down in an unsteady rhythm. Not to talk about the air blowing out her supple lips, which seemed like hot steams puffing out.\n\"You look incredibly erotic, Luna. \"\nAs Austin sighed to calm his raging heart, he took out an antiseptic, a knife, and cotton from his inventory.\n\"Is that so, darling? Well, I like when you are the one who feels like it. I feel proud of this body of mine when you feel attracted to it. \"\nAs Luna expressed the thoughts she genuinely carried, Austin heated the knife before burning the venom which was plaguing around Luna's collarbone down to her chest.\nIt seemed the venom was highly toxic since, although Luna tried to negate its spread and effect, the mark and the outer impact were still actively working on her skin.\n\"It makes me look ugly, no? \"\nLuna asked without glancing down, nor did her facial expression change; even a heated knife was operating on her right now.\n\"Nothing can make my Luna ugly. Don't dare to insult my Luna; you drunk Luna. \"\nAustin complained playfully as he finished cleaning up real soon, and after applying the special antiseptic, he covered her with a band-aid.\nAs he was about to get up and get rid of his equipment, Luna hugged his torso, as after hiding her face, she mumbled under her breath.\n\"Darling.\"\nAustin sensed the peculiar emotion blended in her voice as, with a defeated smile, he sat back and let Luna get comfortable in his embrace.\n\"Do you like that woman? \"\nIt wasn't a mystery to know whom Luna was talking about since he could sense the insecurity Luna had been suffering from since Austin reunited with his sister.\n\"I don't think Saya is anything more than a little sister. I can't deny that she is precious to me as you are, Luna. But your place in my heart is unmovable. I love you and will do until my last breath, that's what I promised you before, and this statement hasn't altered the slightest bit. \"\nAustin's tone was unwavering, as well as his words which made the point he stated to feel more certain to anyone who would have heard.\n\"Then prove it...\"\nAustin raised his brows when suddenly Luna held her head toward him and said something which Austin wouldn't have imagined in his dreams until now...\n\"Tonight, impregnate me. I want to become the mother of your child Austin, and this is not something I am saying in a fuzzy mind since it's crucial for me too. So tonight, let's make a lot of love and give birth to a sweet little life. \"\n_______________________\nA/N: - I know they both are teenagers but let me remind you, Austin was in his twenties back in his previous life, and as for Luna then, she is waaaaaay older than Austin. So don't complain and let the story continue~",

I received your gratitude, so please join your friends.\"\nAustin gestured toward the group of three consisting of Sicily, Kyouki, and Lilia, before he took Luna's hand and walked away.\nIt seemed that Lilia also wanted to walk forward and thank Austin, but she was too nervous to utter a single thing, so she stayed behind Kyouki's back with her gaze only fixated on her ex-fiancè.\nIt was strange, but Austin has changed in a way that makes Lilia believe that either the previous Austin, who always behaved savagely, was fake or he just have developed as in person after meeting Luna.\nShe leaned on the second possibility.\n'It seemed you aren't the one unworthy of me rather... '\nHalting her useless thoughts which she knew would lead to nowhere, Lilia along with the others, went to have her evening tea as they chatted about various things.\nLuna, along with Austin, sat at the last dining table, which was devoid of students. Since due to the war and what happened because of Saya, almost 90% of the student have returned home for vacations, so the cafèteria was practically barren.\n\"Wait here. I will get something to eat.\"\nLuna just nodded weakly since she seemed to be exhausted for some reason. If one was to look closely around her nape, then one might guess what activity kept her awake for 13 long hours.\nOnly after they were spent in various ways did they snuggle closely and sleep for only some hours before hunger awoke Luna around five in the evening.\nAustin returned not so long after with two trays full of food which Luna liked.\nHer oceanic eyes sparkled upon gazing at the delicacies as her previous grogginess swept away in an instant.\n\"Thank you for the food.\"\nAs she said, she grabbed the fork and instantly pierced it through some lettuce and pieces of grilled chicken pieces, and after dipping it in some peculiar sauce, she started munching it merrily.\n\"Yum~Yum~.\"\nThis side of Luna, who enjoys small things like she has been having the best time of her life, was only limited to Austin since she didn't like to show her real self to anyone.\nAustin enjoyed the sight while sipping on his roasted bean coffee when suddenly the fork which was being used to feed Luna was extended toward him.\nAustin accepted such lovely gesture as he also admitted that, indeed, the salad was excellent.\n\"We shared an indirect kiss, fufu~.\"\nLuna giggled as she continued eating the other things, and also, in between several bites, she didn't forget to feed Austin too.\nAustin being fed like this did feel like something a couple does, but he was more concerned about Luna's appetite, so he asked after the seventh serving.\n\"I can get myself something if I feel like it. So don't worry about me and eat.\"\n\"No... No... No. This onee-san ca-\"\nLuna was about to say something, which she usually does whenever she serves Austin in some ways, but her voice broke down because of something she remembered from the last night.\nAustin was perplexed only for a second, but after seeing the reddening ears of the girl, he also realized what had come over her.\n\"What happened, Onee-san? Did you, by chance, remember something?\"\n\"Don't say it, Austin!\"\nLuna was on the verge of tearing up as she hid her face behind her palms as the image of something embarrassing kept ringing in her mind.\n\"But I thought you like to take the lead-\"\nAustin was about to say further when he saw Luna's drooping gaze, which had small tears on the corner, as she tucked his sleeve in a cute plea.\n\"Please don't talk about it, Austin. I will die of embarrassment.\"\nAustin's heart leaped as he saw such a vulnerable sight of Luna, which was very rare of her to show.\nAnd as expected of a man who is weak to cute things.\nHe sealed his lips.\nThanks to the sudden change in everyone's movement around, the awkwardness between the couple subdued within a second.\nThe students, along with the cafeteria in charge and Kyouki's group too, stood up from their seats like someone prominent had entered the hall.\nOnly after, when the golden armored soldier appeared in front of Austin and Luna, they realized this sudden weight in the atmosphere.\nEven identifying the bellman from the royal court, neither of the two stood up.\nThe messenger wasn't bothered by such misbehave as he didn't have the authority to point it out, so he carried out the duty he was bestowed to.\n\"Sir Austin. Your highness has summoned you to the Royal Court with the subject to extend gratitude for saving Eden Academy and providing assistance in difficult times.\"\n\"Okay.\"\n\"Eh? Yes, thank you for your time.\"\nThe royal messenger became baffled by such an instant response from Austin, but soon he coughed, and after bowing, he marched away along with the two soldiers who came with him.\nEvery gaze was fixated on Austin as being called to royal court was no joke. Even Kyouki only had been called once when he entered the Academy, but now someone who was previously disowned from his family was summoned before the Emperor.\nIt was indeed a memorable day.\n\"You nervous?\"\nAs Luna sliced the honey bread, she asked Austin in a serene tone.\n\"Well, to be honest, no. I knew this day would come, when the first time, I decided to go into the limelight. What about you? Want to tag along?\"\nAustin felt what he said. He didn't have much expectation from Gram, nor was he hoping for something. He did everything to fulfill his desire to save Saya, and now, when everything was over, he cared about nothing other than those who were close to him.\n\"I want to see my Austin getting honored, but I won't be around for some days.\"\nA frown appeared on Austin's face as he tilted his head in perplexion.\n\"You are going somewhere?\"\nWithout turning her head, Luna answered with a slight smile.\n\"Yes. Grandma has called me.\"\n_____________________\nA/N: - A new phase.",

Didn't you say that you consider your grandma as your sole family member?\"\nThe unusually silent dining hall of Eden Academy, which was filled with not more than thirty students, sat the couple consisting of a charming blond youth and a beautiful silver-haired maiden.\nAustin already had his fill from the serving Luna fed him. But Luna was far from finished as she asked Austin, to get her another filling of salad and dessert, which the latter obliged without any trouble.\n(A/N: - A little spoilt Luna is cute too;)\nAustin asked this after almost twenty minutes since the announcement from the envoy of the royal court. Luna said that she was summoned by her Grandma, which threw Austin into deep contemplation, resulting in this sudden query.\n\"Hmm..yeah, I did. Why do you ask?\"\nLuna finished the last fruit tart as she asked, even though she had some idea what Austin was thinking.\n\"I mean, shouldn't I introduce myself as your lover? If it's only okay with you to let me meet her.\"\nAustin wanted to offer his formal greeting to the only person Luna dearly adores since he wants to take things thoroughly with her. But to become an unnecessary burden on Luna would be the last thing he wants; that's why he added the last phrase.\nLuna saw through his worries and determination, which moved her heart and brought a smile to her face. But sadly, she has to decline him.\n\"I do want to let you two meet since you both are very important parts of my life, but sadly Grandma has only called me. Knowing her, I am certain she knows my relationship with you, but the reason why she specifically only called me is still a mystery. So sorry, darling. \"\nLuna held his hand as she apologized since this matter wasn't something she could bring Austin into. Until she wasn't sure what her Grandma thought about him, she couldn't let Austin come in front.\nIt wasn't about Austin's worth or anything related to it. Instead, her grandma has a twisted personality which even Luna fears; that is why she decided to keep things up to her for now.\n\"Is that so? Well, no problem. I will wait for her to call me so I can take you from her.\"\nLuna's inner thoughts, which were turning a little heavy, lifted all of a sudden as she heard her darling confessing so boldly, which made her face lit up.\n\"...no fair.\"\n\"Hmm? You said something?\"\n\"Nothing. Ah yeah, what about your system? The mission was accomplished, right? Did something happen after that?\"\nThe time for weekly requirement would have collapsed today, but thankfully it was attained at times when Austin never expected it.\n\"It was filled when Saya recognized me as her brother. I don't know why such a thing happened and also...\nAs he said, his eyes went toward the system screen, which he brought up with a single command.\n[System Evolving]\n[83.85%....]\n[All the Active skills would be frozen until the system doesn't evolve. Inventory would be accessible.]\n\"..it seems something is changing in the system. \"\nAustin was slightly worried about the skills he earned from the system, like the [Silent Mind], which always helps him keep his cool, but even if they don't return, he won't become vulnerable since his elemental trait doesn't derive from the system.\n\"Well, that's that. Since you don't intend to play villain, which I still think you never became, the system's concern is now fruitless. \"\nAustin narrowed his gaze, but Luna ignored it since she was confident with what she said.\nBut soon, he sighed in defeat since he knew Luna's standards were high, which he didn't want to attain in this field. Bringing his hand toward her face, Austin cupped her cheek.\nLuna wholeheartedly accepted the caress as she leaned her face and enjoyed her favorite warmth.\n\"Are you leaving soon? \"\n\"Hmm.Just some minutes. \"\nAnother sigh left Austin's lips which Luna knew what was about as she parted her eyelids and spoke in a loving tone.\n\"I know you will miss me, so don't look at other girls. And until I return, don't venture into a strange place, okay? \"\n\"Hmm.\"\n\"And don't forget to send me mana mail every hour when I leave. I will send you too. \"\nAustin raised his brows upon hearing the absurd request.\n\"Isn't it too much? Make it once a day. \"\n\"No, at least once every four hours. And that final. \"\nEven her words sounded domineering, her eyes were moistened and finger pinching his shirt hem, like she was begging for it. Austin was astonished at how someone could betray their words by making such undeniable expressions.\nLeaning forward, he closed his eyes and let his head connect to hers as he whispered their parting words.\n\"I'll miss you, Luna. \"\n\"I'll miss you too, darling~.\"\n________________________\n\"Waaah! Onii-sama is going to get a medal. I am super hyped for it! \"\nAfter Austin bid his farewell for a short period to his beloved, he walked to the dorm where Luna lived. Since Luna was practically cohabitating with Austin now, Saya was given Luna's room.\nAfter Saya ate the food Austin brought from the cafèteria, he told her about the envoy and summoning message from the royal court.\nBeing an ideal sister, Saya was naturally thrilled to hear his brother being honored in front of others and his actual worth being praised.\n\"Well, I really don't like being the center of attraction, but since I am doubtful of something, I better check it out. \"\nSaya shrugged the severe kind of stuff his brother brought up as her whole attention was centered on the glory Austin would receive and how handsome he would look while wearing the formal clothing.\nWait...\n\"Onii-sama. Do you have that heavy and formal attire for the ceremony? \"\nUpon hearing Saya's query, Austin raised his brows, but soon he concluded his answer.\n\"No, I don't. \"\nSuddenly Saya's eyes sparkled as it seemed she had found the prettiest treasure right in front of her doorstep.\nHolding Austin's hand, she spoke in an energetic tone.\n\"Then tomorrow is a date. It's a promise, okay? I am so excited~.\"\n_____________________\nA/n: - Some bonding time.",

      "content": "\"The weather is so lovely~ Even the Sky God is supporting our date, Onii-sama!\"\nAs Saya chimed while holding Austin's arm, the people in the surroundings glanced at the duo with confusion clouding their minds.\nSaya was undoubtedly a mature beauty with a great figure equally proportionate, but when walking with the blond youth, she gave an impression of an older sister.\nHowever, her spoilt behavior, along with the way she called Austin, made various wonder whether this couple was into some perverted play?\n\"Well, I am happy that you are enjoying it.\"\nAustin wasn't bothered at all by what the others were thinking or the looks they received. Seeing his sister smile was the most he could keep his attention upon.\nThe market they came to today was in one of the Gram's cities, Seneur, under the province of Duke Snyset. This place was near the main capital and Eden's Academy, too, just like a junction. So Austin chose the place where he could reach using levitation in minimal time.\nThe marketplace of Seneur was famous for textiles and the delicacies it serves. And since this duo was interested in both specialties, this place worked as a golden coincidence.\nThe shopping district was in hustle even though it was only 10 in the morning. It felt like not only Austin got the idea to shop today, but various others were also preparing for something.\nMost of the public came here in their carriage or royal transportation, signifying the grandeur of the shopping hub.\n\"Should we take a tour before moving to the clothes department?\"\nAustin proposed the idea, which Saya wholeheartedly accepted while nodding her head in a strong momentum.\nWith his forearm still being held dearly by his sister, just like she did in the past life, they both started walking deeper into the market.\nEven though her appearance was different and also the aura she possesses now, these small gestures made Austin elated that even though so many things happened, Saya hadn't changed in person.\n\"What happened, Onii-sama?\"\nFinding her brother's eyes on her, Saya blushed slightly as she asked in fear that her makeup might have been unsightly.\n\"Nothing. I just realized that you still are my little Saya.\"\nUpon hearing her brother's not-so-pleasant remark, a slight bulge appeared on Saya's left cheek as she subconsciously pressed her bountiful bosom on Austin's arm.\n\"Mou~ Calling Saya kid is no fair, Onii-sama. I am angry here, you know!\"\nThe pout changed into the complaint as she now voluntarily tried to make Austin embarrass by pressing her breast until his arm wasn't engulfed in between them.\nAustin was laughing at the sight as he genuinely didn't pay single attention to the warmth spreading on his arm; rather his whole attention was fixated on his sister's cute protest.\n\"Okay, Saya isn't little anymore. Come on; I think you will like it.\"\nSaya, still being a little grumpy, followed her brother's lead before a paradise greeted her.\n\"Waaaaaaahhh!\"\nAustin bought something from the shop, which had a front counter.\nFrom outer covering and texture, it looked like crèpe, which got better of Saya'a patience as she took the first bite.\n\"Mmmmm~Yummm~.\"\nShe was extremely thrilled with the soft cream filling along with the sweetness of fruit jellies and also the crunchy outer wrapper. It was just too good to exist.\nLittle did she notice the reaction of the people around, who got so mesmerized by the sight of a beautiful and charming woman enjoying the confection.\nSlowly, the amount of customers started increasing as in to experience what threw the raven-haired into such an ecstatic state.\nFortunately, Austin was already done paying as he also bought one for himself, which had the fragrance of bitterness of coffee blended with the essence of vanilla.\n'I can't tell what actually is it... '\nAustin was about to taste it when he saw the current expression on Saya, which completely betrayed the face she had some moments ago.\n\"Do all girls like sweet things, or you and Luna are just the special case? Confection really does put you both in a good mood.\"\nSaya blushed heavily upon showing such a childish side even when she protested against it some minutes ago. But she couldn't deny her love for sweet things; that was why she loved her Onii-sama too. He's the sweetest, after all.\n\"Don't put me in the same category as that woman, Onii-sama. Ah, by the way, where is she?\"\nSaya was happy that Luna didn't interrupt their date and stayed away for the time being, but knowing how crazy Luna is for Austin, Saya found it a sign of some hazard incoming.\n\"She...she has gone somewhere for some days.\"\nThere was apparent grief in Austin's voice which Saya also noticed, but she wasn't a naive girl to declare herself as a substitute for Luna. Austin would hate her if she said something like that.\nSo, Saya chose to ask something which she had been contemplating about since the day she reunited with her brother, in order to change the flow of conversation.\n\"Onii-sama...please don't mind if you don't want to answer, but can I ask what Luna-san's origin is. Like I am confident in my strength and especially when it comes to combat, but that day...\"\nSince Austin had his arm intervene with Saya, he could feel the shiver running down her body as she continued after a slight pause.\n\"She practically was toying with me. For the first time, I had to doubt whether I was living in the same world as this entity in front. I felt utterly hopeless, Onii-sama. Luna-san isn't just any mage, that's for sure, but I doubt how a single human can even hold that much strength altogether?\"\n\"So you are suggesting that Luna isn't human?\"\nSaya's eyes went wide as it seemed her curiosity made her words utterly rude which led Austin to draw such a conclusion.\n\"I am extremely sorry, Onii-sama. I didn't want to say such a thing about her.\"\nAustin wasn't upset in the first place, and truth be told, he also have thought something similar to what Saya just suggested.\nBut...\n\"Well, even if she is a human or not, I love her regardless. Luna is an existence who cannot leave my heart even if I have to face the whole world to stay by her side.\"\nThe shine in his eyes, the honesty of his words, and the determination in his voice made Saya a little sad since it wasn't directed at her, but she was proud of her brother nonetheless.\nSaya does respect Luna since she carries the strength worthy of being the strongest and the love she holds for her brother. That was why Saya even accepted to back off after a year since she knew that if not for her, Luna was the only one who could make her Onii-sama happy.\n\"Y-You stop right there, big-booby demon!!\"\nA feminine yet enraged voice came from the duo's back which naturally gathered the attention of the others too.\nTurning toward the source of voice after glancing at each other in perplexion, they saw two women standing there.\nAustin knew one of them, as he muttered under his breath.\n\"Vanessa?\"\n_____________________\nA/N: - Drama incoming.\nAnd yeah for advance chapter: -\nhttps://zetrotranslation.com/novel/isnt-the-wannabe-villain-too-cute/",

      "content": "\"Battle me, right here and right now! You hear me!\"\nAs Venessa approached the brother-sister duo, she shouted at the top of her lungs with rage filling her amber eyes without minding the gazes she was receiving from the surrounding.\nAustin raised his brows toward the woman on the back, who looked like the adult version of Venessa, as she seemed to calm her daughter down but failed pitifully.\nSaya had a blank look on her face as she saw the little girl approaching her before she asked in genuine curiosity.\n\"...Who?\"\nVanessa's steps came to an abrupt halt as a look of complete disbelief instantly dyed her face.\nAs soon she registered, the raven-haired woman just said, a thick vein popped on her forehead, with lips twitching in annoyance.\n\"Y-You!!!\"\nBefore Venessa could have launched toward the arrogant woman in front, Austin came in between before anything irreversible could have taken place.\n\"Calm down, Venessa. We are in a public place. Not everyone is used to experiencing intent here.\"\nAs his word traveled, Venessa was pulled out of her stupor as she realized that, indeed, the marketplace was filled with a variety of people who might not be a mana-user.\nInstantly self-reflecting, she pulled back the blood lust she had been drawing subconsciously.\n\"It seems you both know each other, so why not take this conversation somewhere private?\"\nAustin proposed the idea since it seemed she wouldn't let go of Saya this easily.\n\"Fine by me.\"\n\"Me too, only if Onii-sama is also coming. \"\nSaya was utterly unbothered and chimed like an energy ball, making Venessa irritated and baffled simultaneously. Not so many days ago, Venessa saw the complete emotionless war doll, but now the way Saya behaved seemed she was seeking her brother's attention.\n'Wait, when did he become a brother of her...?'\nVanessa held the question to herself as she, with Saya beside her, started walking to the nearby cafè.\nAustin turned toward the woman for the first time as he saw her sighing toward her daughter.\n\"It's an honor to meet Madame Elizabeth Charles in person for the first time. My name is Austin. Pleased to meet you.\"\nAustin brought his hand on his chest before bowing slightly and greeting the woman he once saw in a book in the school library.\n\"You seem to know me. A warrior being interested in herbs is quite rare. Anyway, it's nice to meet you too, Sir Austin.\"\nThe reason she said so was simply the field in which she was famous. Herbs and potions were her fortè, and before marrying Charles Sinton, Elizabeth worked in the Eden Academy as a professor.\nWithout any further words, both of them exchanged a glance before they also walked inside the cafè.\nElizabeth, by appearance, looked gorgeous enough to stand out in the crowd with her long fiery hair, which was depicted like an actual burning flame, with a figure completely denying her real age, which was around early forties.\nBoth Charles and Elizabeth loved each other since their teenage even though they didn't attend school together, and only after they became well accomplished in their life make the decision to marry and have a child the very next year.\nVarious thoughts about how such a delicate-looking woman married such a burly man, but there are those too who thought of them as a perfect couple who compliments each other in various ways.\nIn contrast to the mature beauty both Saya and Elizabeth carried, Venessa was entirely shadowed as every gaze was glancing at those adult females every once in a while.\nUnbothered by all this, the group of four took a table at the corner, which was slightly less noisy and comparatively less in the populace.\n\"Wh-what would you like to order, dear customers.\"\nIt seemed the midget waiter was intimated by the women as he stuttered those lines, which he practically pronounced a hundred times daily.\n\"I will take a coffee without sugar, thanks.\"\nAustin made his request signifying how used he was to order the same beverage.\n\"Me too, same as Onii-sama.\"\n\"I-If she's going to order, then me too. Coffee, please!\"\nSaya orders the same thing to match Austin's taste and have same things in common. Vanessa's order was simply just to compete with her rival.\n\"No, Venessa, your stomach cannot handle caffeine. Mr. Waiter, put a simple chocolate shake for her and for me a cup of tea.\"\n\"Mama....\"\nVanessa tried to protest as she sensed the sneer coming from the person opposite her, but Elizabeth wasn't in the mood to listen to her daughter at all.\n\"And you too, Saya. I remember you lose your appetite after drinking tea or coffee. So put a fruit juice for her. Thank you.\"\n\"Onii-sama....\"\nThis time Saya pouted as she received a smirk from opposite her. But Austin as well, just smiled at her; however, he didn't have any intention to change the order.\nIn the end, the two silently accepted their guardians' outright rejection.\n\"So, how come you both know each other?\"\nAustin asked since he wasn't sure when Saya left the dorm or whether she had met Venessa before reuniting with him. He completely forgot about the fact that before meeting him, Saya came to Gram for her mission.\n\"I really don't know her, Onii-sama. I just have a vague recollection of someone cursing me with the same face as her.\"\n\"Rejoice that I was injured that day, or instead of a curse, I would have directed something more lethal that day.\"\n\"Yeah... Yeah. Whatever.\"\n\"Huh?! Are you taking me as a fool?!\"\nSeeing the rising temperature around the table, Elizabeth pulled her daughter before she could have jumped to fight.\n\"Calm down Nes. You still aren't properly well, so leave the fighting and brawling after you recover.\"\nVanessa didn't say anything just crossed her arm under her bosom and turned her head in frustration.\n\"So, you both are here to shop today?\"\nElizabeth, to lighten up the mood, asked Austin, which the latter understood very well and answered with the same motive.\n\"Yeah, preparation for the ceremony. And what about you two?\"\n\"We also are shopping for Nes' formal gown for the ceremony. Since it's her first time in the royal court, I plan to decorate my daughter like a doll.\"\n\"I am not going to dress like that!\"\nVanessa protested, but the smile on Elizabeth's charming face told how lightly she took the plea.\n\"You are invited too, Venessa?\"\n\"Umm... Yeah. And not only me but all those who contributed the most in the war. You didn't know?\"\nAustin slightly shook his head since he wasn't aware of anything about it. In a way, he was thankful that he wouldn't become the only piece of attraction in the court.\n\"Ah, that reminds me, Austin...\"\nSuddenly Elizabeth tapped on the table before the surrounding became utterly frozen.\nAustin's eyes went wide as he sensed that other than him and the mature beauty in front, everyone was unmoving as time had halted for them altogether.\n'Time magic barrier? '\nAustin gasped in astonishment since all these things happened so suddenly that he never got the time to registered it completely.\nOnly did Elizabeth continue to talk did Austin come back to himself, but when he heard her, Austin's mind went blank.\n\"...when are you going to marry my daughter?\"\n________________________\nA/N: - Dangerous mages popping out of nowhere.

      "content": "\"Pfft. I am just joking, Austin. Don't be so stiff.\"\nIt was fortunate that Elizabeth laughed off to clear the joke before it could have become a misunderstanding.\nAustin was so stunned by her words that he completely forgot about the barrier surrounding them.\nEven the crimson-haired woman laughed off the topic; Austin felt it an opportunity to clear the matter since he found the chance.\n\"Madame Elizabeth, I know it would sound rude, but -\"\n\"You can't marry my daughter since you love someone else. I know that already.\"\nAustin nodded just in affirmation and thanked the fortune that, unlike her husband and daughter, Elizabeth was quite understanding and cool-headed.\n\"First of all, I would like to apologize for my husband's irrational decision, which forced you into this relationship.\"\nSeeing Elizabeth bow in apology, Austin became a little flustered since even though the engagement was non-consensual, being apologized by such a prominent figure was still over the top.\n\"Please raise your head Ma'am. I know under what state of mind Sir Charles took that decision, so I don't blame him. Also, Venessa and I already had a conversation about this relationship, so you don't have to feel burdened.\"\nAustin spoke in a little hurry before Elizabeth finally looked toward her front with a warm smile adorning her charming face.\n\"You really are a nice person Austin, just like Nes told me about.\"\nOn just reflexes, Austin raised his brows toward Venessa before he muttered under his breath.\n\"She did? \"\n\"Well, in the first four months of school, she told me that there's a perverted bastard she hates dearly, but in recent days, her statement has started to shift, Austin. \"\nHearing her remark, which seemed genuine for some reason, Austin became a little surprised since Venessa might be the person from whom he had received the most Villain's Point until Luna didn't enter his life.\n\"Maybe my little warrior judged someone from their face value; that's why she came to know your true self after you saved her. But what can we expect from someone in her teenage youth? Anyway, Austin, I have a request to make.\"\nHer voice was warm and subtle from the start as she told what she felt in all honesty. Being a good judge of people is something that comes from experience. That's why her daughter couldn't see what kind of person Austin was before.\nIn the end, her voice grew deeper and desperate as Austin also frowned slightly before nodding for her to continue.\n\"Can you just, for this ceremony, act as Nes' fiancé?\"\nAustin's eyes went slightly wide since he wasn't expecting such a request when Elizabeth just apologized because of the same thing.\nBut he wasn't impetuous to just outright reject her, so he chose to hear her out first.\n\"Can I know the reason?\"\n\"I know this is nothing but just my utter selfishness, but I want to protect my husband's pride. I promise on my name, that once that idiot returns, I will make him cancel this engagement by taking full responsibility for this occurrence, but for just this social gathering, can you play the role of my future son-in-law?\"\nAustin, from start to end, heard each syllable and registered it accordingly. It wasn't tough for him to discern what she was protecting here.\nTo keep Charles' words which he declared in front of practically the whole Gram through the well-known figures of the empire, Elizabeth was asking Austin to act, which he never actually accepted.\nIf he would never have received the system or have met Luna in his life, he might have agreed to the request. But now...\n\"I understand what you just said. But I have to kindly decline your request since pretending to be your daughter's fiancé would make me feel like I am betraying the person I love. So sorry, madame Elizabeth, I won't be able to maintain this lie.\"\nElizabeth's expression visibly shifted, but instead of disappointment, it was more than she just did something horrible.\nWith her head slightly leaning down, she understood what she wasn't able to before.\n\"I am incredibly shameful for pushing you to the edge, Austin. It seems to be with that muscle head, I also have lost some sense of reasoning. In blindness to save my husband's pride, I never realized what boundaries I have tried to breach.\"\nAustin again thanked God for conversing with such a thoughtful person despite having the surname Charles.\n\"It's okay, Madame Elizabeth. Since I know what heights one goes to in love, I can fully understand how you feel.\"\nElizabeth didn't respond immediately, but with a smile, she tapped on the table to dispel the barrier as she spoke something which she only was able to hear.\n\"I hope I can find someone like you for my daughter as well, Austin.\"\n_______________________\nAt the same time, in a faraway place which was covered in the pitch white of snow, could be seen a figure of a teenage girl walking through the cold blizzard, but completely unbothered by the weather.\nThis person was none other than the one who was bestowed with the title of Humanity's hope and the famous Saintess of Gram, Luna Lastov, or currently Luna Eldritch.\nLuna was presently in her birthland since her Grandma strangely called the meeting place in Aurora.\nFinally, after reaching a certain distance, Luna's eyes sparkled in a cyan radiance before she could figure out the illusionary barrier surrounding the vicinity.\nWith a smirk forming on her pale yet beautiful face, Luna chanted the Dispell before a gateway was created for her to breach inside.\nIf any other barrier had faced her Dispell, then it might have disintegrated without leaving a trace, but this barrier wasn't conjured by just any mage.\n'Woah! '\nLuna's eyes sparkled as the scenery inside the barrier was too good to be true.\nSince she had seen only pitch white after entering the Northern Territory, and until the time she found this place, the greenery inside the barrier made Luna gasp in admiration.\nNot only that, even a lake was formed in the middle of the place, with some creatures roaming in and out of the forest while observing the intruder in their world.\nThe atmosphere was so calm and serene that the first thing that came to her mind was...\n'I must come here with Austin next time. '\nHer train of thought came to an abrupt halt as she felt mortal danger approaching her with a furious pace before she elevated in the air and dodged whatever came from her back.\nWhen Luna's eyes fell on the thing which passed from the place where she was standing, she sighed in defeat.\n\"If thrown with the intent, even a leaf can become a lethal danger.\"\nThe voice from her back made Luna enthralled since she very well was aware of whom it belonged.\nTurning enthusiastically, Luna saw a woman in her early twenties standing in mid-air just three inches apart from her; even her voice sounded so distant just now.\nBut she wasn't surprised by it all, as the cold and indifferent Saintess jumped in her grandmother's embrace just like any other normal child does.\n\"Grandma!\"\n\"Ah, I missed you so much, Luna.\"\n_______________________________\nA/N: - Sorry, for the short chapter.

      "content": "[Luna, 's Pov:]\nWhen I was six years old, I came to Gram for the first time in my life, and also, it was the first time I left the castle which made me suffocate the most.\nAs I remember, it was the tenth birthday of the second prince Mikhail, for which the three of the neighboring continents were invited to the central Empire to celebrate the big event.\nI wasn't enthusiastic about it since I wasn't sure what I was getting dragged in. I mean, what could you expect from a six years old child? I was already happy to see the greenery and new kind of people as our carriage moved for days and nights toward the Golden City.\n(A/N: - Gram is also called the City of Gold because its palace is made up of nothing but gold.)\nBut on the route toward the capital, an unexpected occurrence stirred up the situation and also my life from then.\nA horde of nomad monsters engaged in a gory battle in which Northern Emperor, Norsvolk had also to cross his blade in the end.\nI was frightened when the defense started falling out as I got out of the carriage since anxiety was clouding my reasonability.\nI still could vaguely remember the scene which was unfolding before I ran away in the jungle as a loud eruption also started flaring from the battle side for some reason.\nAs I remembered, none of the monsters were capable of causing such massive explosions, but somehow the battlefield became a sea of flames before I lost sight of where I was heading to.\nI was too scared at that time. It was my first to see such brutality, after all. I was naive to believe that the world was a fairy tail where my prince would rescue me at times of trouble, and we would get a happy ending.\nBut nothing goes how one desires them to.\nWhat happened afterward, I couldn't remember. Some animals were chasing me, and my uncontrollable tears and the fear I felt were only hazy in my memories since something more prominent of that day have deeply engraved in my remembrance.\nThe meeting with my grandma.\nShe came into my life as an unexpected support which helped me again to stand up and face the reality.\nI didn't know where I was or what had happened to my father since I met grandma, nor I actually cared. The space where we both were, simply defied a general human's comprehensibility.\nBut since this was far greater than the palace where I lived, my chicken-sized mind chose to stay with grandma and listen to more stories she had in store.\nI thanked that I was less calculating at that time. That's why I was able to accept the middle-aged woman quite easily.\nWell, there was something that made me connect to her.\nOur loneliness.\nEven though she said to stay for some days with her in that unnatural space, I never imagined it would end almost a hundred years.\nAt first, I only ate, slept, heard stories, and repeated. But soon, I started playing with the mythical creatures inside the jungle. And without me realizing it, I was getting proficient with mana even though I didn't have officially awakened at that time.\nI wasn't aware that I was growing up since my body was still the same, but from what Grandma told me when I left her, I actually trained my mana along with the creatures for more than ten years.\nHow absurd it sounds; I actually just cultivated mana and regulated it through each cell of my body in the span of one decade.\nOnce I started getting aware that something was wrong with the compatibility of my mind and body, I was thrown by my grandma into rigorous training.\nFor the next fifty years, Grandma did nothing but forge me into a warrior. I still can remember how days and nights passed when I was given tasks. Sometimes I fought unknown things for days in order to accomplish my goal, and sometimes I got beaten down until I fell on the verge of death.\nGrandma was ruthless, and so she was making me too. And for some reason I didn't hate that.\nI was aware that as time passed and I accepted the unnatural mana of the place, I was losing my humanity. But it seemed the incident which led me met my grandma left a great impact on my mind since I thought of the outside world as nothing but filled with brutality and blood. And that belief helped to never stop.\nWithout even a moment of boredom, hundred years went by, and I was completely ready to face the world which I had created my fear against.\nBut little did I expect that the outside world was still the same as I left it...\n_________________\n\"Someone is smiling quite a lot today.\"\nIn the same forest where Luna came to meet her Grandma, in the Northern Empire, sat two women under a humongous towering tree.\nThe older one was currently braiding Luna's long silver as she saw her granddaughter smiling wordlessly.\n\"I was just thinking, what would happen if I tell Austin my real age.\"\nLuna was at least had that much faith in her love, that Austin wouldn't hate her if she told him what the difference between their actual age was.\n\"Don't be silly, girl. That guy is completely drowned in your love. I doubt if there's anything related to you that can make him hate you, now.\"\nLuna smiled with her eyes unfocused as the image of Austin's smiling face came into her vision as she thought about what he might be doing now.\nAnother reason for her happiness was her acceptance from her grandma for Austin.\nLuna took a whole night to tell her over-protective grandma how reliable and caring her man is and how much they love each other. Fortunately, her Grandma had already accepted Austin as her grandson-in-law before Luna's arrival.\n\"You think so?\"\nA blush made way on Luna's cheeks as she asked what she already knew. But to hear that Austin is crazy for her would never be enough for her.\n\"Of course he is; otherwise, who would have ignored such lovely temptation when you aren't around.\"\nLuna's eyes went slightly wide as she turned toward her grandma, only to see her eyes shining with illumination, which made her realize what the heck actually was going on.\n\"Grandma, stop spying on him!\"\nThe Sakura-haired woman smiled heartily to see such a reaction from Luna before she disconnected the channel.\nLooking at Luna's troubled expression, which her grandma undoubtedly knew what was about, she spoke in a meek tone.\n\"You want to know?\"\nLuna averted her gaze when she realized that she had been found out. But in the end, the shy maiden in love couldn't endure, as she asked in a small whisper.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Fufu...Don't make that face, Luna. He is pretty much ignoring his sister's temptation like a pro and also has rejected a proposal that genuinely has impressed me.\"\nDespite being curious about the proposal thing, Luna decided to hear it directly from Austin, as she sat back with a full-bloom smile on her face.\n\"You really love Austin, don't you.\"\nLuna didn't reply, just kept her face drowned in embarrassment with a shy smile not leaving her lips.\nBut suddenly, her grandma spoke something which made the atmosphere grow heavier, and her mind went blank at once.\n\"But Luna, I want to warn you something related to that boy. I fear that maybe you might have to leave him one day.\"\n\"!!!\"\n__________________________\nA/N: - This chapter will continue from this point. The day Luna met her grandma would get a side story since it contains significant relevance to the main plot.\nUntil then✌️",

But as it suggests, one could only dive until they don't suffocate.\nThis is an inheritance skill that allows users to foresee the future. Enable them to surveillance specific surroundings according to the user's capability. Also, it works as a top-notch appraiser. There are various other use of Third Eye which the mage warrior Sicily and also Luna's Grandma carries.\nThere are very rare cases of someone possessing Third Eye since, as stated earlier, it is an inheritance which the bloodline could only carry. Thievery and transplant were never an option.\nNow what, Luna's grandma saw in her vision about Austin. And what made her suggest that Luna should stay away from her love for her own safety, was yet to be told.\n---------------\n\"Gr-Grandma?\"\n\"I know how you are feeling, Luna, but please hear me to the end.\"\nThe middle-aged woman calmed her granddaughter as she saw Luna panicking as soon those words left her lips.\nIt was understandable from Luna's reaction that being apart from Austin is her worst nightmare. If anyone had said it, Luna would have ignored them or might have shut their mouth forcibly.\nHowever, these words weren't spoken by not just anyone but her own grandma, whom Luna couldn't ignore.\nNodding her head, Luna sat while facing the woman as she heard what she never was aware of.\n\"It wasn't the first time I have spied on that blondie, but the first time, I still couldn't forget about it.\"\nLuna frowned severely as she heard the all-time cheery grandma speaking in such a profound tone.\n\"There is a shadow roaming on his whole presence. Since his birth, this presence having a close watch on Austin. Not only that, the reason why Austin has been misunderstood since quite early in his life is also because of that strange presence. It seems that the dark existence can manipulate others too, to think that whatever the blondie does, is with evil intent.\"\nLuna's eyes were slightly narrowed with minimal space between her brows as she heard each syllable of her grandma and registered it accordingly.\nLuna already had done a full body scan of Austin at times when they were in Xylex, but she never found any kind of curse or invisible artifact present on him.\nSuddenly, the sakura-haired woman dispelled an illusionary spell from her left hand, which burnt her skin until it turned into wrinkly dark matter.\n\"Gr-Grandma th-this...?\"\nLuna's eyes went slightly wide as she saw the change in her grandma's perfect hand, which undoubtedly came from the effect of something severe.\n'But what entity could hurt... '\nLuna was unable to discern since, in her perception, her grandma was currently the strongest being she had come across.\n\"That thing is commendable more than I thought. Do you remember the incident when the Terror Rank demon suddenly erupted during your first expedition?\"\nLuna nodded twice since it was a memorable day when she and Austin came closer.\nUpon seeing her nod, the woman continued.\n\"It wasn't spontaneous. It was intentionally awoken by force. And also the red-haired girl, Charles' daughter... What's her name...?\"\nAs she pondered to find the name, Luna filled the gap hurriedly.\n\"Vanessa.\"\n\"Yes, Venessa. That girl had her thoughts turned complete 180 that day because she was under the serious effect of that thing attached to Austin. Not to talk about Austin's parents and also the Gram's Emperor himself.\"\nLuna's breathing turned slightly heavy as she, one after another, found the answers to those questions she was never able to unravel, until now.\nHer eyes wandered aimlessly for a second as she joined the knots which were missing until now when her grandma continued with her previous explanation.\n\"Thankfully, I countered that thing for the time being. Our battle was quite tenacious, and I also got this ugly scar because of it, but in the end, it was settled.\"\nWith a shine of hope rising in her oceanic eyes, Luna asked in an optimistic tone.\n\"So, did you end its existence?\"\nThe woman sighed upon seeing her granddaughter's expression as she patted her head before a disappointing answer left her lips.\n\"No, not likely. I just pushed it into a dormant stage. But I feel like the shadow had backed off temporarily on its free will and would again overwhelm people around Austin at the most vital point.\"\nLuna's heart was throbbing wildly as it seemed that the unknown entity was compelling enough to even rival her grandma. It was indeed becoming a situation where she didn't have her reach.\nIf the people surrounding Austin hurt him because of the strange shadow thing, then Luna cannot fathom how far it would have gone if she didn't come into his life.\nHow far would he have suffered? How long had he stayed in pain and let others judge him wrongly?\nLuna didn't want to even think about it. Not now, not ever.\nHe has her now. She won't let him see any darkness until she would with him. Not on her watch; anyone or anything could hurt her darling.\n\"Grandma, is there anything to counter this piece of shadow shit?\"\n\" Well, you carry my essence. Being around him is hefty to keep that shadow weak, but Luna, I want you to decide this carefully.\"\nThe look on the woman's face turned more severe than any time as she held Luna's hand and asked in a serious tone.\n\"Following that boy would lead you to a great catastrophe, and at the end of those events, the world might be seeing you both with hatred. There might not be any place to run since every single person could be on your back. Despite knowing this, are you sure you want to be with him?\"\n\"Yes, I do.\"\nLuna's answer came so abruptly that even her grandma's eyes went slightly wide in astonishment. And not only that, the sheer determination and resolute demeanor covering Luna's aura signified how certain she was with her decision.\n\"You said Austin is drowned in my love; then I am not any better, Grandma. I also love my Austin to the point where life without him makes me shiver in a fret. Even thinking about such a future where I couldn't see his smile, or feel his presence around makes me terrified. I don't know when it happened, grandma, but before I could stop myself, I already was madly dwelled in that man.\"\nThe older one liked the non-hesitant confession as she nodded affirmatively. She was undoubtedly proud of her granddaughter.\nBut there was still something she needs to fulfill.\n\"If that's your decision, I must provide you with my greatest support. So how about a decent training session, my dear Luna~.\"\nLuna's shining eyes faded in an instant as she heard a specific word before a hard gulp passed through her throat.\n\"Please go easy on me, grandma.\"\n________________\nIn front of an extravagantly decorated and shining palace stood a handsome blond youth with nervousness evidently plastered on his face.\nThe passing people were glancing at Austin once in a while since he was looking extremely eye-catching right now.\nA long coffee-shade coat with a white shirt inside it and ankle-length formal trousers of of the same shade as coat, made the youth look charming and slightly older than his actual age.\nHis usual messy hairs were now combed with a specific gel keeping them in their place. With his natural emerald eyes complimenting with his blond hair along with the formal attire made Austin the center of various attractions.\nBut the slightly dense Austin felt that his sister had made him a fool with such makeup and get-up, that was why he was getting glanced upon.\n'Should I just go back? '\nAs the thought came in his mind, someone suddenly called him from the back.\n\"Aren't you, Sir Austin?\"\n___________________\nA/N: - Drop a comment~",

      "content": "\"Aren't you, Sir Austin?\"\nTurning on reflexes since Austin had never sensed anyone coming this close to him, his eyes found a girl not older than him, standing there with a bright smile adorning her face.\nShe was about an inch shorter than Austin with shiny platinum blond hair over her head, tied in a proper braid. Wearing a beige shade gown, the girl looked extremely adorable, just like a doll, with her fluffy cheeks adorned with a slight flush as she gawked at Austin like she was witnessing something marvelous.\nAustin became slightly awkward being seen like an antique, as he asked in a neutral tone.\n\"Yes, I am. And who you could be?\"\nSince the ceremony has already commenced, given the slow music flowing from inside, there weren't many people left near the entrance, where these two were standing currently.\nUpon hearing Austin's question, the girl's eyes went round before she smiled subjectively before introducing herself.\n\"Sorry for the late introduction, Sir Austin. I am Tiara der Gramduör. First princess of Gram and also a big admirer of yours.\"\nAustin's back straightened as he learned her identity before formally introducing himself.\n\"Sorry for being rude until now, Your Highness. My name is Austin. Please to meet y- eh? Admirer?\"\nAustin's words broke in half as he raised his head with perplexion currently spread on his face. In the fluster of greeting a royalty, he registered Tiara's words quite late and so reacted accordingly.\nHearing such a late response, Tiara broke into a small laugh.\n\"How amusing you are, Austin-san. And yes, I have been an avid admirer of you for a not-so-long time.\"\nAustin tilted his head slightly to the right since he never understood what made her admire him in the first place. Austin never liked the spotlight. That's why he did everything using Kyouki's name except for the war against the demon on the Academy's ground.\nHe was pretty numb-minded at that time.\nSo being praised by such a prominent figure made him confused.\n\"Me?\"\n\"Yes, you, Austin-san. There are so many reasons that it will take a looooot of time for me to tell you. So why not we discuss it over tea sometime in the future and go inside first?\"\nAustin wasn't sure whether he would meet this princess again or not, so he just nodded casually, and as she walked up to him, Austin turned toward the entrance.\n\"Are you nervous, Sir Austin?\"\nThe curious voice, which was devoid of any hidden intent, came from the princess as Austin halted before responding.\n\"Well, not now when I talked with your highness, strangely.\"\nSpeaking of his honest thoughts, Austin was about to ask Tiara to lead the way when she entangled her arm with his and marched forward without minding Austin's perplexed expression.\n\"Y-Your Highness, wait!\"\nDespite looking frail, the princess walked with such force that she pulled Austin up to the red carpet taking advantage his bafflement.\n\"Knowing your personality, I knew you wouldn't have escorted me, Sir Austin, but when we are already under so many gazes, will you really leave my side and let my name get shamed off?\"\nThe princess whispered with her sapphire eyes shining in innocence.\nAustin's lips twitched since he felt like snatching his hand away from this plotting minx. Still, as she said, indeed, various people have already watched them, so being disrespectful here would only become a pain.\n\"I will take this honor as a gift from my avid fan, Hime-sama.\"\nThe princess just giggled in response as she saw the troubled expression on her escort's face while they entered the celebration hall.\nThe choir was playing very calming music with the bright lights spread like a beautiful sheet.\nPeople were chatting in a shallow tone to maintain the decorum of the hall as they sipped elegantly on their drinks.\nThe lighting, the decorations, and the exquisite-looking people made Austin blinded for a second before he lost when the person beside him disappeared.\nWell, even though he noticed, he was somewhat relieved.\nStanding in the middle of the hall, Austin felt a bit out of place as he walked with quiet steps toward a corner; he took a glass of fruit beer while he tried to fix his gaze on the blinding surroundings.\n'As I thought, it was a bad decision. '\nHis train of weary thoughts came to a halt as he sensed someone approaching him from his left. Turning his gaze, he found an extremely beautiful girl he was acquainted with walking in his direction.\nHer crimson dress was complimented by her amber-shade hair, with the one-piece dress adorned by her sculptured body. Her curves moved in the best way a woman could portray as she made her way beside Austin.\n\"You came alone? Where is Luna?\"\nAs Venessa asked with her eyes focused on the front, she secretly calmed her heart which seemed to beat slightly faster after seeing Austin in his current appearance.\n\"She has gone to meet her relative. What about you? Isn't Kyouki around?\"\nCelebratory event without a hero was close to impossible when it concerns Eden's Academy, so Austin's question wasn't baseless.\n\"He came with Sicily. See..there they are.\"\nAs she gestured with her eyes, Austin saw a couple consisting of a handsome black-haired youth and a charming girl who was chatting with others in quite a harmonious mood.\n\"They blend with people, quite comfortably.\"\nAustin sighed as the words leaked in slight admiration for the two since what he was bad with was his social skills. The lack of normal interaction with high-class people made him someone who instead prefers to disappear in a crowd rather than become the centerpiece of their attraction.\n\"Well weren't you a noble before? These kinds of social gatherings must be quite normal for you, no?\"\nVanessa's question was legit since before the ordeal during their first expedition, Austin was a proud son of Count Vincent. But even before that, he barely attended any gatherings since his parents didn't want to introduce him to many people.\nReason. Obvious.\nBut he wasn't going to bother telling such details to the girl, so he just countered with his own query.\n\"Isn't it the same for you? Sir Charles's social status is equivalent to an Arch Duke. Why you're in a corner with me?\"\nA blush erupted immediately on her face as Venessa glared quite timidly toward the blunt-tongued guy beside her.\nBut soon, she gathered her thoughts as she sighed in defeat and decided to speak truthfully.\n\"Well, you can say, on the battlefield, I am pretty a big-mouth, but these kinds of events just make me feel heavy. Like I don't belong here. Sometimes I feel everyone is watching me, and sometimes I feel lost even with many familiar faces around. Hmm....now I realize I am pretty strange.\"\nAustin, from start to end, felt Venessa wasn't describing herself but reading his personality and pouring them into words.\nWith his eyes slightly wide, he looked at her for quite a long half minute before he responded in a serene tone.\n\"Well, you aren't alone who thinks like that. I somehow can relate.\"\nVanessa just hummed in response before silence befell in between them.\nThe music was still flowing across the hall, with slow chattering along with occasional clinking of cutlery resonated as these two stood silently with no words traveling in between.\nSuddenly with her eyes unfocused and mind wandering in a strange direction, Venessa muttered under her breath.\n\"Hey Austin, can you tell me something honestly?\"\nAustin raised his brows for a second before answering in a neutral voice.\n\"If only to a certain extent, then yes.\"\nVanessa inhaled deeply before she asked something which she had been contemplating for a long time now. The thing which has made me quite muddled and guilty about.\n\"Were you always like this?\"\n_______________________\nA/N: - Should I continue this chapter from this point or should I just skip the event?",

      "content": "\"I can't really tell what you are referring to.\"\nIn the brightly lighted ceremonial hall inside the main palace of Gram could be seen several prominent figures conversing comfortably as the choir bestowed the hall with their calmest notes.\nThe event was organized to celebrate the memorable victory over the demons on the Gram borders as well as the overwhelming conquest on the war field of Eden Academy.\nBoth of those events were quite tenacious and something which would be remembered in the golden history of Gram, where a war Veteran and newbie student protected the place they call their home.\nThose who have provided their aid in times of catastrophe would be honored by the Emperor of Gram himself just after the celebration.\nAmidst this crowd and their slow chatting stood a pair of the incredibly bewitching amber-haired girl along with a handsome blond youth.\nHearing Austin's question Venessa sighed slightly as she knew Austin was aware of what she asked. But since he tried to play it safe, she wouldn't remain in her shell anymore.\n\"I mean the current you. The Austin who the world is looking upon now. The Austin who fights bravely in his battles, and instead of words, who shows the might he holds in his arms. The Austin who had spoken so gentlemanly these days with me and the one who has shown such considerable behavior. Were you always like this, Austin?\"\nAustin was genuinely a little taken aback by so many heavy words all of a sudden. He did have a hunch about what Venessa tried to ask with her prior question, but still, she had so many things in store...\nNot to talk about, Venessa's lack of conversation skills was the prominent feature that made her most popular after Luna in the manga Austin read in her previous life. Her being so talkative was startling in itself.\nCollecting his thoughts, he replied after a long pause.\n\"Why are you interested in knowing it?\"\nThere was no obligation for Austin to answer her, but when they were having a normal conversation with no way of him running around, it's better he prolonge it until the main event doesn't commence.\n\"Well, you don't have to answer if you don't want, but I want to know whether the way I behaved with you, the curse I voiced, and the behavior I showed. I want to know whether I was doing such things with the current Austin?\"\n\"And will that make you guilty?\"\nAustin's answer came so sudden that Venessa became slightly startled as it took her time to register his words. But in the end, she has resolved to speak truthfully, and so she did.\n\"You can say that, yes. I will be less burdened if you say that you changed over time; rather, you have been the same ever since. I know I will sound hypocritical, but I do respect who you are now, but your previous self would still repulse me.\"\nVanessa's every word were spoken consciously and after a thorough contemplation.\nAfter what she had seen in the war in the Eden Academy and have heard about Xylex from Sicily, her admiration and respect toward Austin have indeed reached the point where she might not look him in the eyes while talking.\nAustin was aware of Venessa's inner storm of thoughts, but he really didn't want to drag this conversation nor any further relations with her.\n\"Just think I never changed. It will be beneficial for both of us, Venessa. We both don't have anything to do with each other, then why not we live in our own worlds?\"\nHis words were straightforward and slightly rude. If any other boy had stood beside such a gorgeous girl, then these disheartening words would be the last thing they would have said.\nBut Austin wasn't tempted with her beauty nor her interest in him. For him, Venessa was still the same as she was before. Just the intention to gain points from her has vanished.\nVanessa took a long pause as it seemed she was collecting herself after hearing out Austin's words. With her voice slightly heavier, she tried to speak in a serene tone.\n\"Flowery words aren't something I generally prefer but right now, I would have appreciated it if you had just lied to me. Anyway, Austin...\"\nSuddenly with a smile adorning her face, Venessa turned toward him, and so he did before she extended her hand, which Austin took reflexively.\n\"Even though we had a bumpy ride until now, it was nice meeting you.\"\nAustin was unsure why they were shaking hands and why it seemed that Venessa was about to cry, so he just nodded in the end before Venessa left his side.\nAustin's eyes were focused on her, distancing back as without breaking a word with anyone else, even some of them called for her; Venessa left the hall like she had just lost something.\nSuddenly his own image, when Lilia broke the engagement with him, flashed in his memory, and for even a second, he felt he should follow her. But in the end, he didn't.\n'I hope she gets normal by tomorrow. '\nWith a sigh, Austin sipped the remaining fruit beer. Little did he know that tomorrow would bring such shocking news, not to him but to the whole Eden Academy.\n____________________\nA/N: - Am I the only one who felt bad for her?\nAnyway, I am really sorry for the short chapter but adding anything extra would be lighten up the significance to the main scene.

      "content": "\"Ah, grandma, I forgot to tell you something.\"\nUnder a humungous 30 feet, dense tree sat a pair of otherworldly women as one of them caressed the beautiful hair of her granddaughter.\nIt's already been two months since Luna came to meet her grandma, but in the real world, only been two days.\nDuring these two months, Luna trained in those fields in which she was either unaware of or was weak compared to other areas.\nLuna, as usual, got immense in training to the point that she read mana mail of Austin after a day of its arrival. She just loved to train, and when she's at it, she forgets the world.\nFortunately, her grandma was kind enough to remind Luna to reply to the mails so her lover doesn't get worried. Coming out of her battle freak temperament, Luna regretted a lot and sent him a lot of love in apology.\nTo her, Austin is her foremost priority, but whenever she dwells in insane battles, she just loses focus from reality and gets lost in the chaos.\nCurrently, after a thorough yet small training session, the duo sat leisurely under the tree when Luna suddenly remembered something she had to tell.\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"Actually, when I was threatening the Xylex's emperor...umm...I forgot his name. So when I was giving him the ultimatum, suddenly, a voice reached up to me.\"\nThe older one didn't interrupt her granddaughter even though she realized whom Luna was going to refer to. With a hum, she asked Luna to continue.\n\"That voice was creepy and carried a very intense mana presence, even if it was just a voice. That voice referred to me as Celeria's descended and told me it would come after me whatever it takes. I wonder why it called me such? \"\nLuna knew what she was saying so causally was a matter to concern about. The name which was attached to Luna by that voice wasn't just any name.\nBut Luna wanted to ask her grandma to tell herself about it rather than her asking it directly.\nAfter a short pause, the older woman spoke in her naturally soothing tone while running her slim and pale finger across the platinum falls.\n\"Are you aware of the seven deities who protect the seven divisions of lands?\"\nLuna, without thinking much, nodded.\nIt was an elementary grade knowledge that every continent has its Guardian Beast protecting the piece of land they have voluntarily formed millions of years ago.\nThe mythical beast who has taken charge to look over Gram is the strongest of the seven, or to say, he is the only being who can even rival a God.\nGram's backing isn't just the hero or the resources which the ancients have left. The Guardian Deity doesn't appear so normally, but if a catastrophe-level threat befalls Gram, the world knows what being would arise.\n\"The voice you heard belongs to one of them and a very idiot one at that.\"\n\"Well, I figured that much from its words but Grandma, why did it mention the Guardian of the North-Eastern continent, Eleanor?\"\nLuna had complete knowledge of what she had just asked, but since her grandma had opted to hide this fact until now, Luna would let her do the honors instead.\nHer Grandma was very well aware of her beloved's tease, but she also thought it was best for her to take the lead now.\n\"I know it's late when we have spent so much time together already, but Luna, I am the guardian deity of Eleanor, Celeria Eleanor. And the reason you were called my descended is simple. You carry the mana I have imbued inside you slowly through the training. And don't worry about that lecherous deity; I will make him pay in the most vital times.\"\nThe glint in Celeria's eyes was dangerous enough to make Luna wonder what kind of divine punishment would be bestowed upon that specific being.\nBut in the end she didn't care since her goal in Xylex was just to make her darling's reach wider. She knew she wasn't on the level to rival a Guardian until now, but until her grandma was on her back and Austin by her side, she could face any danger in the world.\n'Gosh! I miss him so much! '\n_______________________\nBack in Eden Academy, the talk about the honorary ceremony was in full blow since there were students involved in it, and also the rumors about Austin being spotted with the First Princess.\nThe second topic was majorly gossiped about since Austin had been secretly gaining a lot of followers along with more haters.\nBeing paired with the idol Saintess wasn't enough, and now he was also hagging the princess, and rumors were that, an incredibly hot black-haired woman had been secretly dating him.\nMany people have been planning to get proof of Austin being with other women and showing it to their goddess(Luna)and set her free from the Wolf's(Austin) claws.\nAmidst the hot gossip, a piece of certain news broke out that the famous warrior of Eden Academy who left the ceremonial hall yesterday, even without receiving the honor, has dropped out of Academy.\nSomeone said, that this morning Venessa was seen in the principal office before she left the school premise without any expedition given.\nShe was also not seen dining around breakfast or lunch. Her seat was empty during classes, and most of all, she was absent from practical training too.\nIt was more than enough to flare up the rumors of Venessa leaving the school, but the point was, why?\nWhy did such a brilliant warrior who fought so well in the war and had a bright future ahead with the path she was walking upon suddenly leave the school?\n\"Kyou-kun, has Venessa really left the academy? I didn't find her at the dorms.\"\nDuring the tea time, two girls of similar age entered inside the meeting room, which Kyouki and his party members shared.\nAs Sicily came inside, she asked Kyouki in a slightly hurried tone since, just like Lilia, Sicily was extremely worried about Venessa's whereabouts.\nKyouki was sitting on the meeting table with his gaze fixed on the drowning sun, as wordlessly he extended a paper toward the duo.\nPerplexedly, Sicily took the paper as she along with Lilia, started reading the content.\n[Hello guy, I hope you all doing good. Umm..you must have found that I have left the Academy this morning. Sorry, for not meeting you all before leaving, but I knew I wouldn't have taken this step if I had met any of you. Don't worry; I am not going like for forever but for some months or maybe years, who knows. The reason I am disappearing so suddenly is to either become strong enough so I can face myself in the mirror or get eaten by some strange beast, hahaha. Anyway, I wrote a lot already, so goodbye for now. I hope we meet again sooner than later. See ya~.\"\n\"K-Kyouki-kun...this? \"\nSicily's eyes were damp as she read until the very end, and Lilia was no better. Both of them had tears blurring their vision as they looked toward Kyouki in the hope of finding some answers.\nKyouki sighed before he got up from the table, and after leaning his back against the wall, he spoke in a neutral tone.\n\"Vanessa has taken this step to prove, not us or anyone but only a single person, that she is worthy to stay by his side. \"\n\"Don't tell me... \"\nSicily's eyes were wide as she covered her mouth with the other hand. Disbelief, blended with shock, covered her expression.\nLilia's eyes fell slowly to the ground as she also realized who was the person for whom Venessa had taken this challenging path, as a sense of admiration and awe erupted inside her.\n\"Vanessa has taken the step for someone else, but isn't it okay? At least she is trying, but I am just playing around. \"\nSicily got out of her stupor, but there was no way for her to calm Kyouki now since he had been frustrated about this matter for very long.\nRather she chose to take another approach this time...\n\"Kyou-kun, even though we are only three now, let's do our best and become the strongest. \"\nLilia also stepped forward to encourage Kyouki.\n\"I agree, Kyouki-kun. Let's do our best together. I know Venessa-san would also want us to become strong so the next time we meet, we can walk shoulder to shoulder with her. \"\nSeeing his partners being so considerate toward him, a smile broke out on Kyouki's face as, after a slight pause, he also spoke in a spirited tone.\n\"Okay then, let's do our best and show this world what's the real might of Hero's Party.\"\n____________________\nA/N: - It really pains to write cliché dialogues. Anyway, I will write Venessa's monologue before the time she came to this decision, in a separate side chapter.\nDrop a comment if you are hyped~",

      "content": "Austin Wright.\nA name that has been in my mind, willingly or not, since the first day I entered the prestigious Eden's Academy.\nI had a lot of dreams, a lot to pursue, and the Academy would have been the first step toward the greater future I envisioned. So I decided to spend my three years in the best way possible by learning many things and making reliable connections.\nBut just on the first day, I saw a haughty and arrogant noble behaving like a scumbag and talking vulgarly to his fiancee.\nI wanted to get over there and beat him to a pulp since I hate those people who boast about their background, but in actuality, they are nothing but gutless weaklings.\nFortunately, there was a young student just like me who took charge and punched the blond noble right in the face.\nI was satisfied with such results since I carry the same emotion as the man who became my friend real soon after orientation.\nNot only Kyouki-san but the scumbag's fiancee and also my old friend Sicily joined the team.\nThere was also a girl in our group who mingled in the group affairs the least, but she was a good person, so we got along somehow.\nEverything was going fine. Our party was training together, developing together, and before I knew it, I was already falling for the person who was bestowed with the blessing to become a hero.\nPrimarily, I only looked at Kyouki-san as a rival since his, and my fighting style was very similar, but soon, my rivalry took the direction of what one pronounces as love.\nBut my maiden feelings didn't become an obstacle in my training, and as things were going, I would have become the person I once dreamt of. Someone my papa could feel proud of and someone who could walk beside the hero.\nBut my life took a massive turn during the first expedition the school sent us to.\nIt was a massive event since we had a goal to turn Luna back to what she actually was before she suddenly got intrigued in Austin.\nBut one thing led to another, and we suddenly saw the rise of a Terror Rank demon in the jungle, which for the first time made me realize how it felt to be helpless.\nUnexpectedly it wasn't our party who handled such catastrophe, but the person whom I only regarded as trash and coward until now.\nThat was one heck of a day of my life when I repulsively took some heavy shit decisions, and in the end, I had to apologize to Austin for blaming him for something he never did.\nIt turned out that Luna wasn't cursed either, and Austin's sudden change in temperament was because of the relationship they had built-in, so less time.\nKyouki-san was depressed, but in the end, he couldn't turn someone's feelings for him. I, Sicily, and Lilia had complicated feelings about such development, but there was one thing I realized from the expedition event.\nAustin isn't the same as he pretended to be.\nHe wasn't weak or gutless as I always thought since even standing in front of Terror Demon takes a lifetime of courage, yet not only did he stand before that creature, he also defeated it single-handedly.\nAfter that day, my perception of Austin changed from hatred to curiosity.\nSlowly I realized how differently he could behave when Luna was around. Like he was a totally different person. I doubt whether even Kyouki-san could treat someone like Austin gentlemanly behaved toward Luna.\nAnd not that he also ceased the vulgar acts he used to perform.\nAustin was a changed man.\nSoon, the Northern Empire incident took place when my anger toward Austin started igniting again, but the gap between Austin and me at that time made me realize that it doesn't matter what I think anymore.\nHe was getting far as I only moved at a slow pace.\nMaybe in the consciousness of chaos, my rivalry shifted toward Austin since he was able to nearly defeat the person I thought was the strongest in the world. My papa.\nOne thing led to other, and I was getting more and more eager to know about Austin.\nI still have my heart for Kyouki-san, undoubtedly, but for Austin, I was getting immense in him even without letting him know.\nThe war which happened in the Eden Academy and the way Austin saved me, triggered something inside my mind, and since that day, I came to know that I was lying to myself.\nI never loved Kyouki-san, actually. I just adored and respected him since he came from a small town and rose to such a position.\nSo was I in love with Austin?\nI didn't know, and I didn't want to find either.\nJust my feelings were getting entangled day after day as I thought of him. Maybe I was a greedy bitch who loved only strong men, but sometimes I felt that if Austin had stayed weak with his current personality, then I might have been stayed by his side and protected him?\nWell, I knew thinking such things were fruitless now.\nAustin had such an otherworldly Luna, and he clearly told me I wasn't his type of woman. Heck, I felt whether he even saw me as a woman or not.\nI had made plans that if not by his side, then at least I could be any help to him in the future, and while staying in Eden's Academy, I couldn't grow to such length.\nI had to take a more significant step.\nBut for the last time, I wanted to meet the person who had made my mind a mess for a long time now.\nIf someone's appearance have made me baffled to the point where I felt the world disappearing around me then it was also because of the same unfair guy.\nAustin was looking extremely dashing in the ceremonial hall, almost like he was making it difficult for me to leave.\nEven though I put on the make-up for the first time and wore such a revealing dress, Austin didn't look at me for more than a blink.\nWell, I was expecting this since someone beautiful as Luna and charming as the woman who called his big brother was fawning over him. In comparison to them, I felt my scars and stiff muscles a little embarrassing, but it's not like I would attract Austin even if I looked a little more womanly.\nHe might hate someone like me.\nI didn't want to have a depressing talk with him since I was leaving the academy already, but in the end, I couldn't hold myself and asked what had been weighing on my mind for a very long.\nI was interpreting my words like I was trying to uplift my guilt by knowing whether Austin was the same as ever, but I never imagined that Austin would conclude this talk in such a way.\n\"Just think I never changed. It will be beneficial for both of us, Venessa. We both don't have anything to do with each other, then why not we live in our own worlds?\"\nI realized what kind of fool I was to muddle in a world where I never belonged to.\nHow selfish and ugly a personality I have to approach the person whom I have shamed so much.\nWhy did I say such a thing and put Austin in that place where he had to remind me, we don't belong to each other.\nHe was different from me.\nHe didn't need me...\nI am nothing to him...\nI knew it but hearing for him...\n....it hurts a lot.\nMy feet were moving out of the hall with my mind blank like I had lost something today.\nSomeone like me...was dreaming to....\nI can't even laugh at myself, but at least Austin made me realize where I stand.\nI did feel hopeless for some time after coming out of the palace. I even cried after such a long time, yet I never lost hope that I couldn't bounce back.\nI am a warrior, and a warrior knows the best how to stand back after being forced to the ground.\nI know I was acting selfish again by leaving my friends and family behind, but if I don't take this step then, I might never be able to see myself in the mirror.\nStubbornness?\nYes, I was being stubborn that one day.... at least for even a second, I will make Austin proud of me and get the look that I have only seen directed toward someone else.\nMaybe, it will all go in vain, and I might lose something precious in the process of my journey, but who cares.\nWarriors are famous for being muscle-head, and I am taking advantage of being such.\n'Wait for me, Austin. I will become worthy of being with you. '\n__________________\nA/N: - I don't know if you guys liked the chapter since it carried no development toward the plot, but I felt Venessa's thoughts must be displayed since she has a vital role in the story.\nYou might see Venessa being contradictory in this chapter, but that's how I wanted to portray her thought process.\n(This slightly unedited so sorry about that ?)\nWell, drop a comment~",

      "content": "[Ding!]\nHearing the loud ringing voice inside his head, Austin's consciousness slowly started to wake as he frowned slightly before lifting his back with his eyes still closed.\nUnlike the gentlemanly looks he adorned in the ceremony or the aloof Austin everyone sees in the Academy; the current him can make many girls fawn over his child-like appearance.\nUnlike the other noble kids, Austin didn't like to wear robes and cardigans while sleeping, so he put on the tailor-made pajama, and coupled with the slightly swollen face he had now, Austin seemed truly like an adorable child.\nThe notification from the system had halted since the time Austin fulfilled the weekly requirement by reuniting with Saya before the system went under development break.\nHearing the mechanical ring once again after what felt so long, Austin didn't help to hold his curiosity as, while rubbing his eyes, he called the system in a grumpy voice.\n[Ding!]\n[Villain's System 2.0]\n[New features: -\n1. Quest tracker\n2. Level evaluation\n3. Emergency Retreat]\n[Status: -\nName:- Austin\nLevel: - 48\nAge:- 15\nRace:- Human\nHP :- 2800\nMP:- 5500\nStr:- 1350\nSpd:- 1250\nStm:- 1000\nAttributes:- Flames(99)\nWind (83)\nAqua (64)\nEarth (78)\nSpirits(22)\nXXXX (0)\nSkills:- Infernous Conjuror (A)\nGravity Manipulation (A)\nSilent Steps (B)\nSprint (A)\nPain Infliction (S)\nTongue of Spirit(SS)\nDark Escape (B)\nSilent Mind (A)\nIndefinite Leap (A)\nChaos of Destruction (SSS)\nStats Points:- 845]\nAustin stared at the screen for a long time and realized that his stats had grown even though he didn't utilize Villain's point in it.\nWell, it was understandable since Status Points doesn't just grow when Austin uses points at them; instead, it also tracks the development of Austin goes through real-time.\nThe surplus of available stats points must be because of the completion of last week's requirement. Well, Austin never thought that the weekly tenure system would vanish along with the surveillance tab as soon Austin's wish to heal Saya gets fulfilled.\nBut since the current Saya was in front of his eyes, he could rest assured about the sister who still was in the hospital bed.\n'New feature, eh....'\nThe first two functions were self-explanatory, and Austin felt it would be bothersome to learn about them, so he opted for the strange option, which felt like a skill by name yet was posted as the system's function.\n[Emergency Retreat: - A function that allows the host to leap back in time to some certain extent by utilizing a minimum of 500 Villain's Points and fulfilling a requirement that the System would release. TnC applied.]\nAustin's heart grew a little heavy as his sluggishness exhausted in a second.\n'Time travel....is it even possible? '\nAustin didn't want to pretend he didn't believe in leaping through time which was impossible for any current-day magic to attain.\nThe System was real so did the skills and power boost Austin have received from it. Not wanting to trust the newly added feature was nothing but a futile try to ignore the serious death flag that has been raised right now.\nFive hundred Villain's Point was something he could keep if really something that dire situation arose, but the problem was the second requirement.\n'It won't ask me to help the elder cross the road, right? '\nA dry smile formed on Austin's lips as he also realized that it wasn't a child's play to deal with the devil.\nIt was Villain's System, and so would be the tasks given accordingly.\nHe was required to perform a task that could change the plot, but the highest bump was Austin's change of approach. With Luna's help, Austin could change the story without gaining hatred more than he already had.\nWho liked to be scorned all the time?\nBut Austin felt that the System didn't like such a loophole. That's why it suddenly took the evolution and ceased the weekly requirement plan and placed something which naturally would make him do something audacious.\nBut in a way, it was beneficial for Austin, too, since he found a chance where he could reverse back the damage he might regret losing through the new feature.\nHe didn't like to be hated, but it didn't mean he would do anything out of his way to avoid it.\nIf worst comes to worst, he will go to any length if the situation become severe. Until he has Luna by his side, he doesn't fear being targeted by the world.\n'That reminds me... '\nAustin looked around the room and found a small brown envelope resting on the drawer case, besides his bed.\nA smile bloomed on his face erasing all kinds of discomfort he felt after reading the content on the system screen, as he gently unwrapped the paper and saw the words written inside.\nAs soon he read the small phrase, which was not even a complete proper sentence, his heart became warm.\n[Luna's coming back♡ Darling should prepare his heart since I am going to pounce on him real soon♡♡~]\nStrangely Luna becomes bold in her letters, but in person, she still shies away like a pure maiden who has newly discovered the fruit of love.\n'Well, she's the best either way... '\n____________________\nIn a not-so-distant place could be seen a maid in her early thirties walking through the hallway of the Gram palace as she held a cloth basket in her hand.\nThe way other maids and servants greeted her along the way signified the post she carries as the handsmaid of the first princess.\n(A/N: - Handsmaid = Personal maid)\nThe maid didn't have to walk more than fifty meters before she reached somewhere in the corner of the palace as she entered inside a big room.\nThe room was dyed in white all around with a big square pool built in the middle of the room where stood another maid as she washed some clothes in the pool.\nThis was the laundry of the Gram Palace, where the clothes and other textiles were washed by some specially appointed maids.\nThe maid who entered inside walked toward the woman who also got up after seeing the handmaid of the first princess.\n\"Another one? These ceremonies makes me tired.\"\nThe laundry woman grumbled as she took the white bed sheet from the basket before spreading casually.\nSuddenly her eyes went wide as she saw a wet mark printed on the sheet, which definitely wasn't because of water or anything but...\n\"A-Aina-san? Has the first princess already found a partner without even getting married?\"\nThe maid had a clear idea of what this wet mark was since she herself was a young adult who had recently married and had come to realize what this musky smell and sticky substance actually was.\nHearing the laundry woman, the handsmaid\nAina, sneered as she spoke in a confident tone.\n\"Do you think anyone has the capability to slip inside my lady's bed just like that?\"\n\"Then these marks?\"\nAs the laundry woman asked, Aina, glanced at her surroundings and affirmed that no one was around before she grew closer to the woman in front as she whispered in a low tone.\n\"Since you are my friend, I will tell you this, but dare to leak a word, and you are dead. \"\nThe other party nodded with stars in her eyes as, being a woman, she naturally loved to gossip, especially regarding these matters.\n\"Young lady Tiara was spotted at the ceremony hall being escorted by ex-Noble, Austin, Count Vincent's son and also the person who received the bravery honor recently. From what I saw, after leaving sir Austin's side, the princess ran back to her room and prohibited anyone, including me, too, from entering inside. Naturally, I couldn't leave her like this, so I was standing in front of the door all night when I heard it...\"\nThe sheet was wrinkled in the listener's clutch as she urged Aina to speak further.\n\"What you heard?\"\nAina blushed slightly but after a brief pause she let go of the hesitation.\n\"Sh-She was moaning and begging Sir Austin, who undoubtedly was only in her imagination, while she did such things which have results in your hands. I don't know whether Young Lady Tiara is in love with Master Austin, but she is kind of extremely obsessed with him.\"\n__________________\nA/N: - Drop a comment~",

      "content": "\"See. You can do it too, if you just take it slow.\"\n\"Sorry, Onii-sama, for troubling you like this.\"\nCurrently, Austin was in Luna's room, training his sister on how to live normally without breaking things around her.\nSaya's physical might was undoubtedly greater than Austin's. However, since she never got the time to orient adjustment of her physicality to her surrounding, she often broke various things like the doorknobs, stationery, and other small items.\nAustin very well understood how it feels to control their own strength at such trivial things, but fortunately, he had his limiters which allowed him to move freely, unlike his sister, who didn't have a system.\nSo apart from tutoring her, there weren't many options.\n\"It's okay, Saya. Don't rush it, and take your time.\"\nAustin patted the sulky Saya when suddenly he received notification over his system.\n[Ding!]\n[New Quest!]\n[Degree: - Red!]\n[Objective: - Save Sicily Reynolds]\n[Time left: - 59 min 36 sec]\n[Reward: - 100 Villain's Point]\n[Penalty: - None]\n'Huh? Sicily? '\nIt was the first time Austin received a quest from the system and was already thrown into a dilemma. Austin knew that the system mustn't be joking with him, but the problem was, why so suddenly? And what's with the penalty panel?\nBut since there wasn't much time left to complete the deed, Austin put his legs to work and left the contemplation for later.\n\"Saya, continue your training. I will be back.\"\n\"Ehh? Onii-sama?\"\nAustin didn't take Saya together since he wasn't sure about the situation. Despite knowing that his sister was more substantial than him, his brotherly instincts got better of him.\nHe knew that inside the school, there was no one other than headmaster Merlin who could push Sicily to the edge, especially when she had the staff he gave her. So he initiated his search from the outside.\nLeaving the school premise just after exiting the dorm, Austin circulated his mana and tried to search in the forest situated on the Northern side of Eden Academy.\nOne has to remember that Austin doesn't have mana detection like Luna, where he could search over kilometers in one go. His range of detection was only limited to a hundred meters.\nMana detection doesn't depend on the skill or mana reserve; instead, it's a basic skill that runs on one's experience.\n'I wonder... '\nThe time was passing rather briskly, but Austin didn't find a single trace of Sicily nor any of her party members. And since he didn't know whom he could ask in Eden's Academy, Austin's labor was the only option left.\nAustin wouldn't have bothered much if not for someone he knew and was acquainted with; after all, he wasn't a hero of justice.\n'At least give me the location, you damn system! '\nAustin shouted in frustration but little did he expect that the system would hear his voice and respond such kindly.\n[Ding!]\n[Map feature Unlocked!]\n[Click to locate Quest's Objective:]\nAustin's eyes went slightly wide as he halted mid-air and saw the abrupt notification popping in front of his retina.\nIt was like the system was just complying with his request and releasing new features accordingly. Well, he wouldn't complain since time was already running short.\nOpting for the tab with a grin blimp, Austin was met with a vast square illusionary sheet that contained the map of the whole territory of Eden Academy, including all the jungles, lairs, and nearby markets.\nBut Austin didn't intend to check them out since his mind went slightly numb as he saw the place where the red dot, signifying Sicily's position, was located.\n'Eden's Academy... But how Sicily... don't tell me she went into the labyrinth!'\nSuddenly a cold chill passed down Austin's back as a thought emerged in his mind that most likely would be the reason for Sicily's life-threatening situation.\nAustin closed the map in a little hurry before he darted toward the school at full speed.\nThe labyrinth which made Austin so flustered wasn't like any other lair or monster nest that most of the populace is aware of.\nThe labyrinth situated beneath Eden's Academy is a terrifying place, to the point that even in the manga which Austin read in his previous life, the abyss-like place wasn't cleared by Kyouki.\nThe monsters roaming inside the labyrinth were mentioned to be so strange that even the hero, in his full potential, wasn't daring to step in because of the absurdity it contained.\nIt was weird why the author and mangaka put such a thing in the story when the hero wasn't going to clear it until the end, but it's the same reason it made the labyrinth so mysterious.\nEven a single chapter was drawn on the labyrinth where Luna and Kyouki tried to venture independently; Austin realized what difficulty the Labyrinth had in store.\nThe reason he never tried to train inside the labyrinth before today was headmaster Merlin.\nHe wasn't just a headmaster but also a gatekeeper of the labyrinth, which was engraved under the Academy even before the fort was built.\nNow why the headmaster would allow a mere student to enter the abyss when he himself doesn't dare to go inside was something Austin didn't care about since he didn't have time.\nLooking at the watch on the system, he has already used up his twenty minutes due to moving to and fro.\nHe reached the fort and didn't bother by the monitoring unit, which was warning him for flying at such speed as he landed on the peak of the castle-like academy.\nResting his feet on the ledge of the topmost window, Austin observed the glass, which was restrained with dozens of mana spells.\n'Well, it's the headmaster's office after all.... '\nAustin removed the limiter from his strength, and after applying his fist with amber shade infernos, he pulled his arm before punching it down on the frame.\n**TING**\nA bell ringing sound came as the glass, along with the spells, was broken instantly and also gave quite a heavy backlash to Austin's right arm.\nHis muscles went numb for a second before he took out a potion from the inventory and gulped it down.\nThe glass, indeed, was conjured with a high-degree spell. Even applying all of his strength and utilizing mana as a backup, Austin felt a heavy impact like he just had punched an enormous mountain with his fist.\nAustin already confirmed that Headmaster wasn't inside his office since his peculiar mana signature never came into Austin's detection. Instead, Austin, while breaking the windows, felt something ominous coming from inside.\nAnd after jumping inside the office, his premonition became a reality as he stared at the vast black hole dug in the middle of the room.\nMassaging his brows, Austin muttered in a grumpy tone before jumping inside.\n\"This is going to be hectic.\"\n_________________________\nA/N: - The story isn't progressing too fast, right, I am trying to detail as thoroughly as I can, but if you guys want, I can write more leisure chapters in between arcs?\nLemme know",

      "content": "The Abyss.\nA labyrinth named after the realm of darkness since it is the only labyrinth that still was not completely discovered yet or, to say, not even 10% was explored until now.\nThere was a reason why even such legendary warriors like Charles Sinten, Alex Nuèye, and also the great sage Merlin were available as a pioneer; the high echelon of Gram didn't allow them to venture the darkness.\nThere is strange energy inside the labyrinth that oppresses any kind of mana; even if the energy isn't released out, the peculiar sensation weakens anyone who carries magical energy inside them.\nNaturally, no typical human could be pushed off the edge to let them inspect the Abyss and find what was inside. Not to talk about the first creature which Headmaster Merlin encountered made it clear how dangerous this darkness carried.\nFrom that day onwards, the Labyrinth was ordered to be sealed away, and not only that. The Eden Academy's foundation was also built over it so the strongest mage of the continent could always watch over it.\nIn a way, it was putting the lives of students in danger, but if the creatures inside the Labyrinth really get out, then there was a high chance that everyone inside the territory of Gram might cease to exist, or maybe the whole plain?\nNo one knows the depth of the Abyss, but if the first floor carried such a terrifying being that could make Master Merlin's frightened to death, it was uncertain what catastrophe it stored in its deepest layer.\nThe seal which was applied over it was undoubtedly of the highest grade with seven Unique Grade and one Legendary Grade Artifact provided as the security lock over it.\nExcept for master Merlin, there would be very few mages in the whole world who could operate the seal without getting noticed.\nBut in front of Austin that near to impossible task has been accomplished.\nSicily was inside the Labyrinth, which means she defied the seals somehow and entered at a time when Merlin wasn't around.....\n__..__\nThe topmost office of Eden's Academy was built in a way that its underneath would lead directly into the labyrinth.\nBasic architecture skills.\nAfter jumping inside the wormhole, Austin descended at a steady pace for more than ten seconds without any kind of intent or unnatural presence on the radar.\nBut after some blinks, he started feeling severely uncomfortable, like his insides were twisting and something was getting numb passing each second.\nDespite his face covered in sweat, Austin didn't panic as he finally landed on the tough ground before taking out the little Lamp, which actually was an artifact from his inventory.\nThe small flame was enough to ignite a decent area around Austin as he commanded the system in a slightly hoarse tone.\n\"*Huff* Limit my *Hah* MP to 100\".\nThe action was taken in a blink before the heavyweight over Austin got lifted like it never was there in the first place.\n'So it really worked, huh... '\nAustin gave himself time to settle down before he held the lamp high to his face level before walking forward.\nThe reason why after limiting his mana, Austin was able to breathe freely was simple.\nThis place was the nemesis of mana that Austin came to realize from the manga. The heavier amount of mana one carries, the greater this labyrinth would affect them.\nIn the story, Luna was more influenced than Kyouki since she has the most condensed form of mana running through her veins. As this also became a reason why Kyouki didn't dare to move forward since he didn't want to hurt Luna by any means.\n'Somehow, I am feeling a little pissed now....'\nAustin resorted to not remembering the manga anymore for 'various reasons.'\nFastening his pace, he saw less than thirty-five minutes were remaining now as he tried to widen his senses and observe the surrounding.\nThe red blimp, which was showing Sicily's location, has fixated on the place where Austin was. It didn't show a precise location, but it was fine since he already got the gist of where she could be.\n\"Hmm?\"\nSuddenly his ears perked with the slow sound of something sliding along the dusty ground. The sound was minimal, but he could discern that it was about ten meters away from him.\nHe halted his steps since he knew there wasn't any point in going anywhere to find the monster which was seen on the first floor as he sensed himself being surrounded slowly but surely.\nHe didn't dart away since he knew it would mean nothing until he doesn't utilize mana and levitate from his spot.\nUsing a simple command, Austin applied a single ounce of mana inside the lamp before the flame danced merrily as it left the steel cage and ascended in the sky for 50 meters before lightning up the vicinity like a mini-sun.\n[KHEEEEEEK!!]\nA pair of dull golden eyes, which had slit pupils positioned in its center, intently stared at Austin as the latter finally realized what he was facing.\nOn a rough scale, the creature was almost 9 meters in total length from its head to the end of its tail.\nBlack scales, which looked unscratchable with regular blades, spread all over its body, and a slick tongue whipped the air every now and then.\n[Another mortal dared to step into my domain! Are you tired of living human?!]\nAustin's ear lobes shined as the translating artifact activated instantly and helped him understand the monster's tongue.\n\"So you can talk, huh? Well, I'm not here to play. Return the girl, and I will go back silently.\"\nAny being other than a human could only talk after reaching a particular stage of their life. Like the demons get their vocals when they arrive at least Terror Rank or higher.\nBut the problem was that the being in front wasn't a demon since no curse energy was involved. And a natural monster ascending to that level was seldom heard.\nSuddenly the air surrounding the blond youth because heavier as he felt the chills that oozed with life-threatening danger, but when he had come this far...\n[That Green Apple which I ate? That stubborn brat is still in the process of getting digested, so why not you help me push her inside and also get dissolved along with her?]\nAustin felt like the monster was talking a lot, and he didn't have much time left, so he took the initiative to abandon the chattering.\nThe ground beneath Austin's feet crumbled slightly as he gathered strength in his feet before jumping at a furious speed toward the gigantic serpent.\n[Huh?]\nThe creature could only sense something approaching at a furious pace before it ducked its head to avoid whatever it was.\n**DHAKKK**\nThe wall just behind the place where the snake's head was a blink ago broke brutally before big chunks of rock started falling on its body.\nWith disbelief shrouding its reasoning, the reptile looked at the place and found the human was the source of such a destructive blow.\n[Y-You.....how can someone...without mana....]\nThe monster fell into a stupor since the mana in the human was lower than the average, yet it had such colossal strength!\n\"Am I getting sloppy? Well, you aren't just any snake after all.\"\nHearing the boy's daring words, the serpent queen got enraged as she let go of all the hesitation before charging up her mouth with the attack she planned to direct next.\n[Blame your luck, kid...]\n**HISSSSSSS**\nA purple smog erupted from the creature's tubular long one, meter fangs before covering the whole vicinity and entirely covering the illumination that the dancing amber was spreading.\n'[Now what would you do, human? This smoke is nothing you can escape, even if you have that strength. Neither do you have the mana to get rid of it.]'\nThe creature moved silently along the ground with its senses wholly focused on the frail human standing in oblivion.\n'[Now you are mine!] '\nBut before the queen could have lunged on her prey, a pecuilar whisper reached her senses and made her freeze in extreme dread.\n[XXXX-XXXXXXX-XXX]\n________________________\nA/N: - Drop a comment~",

      "content": "Spiritual Magic.\nA magic that primarily isn't oriented from the users' core; instead, they become the channel of the strange energy which originates from thin air.\nIt's mentioned thin air for those who don't have a spiritual tongue. Not to talk about that, having the talent to bend and utilize the spirits is extremely rare, to the point where an entity in every hundred years is born with such skill.\nAs generations passed, the existence of the Spiritual Tongue became a myth since no promising generation showed signs of being in a friendly relationship with the small things revolving around the planet.\nPrimary functioning of spirit-based attacks.\nSpirits are being who get along pretty well with anyone who keeps their company and acknowledges their presence. There are some certain egos of some specific spirits, too, like the Space and Time spirits are the rarest of the rarest to get in contact with.\nIt's said that whoever gets surrounded by all six types of spirit would become the first Spirit Monarch of history and capture the world in his fist.\n...\nBack to the present.\nThe serpent queen wasn't a newly born monster but far from it. She was an existence who roamed the outside world since ancient times and fed herself every hundred years.\nNaturally, she has seen various kinds of beings and also has fought against them.\nBut having the ability to oppress mana gave her superiority over those who tried to stand against her and not to mention her own might, which was not less than those demons.\nHowever, what made her feel the sensation of being scared for the first time in life was a spiritual user which she met around five hundred years ago.\nThat was the first time she came to know that there was still something she couldn't go against, so after thinking wisely, she took a strategical retreat but killed the human once she found the chance at his most vulnerable time.\nFrom that day, she found the spiritual users and killed them to cease the existence of all those who could pose a danger to her and like others from her birthplace.\nBut suddenly, a puny human who had mana not even in comparison to those warriors who came here before, willingly, started whispering in the same tongue which had given the chills of life to her before too.\n[This can't be happening! Stop mumbling, you insane human!!]\nThe enraged serpent queen lashed at Austin, which the latter dodged quite easily as he gathered wind spirits around him before generating a heavy whirlpool on the center of his palm.\nUnder the shocking gaze of the creature, which saw such proficient use of spiritual energy, Austin threw the wind pool as it started sucking the poisonous gas from the surrounding.\n**WOOOOOOOSH**\nThe gust was heavy enough to push the humungous demon to a corner and also made it difficult for Austin to keep his feet steady at his point.\n[Ding!]\n[Quest Update!]\n[Degree: - Red!]\n[Objective: - Save Sicily Reynolds]\n[Time left: - 26 min 36 sec-> 3 min 12 sec]\n[Reward: - 100 Villain's Point]\n[Penalty: - None]\nAustin's retina contracted as he saw how the remaining time decreased absurdly before he turned his head toward the creature and realized what had just happened.\n'Due to the crash, Sicily must have suffered.'\nGritting his teeth, Austin waited for his vision to get cleared before he decided that it was better to end it here before his first quest fails.\n'Well, let's go with the challenging route. '\nBringing out a slim object of one and a half meters in length, which by appearance looked like a traditional sheath, Austin stood while facing the monster.\nBringing the hilt near his waist, Austin extended his left foot and brought his right hand over the handle of the katana. Austin flicked the hilt of the blade with his thumb, releasing the katana slightly out of its cover.\nWith his eyes fixated on the snake in front, Austin felt the incredible sensation from the blade he had used only once before.\nOn the other side, the serpent queen collected herself from the hurricane as she felt the chilly sensation from the human who suddenly summoned a blade from thin air.\n[Is spiritual energy allows him that too!]\nThe queen had no good feeling coming from the blade, which seemed to be charging up with a lethal attack as she immediately attacked Austin first.\n**KHEEK**\nA mouthful of venom was spat out by the serpent toward Austin, which the latter received without any problem since his body wasn't that sensitive to be affected so easily.\n**KHEEK**\n**KHEEK**\nThe reptilian queen continued spitting the dark purple tar in the hope of melting the human under it, and she would have succeeded if she had done it continuously for one day, but Austin didn't have that much time to play around.\nAfter supplying his mana, bit by bit, he finally took out the katana from the sheath and slashed it in a horizontal cut before putting it back on the cover.\n\"Tachi no shokei.\"\nThe slash came at such a violent pace toward the creature that she was only able to see a blue illumination passing through her throat.\nWait, pass thro...\n**KACHAK**\nWith a flesh-splitting sound, the massive head of the serpent separated from her body before it fell to the ground, along with her lifeless rest of the self.\nAustin heaved in relief since he wasn't sure whether he could do it perfectly, even though he didn't have the full mana he had for the first time. But all went well as he kept the katana back in inventory.\n\"Fuck! It's only a minute!\"\nAustin ran toward the massive body, which was devoid of vigor now, before he used his sheer strength to split the snake skin in two as he proceeded in a rush.\nIt didn't take him time to finally find the magic staff that Sicily stubbornly took from him. The staff was standing straight with either end piercing the inside of the serpent muscles.\nThere knelt an olive-haired girl with her eyes numbly closed and no movement in her body; even the open air met her skin after so long.\nAustin hurriedly pulled her out before placing her over his bent knee. As he patted her cheek softly while calling out for her.\n\"Hey, Sicily. Come on, wake up. Hey!\"\nHe called and called, but no response came. Along with the fact that the countdown on the system was still going on, and also the fading impulse he felt from the girl made Austin sure that she was going to die in mere twenty seconds now.\n'Seems there's no way... '\nConcluding that he didn't have many options; Austin took out a small glass container that had a peculiar red fluid inside; Austin gulped half of it.\n'Sorry, Luna.... '\nClosing his eyes, Austin connected his lips to hers before using his tongue as a server and pouring down the content past her throat.\n[Ding!]\n[Congraturaltion]\n....\nAustin wasn't able to check the notification since a life-threatening voice reached up to his senses, making every strand on his body stand straight.\n\"Aus~tin~ Care to explain~.\"\n____________________\nA/N: - Run boy run.\nDrop a comment and let's pray together!",

      "content": "\"Luna, I said I am sorry. There wasn't any option, and if I had delayed even seconds, she would have died.\"\nAustin asked for forgiveness the seventh time after returning to the dorms. Sicily was safe but not to the point where she could regain consciousness, so Austin deposited her in the infirmary and returned to his room, only to see the upset Luna.\nShe wasn't enraged; she was just....silent.\nAnd that made Austin more worried since she wasn't speaking at all. It was fortunate that she didn't disappear and was willing to hear him out. That's why she waited for him in the room.\nBut looking at her, sitting while facing the window without any intention to speak, made Austin's heart clench as he knelt in front of her.\nTaking her hand, which felt extremely cold for some reason, he spoke gently.\n\"At least say something. If you want to get angry with me, then it's okay. It's okay to slap or shout at me, but don't just stay silent, Luna. I want to hear what's going on in your mind.\"\nAustin spoke earnestly since he wanted her to let go of this grief that arose from him. He thought if she yelled at him or cried her emotions out, then he could coax her until she didn't forgive him. But...\nLuna steadily directed her gaze, which carried no peculiar emotion, toward Austin as she voiced her thought in a mild tone.\n\"Imagine our roles are reversed. You are returning from a long trip to see me after such a long time, and when you do see me, I am 'helping' a man in the way you did to Sicily. How would you react?\"\nIt didn't take him to register her word as a syllable leaked out reflexively.\n\"I...\"\nAustin wanted to say something, but when he indeed thought of such a scene where Luna was in such contact with another man, his heart throbbed with a strange sensation building inside of him.\nClenching his fist, he dropped back with his legs folded without any intention to speak any further because he did not know what to say anymore.\nLeaning his face down, Austin saw Luna getting up from the bed as she spoke in the tone which generally used for others but not him.\n\"When you find the answer, then only come to me, Austin.\"\nLuna walked some steps when she felt her hand still being held by Austin, albeit nimbly.\nLuna waited for some more seconds, but Austin didn't move nor spoke any word, which brought a frown on her brows as she finally snatched her hand away and walked out of the room.\nIn the dark room where Austin generally enjoys his private time with Luna, he sat all alone while contemplating various things.\nBut after a long time, what made him feel so nostalgic was the silence and darkness that greeted him.\nHe nearly forgot this sensation, but unlike before, he just couldn't sigh and let it go. This time this loneliness was weighing on him.\nUnlike in the past, when he did not have anyone, he might have lived in such darkness without complaint, but now he had someone he dearly loves. There is someone whom he could not afford to lose. Someone, he cannot think of living apart from.\nRising on his feet after what seemed like a minute, Austin clenched his fist as he cursed himself for not taking this step before.\n'Fuck! What a sore loser I am! \"\n____________\n\"So you failed again? \"\nIn a terrace balcony built inside the Gram palace sat an adorable young lady with shiny blond hair as she sipped on her milk tea.\nThe person she asked the query whose answer she already knew about just bowed his head slightly in shame.\nThe man was in his early twenties with similar hair and eye color as the girl who bit his lips in frustration.\nThe girl who spoke in such a soft tone even though she was pissed more than her brother was none other than the eldest princess Tiara.\n\"First, you failed to get that Red-haired bitch, and now Sicily also slipped out from the labyrinth. What a wasted bastard in the name of brother I have. \"\nTiara's venomous words, along with a gentle smile, made her look terrifying, and looking at the prince's face, it seemed he knew what happens when Tiara gets in the mood.\n\"I-I am sorry, Tia. \"\nSeeing her brother's dejected expression, Tiara sighed as she held his hand after putting the cup on the table.\n\"Brother, you want Luna or not?\"\nHearing the name of the person whom the man has been yearning to hold, he nodded without hesitation.\n\"Unlike Brother Mikhail, you aren't recognized as a competitor to the throne despite being the eldest. Do you know why?\"\nThe firstborn of the Emperor thought for a second before shaking his head in denial.\n\"It's because you don't give you 100% to anything you do. Whether it's showing your worth or erasing some obstacle from the path, you can't seem to strengthen your resolve. \"\nThe blond man registered his sister's words carefully and indeed agreed that there was a single hesitation restricting him from doing his all to gain what he desired.\n\"Listen, brother. If you don't let go of that restraint, then the Luna you always dream about and want to make your own would never look at you. And eventually,y in some years, she would leave this nation. Do you think you can misuse your power in other countries too? Do you think if she leaves you will get together with her? Do you think she would ever love you if that happens? \"\nTiara's eyes were fixated on her brother's profile as she whispered the thoughts she carried and found enough to enrage the sleeping beast inside the first prince.\nAnd she succeeded in her provocation.\nClenching his fist, the man got up and muttered under his breath with determination flaming his eyes and aura being shrouded with a strong resolve.\n\"Nothing can stop me now from making Luna mine. Thanks, Tiara, for pushing me. Now you will see what your brother is capable of. \"\n________________________\nA/N: - They will make up in next chapter and yes the Red-haired B*tch Tiara mentioned is Venessa.\nAnyway, drop a comment if you are hyped for next one~",

      "content": "'What did I do... '\nAfter leaving Austin's dorm, Luna didn't teleport nor use levitation to return since she wanted to think while walking.\nShe couldn't have stayed there, nor could she return to her dorm.\nThe reason she didn't choose to go to her room was simple since Saya was there. If Saya learns that she and Austin fought, that bro-con will take the chance to comfort her brother.\nAnd Luna didn't want to let that happen.\nBut now the problem arose with where she could go. Since it was already night, she didn't want to sit in the garden too.\n'Well, I haven't been there in ages, so why now... '\nHer answer came not so long after as she started marching toward the place where she enjoyed her peaceful silence before meeting Austin.\nAlong the way, she remembered how she behaved with him because of the incident in which Austin had no option but to partake.\nBut even so, she didn't like seeing her man kissing someone else, even if it was for saving her life. People died, and so Sicily could have.\nIn a way, she knew it was wrong to treat this matter in this way, but she couldn't calm her heart so instantly. And truth be told, she would have doubted her love for Austin if not for this bitter feeling that had arisen after seeing him like that in the labyrinth.\nAnd not to talk that Austin didn't even persuade her to stop. Even her heart was clenching in pain when she saw his sad face but even so...even so...\n'No, I shouldn't. Don't fall weak now, Luna. You have to be angry with him... Hmph! \"\nDetermining not to waver from her resolve, Luna made her way to the academy's main building after shrouding herself with invisibility to avoid attention.\nCentral Library.\nWhen Luna entered the Eden Academy and joined the hero's party, she often spent her time reading books here and enjoyed the silence she was provided with.\nApart from the world, under the layer of darkness, where no one gaze upon her nor gets disturbed by anyone's presence, she enjoyed such an atmosphere.\nBut unlike in the past, she wasn't alone in the library.\n\"H-How are you here?! \"\nWith a look of complete bafflement, Luna asked the person who was sitting at the table right opposite the entrance.\nDue to the chaos rumbling inside her head, she couldn't detect even such a familiar man who seemed to be waiting for her.\n\"I knew you would come here, so I just dragged my feet a little faster. \"\nAustin detached his back from the table before making his way toward the perplexed Luna, who had never thought to meet Austin this soon.\nThe way she left him, Luna thought it would take him time to reflect on what he did but to her utmost surprise, Austin was already here to confront her.\nWalking silent yet heavy steps toward her, Luna instinctively stepped back as she gazed at Austin's slightly fierce gaze. It seemed the roles had reversed where she would have been on the aggressive side, but now, Austin seemed annoyed for some reason.\n\"A-Austin, don't come near me.... \"\nLuna wanted to disappear for some reason, but under his sharp gaze, she nearly forgot that she was a mage, not a damsel.\n\"And what would happen if I come near you, Luna? Will you attack me or run away again?\"\nHis voice neared, and so he did. Slowly and steadily, under the flustered gaze of Luna, Austin made his way toward her before he slammed his hand on either side of the girl, caging her in the kabedon*.\n\"Auu... \"\nLuna, like a small child, felt herself frail in front of Austin's broad figure as he gazed upon her with the same eyes filled with a strange glint.\nLeaning his face, his hot breath made Luna's face flushed.\n\"You know you have hurt me by telling me to think up something like that. You know I have seen you having romance with Kyouki in my past life, so you could guess whose face would have popped into my head when I tried to imagine what you asked me to. \"\nLuna's mouth parted since she never thought Austin would take her word so seriously and also would get hurt in that way.\nShe herself was embarrassed to see her drawing self being intimate with the hero, but that wasn't the real Luna. She wouldn't do such a thing when she has Austin for her!\nBut she forgot that primarily she was angered because of him, but now it seemed Luna was in the wrong.\n\"I-I won't do such a thing with anyone, Austin.\"\nLuna brought her hand to his chest as she spoke in a hazy voice and pleaded with her eyes glittering slightly.\n\"And if I tell you the same that I won't do it again ever with anyone, would you believe me.\"\nLuna instinctively was about to nod when she realized that it wasn't her who should be confronted, as she was the victim, not him.\nTurning her bead with her gaze shifting to a colder tone, Luna answered after collecting herself.\n\"No, I won't, and I will not forgive you too. \"\nAustin didn't back away since he never intended to accept defeat here.\n\"Then look at my eyes and tell me that you won't forgive me. Tell me that after leaving this place, you would stop talking about me and soon would also come to hate me with the time. And since we are at it, tell me that one day you will forget about me and leave my side. \"\nAs Austin spoke, Luna became flustered as she turned her head with her eyes wide open.\n\"I won't do that...why are you speaking like this, Austin. It's hurting me to even think about it. \"\n\"Yes, now you understand how mere words can affect someone? Now you understand how painful it was for me. \"\nLuna lowered her eyes in shame as she understood what he said and why he was so agitated.\nIn a whispering tone, she asked in a sweet voice.\n\"What can I do for Austin's forgiveness? \"\n\"Simple. Kiss me.\"\nLuna shot up her head in surprise but seeing Austin's gaze unchanged; she figured it was the least she could do as compensation.\nClosing her eyes tightly, Luna leaned forward and pressed her lips against him. Separating her cushion, she pecked the second and third time.\nAustin found it cute how she initiated the kiss, but he was far from satisfied.\nResting his left arm on the door, he tucked his finger on either side of her ear before leaning for a deep kiss.\nLuna was caught off guard, but she didn't reject him; however, she wasn't cooperating either. She just stood there at the mercy of her lover.\nAustin sucked on her lower lip before separating for a second and leaving an audible wet sound along with it. He did the same for her other lip while gazing at her without a blink.\nTilting his head, he entered inside her mouth and hugged her back along the movement.\nLuna was utterly captivated by him as she felt her legs going noodles under such heavy love; Austin was pouring on her.\nThe vulgar sound of wild and continuous kissing resonated in the silent library as Austin grabbed Luna's ass and made her jump on him, which she did on the spur.\nPushing her back on the door, Luna also got lost in the kiss as she violently nailed his back and grabbed the back of his hair because of the exciting sensation she was feeling.\nAustin only halted his attacks when he felt Luna going short on air.\nSeparating their lips, a silver thread was still connected, signifying their passion and desire for each other.\nWitnessing Luna's gasping mouth and moist eyes which seemed utterly erotic, Austin leaned forward before whispering in a hoarse tone.\n\"Tonight, I won't be making love. I will fuck you hard, to show you how angry I am. \"\n**Gulp**\nWith her breathing getting heavier, Luna muttered in a soft tone as her heart thumped violently.\n\"Please try to be a little ah~! \"\n__________________\nA/N: - They weren't making sense in the chapter but doesn't people become silly in love?\nAnyway, I will be writing R18 of this night so if you want they, you can visit my patreon: -\n/Svneighter",

He wanted her there, and then, so he took what he desired without restraint.\nHearing her confusion, Austin turned himself toward her before hugging Luna in between his arms and replying in a soothing tone.\n\"After you passed out, I thoroughly cleaned the library and took you here. Sorry for pushing you that hard last night.\"\nLuna's face was already red due to the remembrance of the activities she partook in last night.\nThe vulgar begging she did, the things she admitted to be...and....and....\n\"Ahhh! I hate you to make me like that.\"\nAustin blinked upon being hated so early in the morning, but soon he realized the reason, which made him grin ear to ear.\nIt was fortunate that Luna was hiding her face in his chest, or she might have gotten more irritated by seeing him being so delighted upon such a shameful thing.\n\"You didn't like it...or are you just shy to admit that you loved it?\"\nAustin teased the girl who was fidgeting in his embrace because of the nervousness and shame.\n\"Don't ask me, baka! I can't possibly answer to such thing.\"\nWith a strong 'Hmph! ' Luna firmly hugged Austin to show her anger before the room fell silent.\nAustin had a soft smile spread across his face as he soothed the embarrassed girl by running his fingers across her hair.\nAfter a slight pause, Austin spoke about the discovery he had made recently.\n\"Luna, my system has been updated. And now it gives me a short mission along with rewards.\"\nLuna blinked twice before separating her face from the warmth, and after directing her gaze toward him, she asked what seemed plausible after tomorrow's incident.\n\"So saving Sicily was your mission?\"\nAustin responded with a nod.\n\"Hmm...now that's interesting. The system changed its functioning. So did you get any reward from it?\"\nAustin nodded as he was about to tell her about the new features added to the system, along with the time leaping function, when they heard two strong knocks on his door.\n**KNOCK**KNOCK**\nAustin sensed it was a familiar person, so he got up hurriedly before draping some clothes and turning the doorknob to let the person in.\n\"Offo, Onii-sama. How can you leave me like that wi-\"\n\"Wait, Saya.\"\nAustin held Saya's shoulder from letting her step in; as he suddenly remembered something, he turned toward Luna with a dry smile.\n\"Luna. The barrier.\"\nLuna and Saya blinked in perplexion before the prior one finally realized what Austin was speaking about.\nPulling her hand out of the sheet, Luna snapped her finger before the entrance of the door shined with a greenish hue before the illumination turned into small butterflies and disappeared in a couple of blinks.\n\"....amazing.\"\nSaya couldn't help praising such a fine mana spell. Since Saya had not met high ranking mage until now and also given her low proficiency with mana, it made her marvel at such a sight in pure admiration.\n\"I can teach you if you want, imouto-chan.\"\nSaya got out of her stupor as she heard the voice of her rival before she turned toward her brother, not caring about the person in the background anymore.\n\"Why did Onii-sama leave like that yesterday? Saya was very worried. \"\nAustin brought his hand over his beloved's head as he soothed her anxiety.\n\"Sorry, Saya. Yesterday so many things happened that I forgot that I left you hanging.\"\nSaya received the pats wholeheartedly as she side glanced at the beauty sleeping on the bed before Saya muttered under her breath.\n\"A lot of things, huh...I bet it's all because of her.\"\n\"I can hear you, Imouto-chan.\"\nSaya sneered before she felt the warmth over her head disappear.\n\"What's in your hand, Saya?\"\nAustin asked as he saw an envelope in her hand which had Eden Academy's seal on it.\n\"Uh-yeah. It was at your doorstep.\"\nSaya handed the envelope before Austin studied it for any trap or curse spell but found nothing.\nScratching the partition, Austin took out the small paper from inside before reading it in thoroughly in seconds.\n\"Who is it from, Austin?\"\nLuna became impatient to know as she asked after straightening her back on the bed. Saya was always eager to know the content, but she chose to wait patiently.\n\"It's from the headmaster. He asked me to meet ASAP. Wanna join Luna?\"\n\"Yes, sure.\"\n\"Onii-sama...me?\"\nSaya sulked pitifully since she had spent a day without her brother, and now too, he has only asked Luna, not her.\n\"I can't, Saya since you aren't an official admitted to the school, so bear with it; I will do something about it soon.\"\nSaya dropped her gaze since she knew it already, but still, it was disheartening to know that she couldn't be seen in the school with her brother.\nAustin understood his sister's trouble, but for now, he could do nothing.\n\"Get ready, Luna. Let's see what he has to say.\"\n___________\nA/N: - Can anyone let me know whether I should keep the pace or should I speed up?\nIt might take out some detail but I can surely fasten the plot.\nLet me know in the comment section~",

      "content": "**Knock**\n\"Come in.\"\nAs the grumpy voice of an older man responded to the knock, two young youths stepped inside the room, which by furniture looked like an office.\nThe two who entered were the most gossiped couple of the Eden Academy currently, Luna and Austin.\nAfter having breakfast with Saya in Austin's room, they changed after taking a shower and arrived at the headmaster's office because of the summoning letter Austin found in the morning.\nIt was the first time Austin was stepping here officially since he never did something worthy enough to be called by the principal, but yes, he did receive a warning notice from the bearded mage.\nA sense of reminiscence arose inside as he remembered how things changed in so less time.\nThe white-beard magician, Merlin, gestured both of them to sit as he also took the big chair at the front desk.\n\"Please have a seat.\"\nAfter they sat, a set of cups plate along with a teapot levitated and landed on the table softly.\n\"What tea would you like to have?\"\n\"Lemon tea.\"\nLuna replied instinctively since she was already craving the tea she tasted in Xylex. She didn't expect it to be the same, but if it could be near to it, she would be delighted.\n\"The one from the Ramen shop, huh?\"\nAustin and Luna blinked at each other before the prior one asked slightly perplexedly.\n\"Have you been there, headmaster?\"\nAkiko's ramen shop was famous but not to the point where it could become a landmark. Merlin knowing about such a place and even so when the shop hadn't been started working for that long, made the discovery a little questioning worthy.\n\"I just stumbled at that place while observing the aftermath.\"\nHis words were entirely subjective, with lots of trails here and there.\nAustin understood what 'aftermath' Merlin was talking about and how he could have 'stumbled' upon the shop, which belonged to a summoned being.\nOn the other side, Luna was...just waiting for her tea.\nShe doesn't like to use her brain much this early in the morning.\nMerlin poured the content after it was heated into three cups before placing it with some fluffy bread toward the two.\n\"So, why did the busy headmaster have to take some time to invite me?\"\nAustin came to the end of the chase since he already had an idea of what it was about, and Austin also wanted to talk about it relatively sooner than later.\nMerlin sipped his tea before nodding in admiration toward Luna's choice as he brought up the conversation he could only have with these two.\n\"You already have figured about this...\"\n**TAP*TAP**\nAs he spoke, he tapped his mage staff on the ground signifying the wormhole which was unknowingly opened yesterday.\n\"Can I ask what you saw after you infiltrated the office?\"\nAustin nodded before he peeked inside his memory to search for any evident fact he might have seen but failed to pay attention at that time.\nAfter a minute or so, Austin spoke with a bit of uncertainty.\n\"Well, I did feel an unnatural remnant of mana presence, but it was faint enough that I wasn't able to discern the first chain of the spell. Other than that, I don't have anything else.\"\nThere are several circles drawn to cast a spell. The first mana chain is the first layer of magic that construct a structure of the magic formation.\nWhat Austin felt was only the outer layer, which couldn't e used to analyze who the person was or what was his mana signature.\n\"Well, it's surprising you were able to catch even that since my mana detectors were just lying idly, and also the professors I have assigned this room to.\"\nMerlin muttered under his breath as he thought of the two secretive guards the Capital has assigned to protect Headmaster.\n\"How the Eight Patch Seal got broken, old man? I am still surprised here.\"\nLuna spoke in a neutral tone as she poured herself another cup of tea without minding the courtesy.\nMerlin forwarded some piece of bread cake to his student before he responded to her not-so-curious query.\n\"There is a nemesis of everything. Mana seals aren't vulnerable to any kind of magic other than Curses. But this wasn't just a seal, so I presume it was a high-ranking mage engaged in the treason.\"\n\"Then what about Sicily? How come she was here at that moment?\"\nAs Luna asked, she thanked Austin, who wiped the small chunks of bread from her cheek as she heard the older one speaking.\n\"I still haven't been able to ask her because of her condition. But I don't think it would matter.\"\nAustin was staring straight, but his mind was spacing out for some seconds as he deeply contemplated about something after he finally got the time inside the office.\n\"Headmaster Merlin. Where were you, yesterday?\"\nAustin's query came so abruptly that the bearded mage became a little baffled, but he responded not so long after.\n\"I was called by Your Majesty for some confidential purpose.\"\n\"Hmmm...Headmaster, have you hired every professor after checking their background?\"\nAs Austin's words left his lips and Luna's cake got dropped in her tea mistakenly, the room went silent for several seconds.\nNot so long after, with a grim expression, the cols voice of Merlin reached up to the blog youth opposite him.\n\"Are you suggesting that someone from inside the school is involved?\"\nAustin, on the other end, wasn't bothered with such a tone as he spoke nonchalantly.\n\"I have an artifact planted at every corner of the school which lets me know if someone trespasses its boundary if they had even an essence of curse in them. Since it has a limitless range of tracks, no one, I repeat, even Monarch Level curse users, wouldn't be able to hide their presence. And from what you are telling me, I didn't sense any person carrying curse energy entering inside after you left, so what's left is...\"\n\"....Insiders.\"\nAustin nodded as the headmaster concluded right.\nMerlin's wrinkle-weighing eyes were visibly spread wide as he heard such absurd deduction, which seemed plausible for some reasons.\nIt was hard to believe that such a ridiculous artifact really does exist, but Merlin didn't dare to sneer at Austin.\nFrom what he had seen, Austin wasn't the regular person whom he seemed to be past six months. To take the youth's words lightly would be the last thing Merlin would allow himself to do.\nAfter a brief pause, a sigh left the older one as he rubbed his eyes and brought up the request he mainly called Austin for.\n\"Austin, I know I am in no position to request something like this when I have treated you like that....but Austin, can you fulfill two requests of mine. And before you outright reject, please hear me out, what I have to offer in return.\"\nAustin wasn't going to reject it before hearing it, but when the compensation was mentioned, the conversation became a whole lot more interesting.\nSeeing Austin nod, Merlin exhaled deeply first before uttering the idea he has thinking about for a while now.\n\"Can you..teach the professors and students of Eden's Academy.\"\n______________________\nA/N: - Will continue the next chapter from this point.\nDrop a comment~",

      "content": "\"Can you repeat that again?\"\nWith his brows raised in astonishment, Austin leaned slightly forward as he raised his voice to confirm whether he heard the Headmaster's request right or not.\n\"Austin being a professor with a stick in hand...hmm~.\"\nLuna, after finishing her tea, got a new time pass as she started imagining some of the things which children should better not know about.\n(A/n: - Luna and her kinks*sigh*)\nMerlin focused on the boy in front, and after thinking again about the decision, he spoke with a little more certainty this time.\n\"You and Luna both are very well aware of what kind of catastrophes are rising at such consecutive rates. It feels that monstrosities are developing, but we aren't. The rate of demons' appearance has risen so much recently that I fear we might lose our footing without even being able to counter properly.\"\nWhat Merlin said was all true.\nSince the time Austin started his academy life, the incidents with demons have leveled a whole lot.\nFrom minor stampedes or large massacres, the demons have actively gotten involved with humans in one way or another.\nNot to talk about the incident with Xylex where it was clearly exposed, how demons submitted to humans. It was a terrifying thing to witness that monsters who only have loyalty toward their liege, Monarch of Darkness, were following the orders of those beings, who were way weaker than them.\n\"You and Luna are the irregulars among the irregular. But you both can't protect everyone, and since they are not your responsibility, I won't either ask you to help them. But Austin as a student of Eden Academy, can I request you to teach the students a little something so, at the very least, they could protect themselves to some extent.\"\nGrandmaster Merlin wasn't an everyday mage or principal. He's a renowned magician who has been standing at the top tier of hierarchy since the time Austin didn't even exist in either world.\nFor such a person to plea in front of a mere teenager was a sight that could make thousands gasp in shock. But here he was, utterly devoid of any ego or any other emotion other than genuine desperation for Austin's help.\nMore than saving humanity from fall, Merlin cared about none.\n\"Hmmm..\"\nAustin fell back on his chair with his eyes relaxed as he thought about the request for a brief moment.\nIt was true that he wouldn't bother to save everyone's arses if some unexpected event unfolds this very moment. But he might help the students to at least learn how to retreat safely from a situation that seems impossible to deal with.\nThere wasn't any gain, but there wasn't any drawback too. And since he needed a favor from Headmaster , this offer would be perfect bargain.\n\"Okay, I will do what I can. But in return, headmaster, I want permission to let a relative of mine stay in the school. I hope it will be fine, right?\"\n\"Che! Sis-con.\"\nAustin ignored Luna for now as he made his request since it would help Saya to move more freely in the school.\nMerlin didn't even think for a second, before responding in affirmation.\nAnother set of tea was served as in to congratulate the admission of the new professor before Austin brought the next matter to light.\n\"What about your second request, Headmaster?\"\nThe room suddenly went a little more silent than it already was as Merlin, after putting back the cup on the plate, sat upright while facing the two.\nWith a long exhale, the bearded man tapped his palm on the table before lifting it steadily and conjuring a thing beneath his palm.\nIt was a purple cube with thin golden lines drawn at uncertain points. Even Austin and Luna tried to sense it; they didn't feel any kind of mana from it; even the cube looked nothing less than a high-grade artifact.\n\"This...I want you to keep this in your protection. What's inside this definitely would benefit you, but I would request not to try opening it until it doesn't naturally split up.\"\nAustin took the cube and examined it before passing it to Luna.\nThe Silver Haired saint appraised the thing with a top-tier spell but didn't find any trap or hidden danger in it, so she handed back the box to Austin.\n\"Don't worry, headmaster. I would fulfill both of your requests.\"\n________________________\n[Some days earlier]\nA day ago, before the labyrinth incident in the Eden Academy, a similar occurrence happened in a forest far away from the academy.\nIn a vast forest where nothing than greenery could be seen stood two people, covered in the purplish fluid, which by density seemed like blood.\nOne of them, by physique looked like a massive man with dark raven hair covering his face as he held his sword in a tight grip while surveying the surrounding.\nThe other one, despite being in such a horrifying state, still could be defined as a beautiful girl whose charm was only enhanced by the blood she got covered in.\n\"I could have handled it on my own, Papa.\"\nVanessa spoke in a low tone as she swung her composite sword to splash the fluid away, which she got from a certain someone.\n\"Don't try to act tough in front of your father, little one.\"\nCharles planted his blade on the ground before ruffling his daughter's hair, much to the latter's annoyance, but still, she didn't reject it.\n\"So why did my little princess decide to leave the Academy suddenly?\"\nVanessa knew it was coming, but she didn't want to answer him. However she also knew it was nearly impossible to just say bye-bye to her father from this point.\n\"I just want to become strong.\"\n\"That is a half-truth. Come on, tell me what it is or I would pick you up and drop you in the Eden's Academy and will only after ensuring that you won't leave the premise before graduation.\"\nVanessa pouted since it was too unfair of her papa to treat her like a child when she finally took such a serious step in life.\nBut again, she knew it was her parents who cared for her without any hidden intent. To leave them without words, would not be fair on her part.\n\"I-I want to become worthy to stand beside Austin.\"\nShe felt fortunate that her face was practically hidden behind the blood since her blush would have made a fool out of her.\nCharles fell silent for several seconds, when Venessa slowly raised her face before asking.\n\"Are you disappointed in me, father?\"\nIt seemed Charles suddenly got out of his stupor as he replied with a big smile on his face.\n\"Of course not. I can never be disappointed in my daughter. It was just I felt like seeing myself in you. Just like you, Venessa, I also became stronger than anyone in order to hold your mother's hand confidently.\"\nVanessa's eyes went slightly round in astonishment as she felt Charles patting her head before he spoke the parting words.\n\"Do whatever you want, Venessa. Strive to be the strongest and pursue what you desire. And if ever you feel like there might be consequences of your action, then don't worry. Your father would always be standing on your back.\"\nVanessa smiled brightly before she nodded with her eyes closed in elation as her resolve become even stronger.\nAfter a little more chat, Venessa parted ways as she moved in an uncertain direction, leaving the big man Charles all alone at the site.\n\"*Sigh* Kids really does grow too quick.\"\nWith a sigh he turned his head, before his gaze became sharp as daggers as he looked in a certain direction.\n\"Now let's see who the fuck dared to harm my princess.\"\n____________________\nA/N: - Drop a comment. And tell me, whether I should be keep posting about Venessa? She would return after a while but keeping her out of the story would be a little unfair.\nPlease suggest me in the comments",

      "content": "Its been a week since the meeting between Austin and Headmaster concluded with certain requests being accepted by both parties.\nSicily also recovered from her injuries with the top-notch healer providing their services in the school infirmary.\nLuna could have healed Sicily within minutes, but why she didn't even spare a glance at the olive-haired mage supporter was only known by Austin.\nFrom her testimony, it seemed that she found a letter stating that the headmaster had summoned her.\nSince the notice was to report within an hour, Sicily didn't inform others and went there alone, only to get pushed into a hole in the end.\nAs one could guess, Sicily didn't see the person face who nearly took her life by throwing her into the labyrinth. Even the Cerebral Interference spell wasn't able to dig out any valuable clue from her.\nSaya was extremely delighted these days since she got permission from her Onii-sama that she could wander in the school without restraint now.\nSome students tried to talk to her, and some even dared to take her as her fiancee only after seeing her for once. Given how peculiarly beautiful Saya is, the teenager's reaction was justifiable to some extent.\nWell, only until they didn't cross the line and tried to get physical.\n\"Suddenly, why the infirmary looks so populated more than the classroom.\"\nThat was one of the nurses who spoke as she saw the number of injured students being dragged after getting knocked out by the Raven-haired beauty.\nSome had the intent to take revenge, some still hadn't given up on the woman, and for some reason, a lot of boys had ecstatic smiles on their faces.\nSlowly but surely, every student had returned to Eden's Academy after a short break to avoid the war and the repercussions of its aftermath.\nParents of various have asked for assurance from the school about their children's safety which the school didn't even try to bother.\nEden Academy never invites students to study here, nor do they ask for any basic tuition fee. The Academy is solely based on the motto to develop the youths into such fine young warriors that they never have to seek anyone's protection in the future.\nOn the path to becoming an entity worthy of being known across lands, one has to take some pains and risks so, in the future, they could shine the brightest.\n-----------------------\nInside a wide auditorium could be seen hundreds of students crowding near the stage as they chatted leisurely while waiting for the event to start for which they got summoned.\nAll three years were called into the hall, where they stood in groups.\nThe first-year uniform consists of a dark blue and white combination. The male had a white blazer with blue stripes along with, the same shade of formal trousers, and a necktie. Females were given a one-piece uniform with a white top attached to the blue skirt, along with a thin belt on the waist and a red bowtie.\nThe second year's had a combination of Amber and Raven shades. And third, years wore similar texture clothing with black and white coloring.\nThird-year uniforms looked a little adult-like since they depicted formal suits and gave a majestic feeling to the wearer.\nAmong the first years stood the hero's party, too, with Sicily, Kyouki, and Lilia being the only ones left. Luna was also nearby, standing alone, but her aura was so dense that no one dared to approach her.\nIt was a rare occasion for each year to gather in one place. Although not certain, students got a gist that this was about the war which occurred some days ago and also might be the appearance of the new woman who was suspected to be a professor.\nAfter half an hour or so, a man in his late twenties stepped forward with a stern expression on his face.\nThis person was a renowned professor of Eden Academy and also in charge of the homeroom of all the elite batches in the academy.\nProfessor S. Leone.\nWalking to the podium, he tapped his wand twice on the wood, which made a low yet heavy voice across the hall and brought everyone's attention to the stage.\n\"Good evening, class. I know you all must have plans for the weekend, but this matter needs your immediate concern, so here we are.\"\nHis voice, despite being slightly shrill, gave an authoritative vibe as every eye got fixated on the lean man, who continued after a slight pause.\n\"I know you all are aware of the war which took place on the outlines of Eden's Academy. Some of you witnessed the catastrophe, and some of you only heard about it. But what makes all of you a single unit, is the powerlessness you carry. And it's not limited to only students. The guards, the professors, including me, and even the Grand Master Merlin isn't capable of dealing with that amount which we faced some days ago.\"\nThe faces of most students leaned down in shame, and some were plainly astonished since the speaker casually degraded the headmaster. But little did they know that Leone spoke only after what he had seen on the battlefield.\nThe professors standing in the aisle didn't waver from the bold statement since they also accepted their weakness against the hordes of demons.\nThe hall suddenly went dead silent before ever. Only after a couple of seconds, the ice was broken by Leone as he continued with his speech.\n\"This time, the Eden Academy became the battlefield. What about next time? Maybe the whole nation could become a division of red alert? Where will the students hide then?\"\nThe slightly aggrieved tone made those who ran away from the fear of war, shiver in a fret as they didn't dare to lift their gaze.\nBut even with the shame, they knew what Leone was saying held credibility. If a horde of demons was able to shake one of the most strongest forts in the whole Gram nation, then what about an army of demons?\nStudents were unable to even imagine about it, and the same was for Hero's party. They were getting stronger, but with this development speed, they might not be able to withstand another war.\n\"So what are we supposed to do, professor? We are learning what we have been taught in the Academy. More than this, what can we do?\"\nOne of the third year, who happened to be a student union member, spoke in an audible tone across the auditorium.\n\"You are correct, student Lewis. You all are doing what you can, but that wouldn't be enough from now. We all have to do something more to become a better version of ourselves. And for that, we need support which can uplift not only the students but us, professors too.\"\nThe noise of little chattering erupted from the groups as they heard Leone's words.\nThe assistance he spoke of wasn't just for Academy students but for the professors too. That meant teachers would also be learning along with the students!\nAfter a small pause, Leone finally brought the topic for which this whole event was organized.\n\"Please welcome the newly appointed professor of Eden Academy who will be teaching us various arts from now on. Sir Austin!\"\n_______________________\nA/N: - This is going to be a little awkward. Should I write chapters of Austin tutoring students or just explain it briefly along the lines?\nLemme know in the comments~",

      "content": "The hall was dead silent.\nThe quietness was so sharp in the auditorium after a certain someone appeared on the stage that teeth gnashing might have been heard if listened closely.\nEvery eye stared at the handsome blond youth standing at the center wearing a red robe which undoubtedly belonged to the typical uniform which every professor wears.\nCoupled with the statement that Professor Leone threw earlier about students leveling up and all, it was undeniable that Austin was the newly appointed tutor.\nSome students had look in disbelief. Some were like that they expected such a conclusion. But the problem arose from those who got utterly aggrieved by the fact that a mere teenager would be teaching them.\n\"Is it some kind of joke?\"\n\"Isn't he just a first-year newbie rank?\"\n\"Are we going to get instructed by such a noble disgrace?\"\nSmall murmurs started erupting from the audience before a bold and scornful voice was raised as in to voice the thoughts of other chatterers.\n\"Isn't it disgraceful to put such a shamed noble above us all, Professor Leo? Or is it that Eden Academy has lost all their confidence in a single war?\"\n\"Isn't it better if we just go back and study from our servants if the Academy is no longer capable of providing with a proper teacher?\"\n\"Why is that person on stage when I can beat him anytime? I don't know what I would gain from learning from someone who's weaker than me.\"\nThose who were shouting such baseless accusations and contempt were mostly third-years who didn't believe about Austin's contribution to the school protection.\nAustin, on the other hand, anticipated such development. That's why he didn't even react a single bit, even though he was getting disdained from all around. He just felt fortunate that he already had convinced Luna not to react if something like this happens, but now he worries about how long she could hold.\n'Her expression doesn't look good. '\n**CLING**\nSuddenly a blade slashing noise erupted from the stage which quieted down the crowd in the process.\nFocusing his gaze on the front, Austin never noticed that someone from the audience had advanced to the stage as the person stood with his back facing Austin.\nWhat the groups of students saw was the massive remarkable blade that was only built for a single entity, the hero.\nWith his back straightened, Kyouki stood with his hand placed on the butt of the handle and the tip of the blade on the wooden stage.\nHis eyes were cold enough to share a frightening shiver among the third years as they heard a heavy voice resonating from the person in front.\n\"If anyone doubts Austin's capability, then duel with me. Only any of you can beat me; you will find the chance to take Austin on since, by any means, Austin is far stronger than me. So make it quick and come at me.\"\nHis voice was stern, unlike his usual self, which stays cheerful and bright all the time. Not to talk about the severeness in his gaze, which explicitly told how serious he was with his words.\nThose who were shaming Austin and those who were thinking of him as a weakling halted their mouth in an instant.\nEven though the hero wasn't a warrior to face a whole army alone, but it doesn't change the fact he still is way above than average students.\nChallenging a hero would not only bring disgrace from the outside world but also the chance of getting killed in the process lies in the possibility.\nNo one dared to utter a single word from that point onward.\nKyouki surveyed the audience for once before turning toward Austin.\nThe blond youth had a surprised look on his face as the verbal taunts were lopped smoother than he thought.\n\"Thanks, man.\"\n\"No problem.\"\nWith a nod, Kyouki walked away from the stage as he stood at his previous spot.\nFor some reason, Kyouki felt Luna was glaring at his back intently, which made his forehead covered in sweat since he knew why she was annoyed with him.\nWalking with a steady step, Austin moved forward before the first of words were spoken.\n\"Okay then, let's get over with this real quick.\"\n___________________\nAt the same time, in a beautiful garden where various colorful flowers, along with the pleasant evening sun peeking from the horizon, sat an incredibly gorgeous girl.\nBy looks, she seemed to be in her teenage but the aura she carried around made people think that they are greeting a prominent noble in the appearance of a girl.\nThis woman was none other than the eldest princess of Gram, Tiara.\nHer platinum blond hair which covered her forehead and braided on her back, shimmered elegantly in the sunlight as she sipped the milk tea.\nIt was one of her habits to sit alone in peace and think about the person whom she desired most to have.\n'I wonder what he is doing right now... '\nMight be the lady luck has blessed her today, as the spy which she has been planted on the Eden Academy suddenly arrived near her, before kneeling on the ground with his fist thumped on his chest.\n\"Greetings, Your highness.\"\n\"Tell me.\"\nTiara didn't bother looking at the man as she asked in between her sips before she picked the cookie in her hand, only to break it in the end after hearing the report.\n\"I just got the intel that Sir Austin would be now teaching in the academy for a temporary basis.\"\nHer eyes widened as she dropped the broken cookie and looked at the man with astonishment.\n\"Are you completely sure, about what you just said?\"\n\"My neck would compensate if my words come out untrue.\"\nComplete silence fell in the garden as Taira instructed the spy to go away.\nTiara rested her back on the chair as she thought about the information she had gotten.\nA sadistic smile formed on her lips as she thought of something truly unladylike before a an idea emerged in her mind.\n'Seems it finally time for me to get proper academic knowledge~.'\n___________________\nA/N: - Now here comes the yandere in light.

War was undergoing, to be precise.\nAt that time, a fine young man emerged with the support of the First Emperor. That young man was the pioneer of the Academy and grandfather of the current headmaster of Eden Academy.\nThe timeline of the family of Grandmasters was so imbalanced that in the period of ten Emperors' lifetime, only three of the Grandmasters appeared and helped Gram in various means.\nThe recruitment of faculties in the Academy isn't done on a diploma or achievement basis. Principals themselves take the role of appointing who is worthy of teaching at the academy.\nThat goes for students too.\nWhoever has the talent and strength to pass the entrance exam can only enter the gates of the ultimate temple of learning.\nFrom the beginning, no one thought there would be a time when a student would take charge of tutoring dignified professors and elite students.\nThe piece of news that a mere student previously evaluated as Newbie class no less would be appointed at such a position and provide tutelage so the members of Eden Academy could prepare for any unforeseen danger in the future made various from the outside world go insane.\nBut that didn't stop things from taking place inside the Academy.\nAfter the announcement, the students were divided into four divisions.\nThe first group consisted of 400 students who have proficiency with Elemental Type Magice.\nThe second group had 700 students who had the ability to conjure their spells. This and the first group were differentiated by a lot of trouble, but after Austin thoroughly told them the theory behind the conjurors and element users, groups were formed without much hassle.\nThe third was the Inheritance type group, along with the Cerebral field of magic and Healing type. This was the least populated group since not many get something from their ancestors in their bloodline, and if about Psychic Wizards, then one could even count on fingers how many are them.\nThe last group contained those who excel in physical prowess. The augmenter and warrior class students, who rely primarily on their limbs and weapons, joined the group and made this team the densest with a number of a thousand students.\nThe first and second group was monitored by Austin himself, but as one could expect, he isn't a supreme deity being who has reach in every field.\nSo what he did was ask for help.\nThe third group was supervised by the Saintess of Humanity, Luna.\nAnd for the last group...\n\"I am so lucky that I chose this group. Ah...I wish she steps on me someday...\"\n\"Hey, look at those...I wonder they would fit in my grip...\"\n\"Like hell, you could even touch our goddess. She isn't for only one. Goddess is for everyone!\"\nThese kinds of awe-filled conversations were flowing among the students as they saw a black-haired, amazingly proportionate woman walking onto the stage, built in the field.\nUnlike with her brother, when her eyes contain nothing but genuine love and gentleness, her current self of Saya was looking extremely domineering.\nWearing a sleeveless top that exposed her toned stomach along with black pants, which helped her move unrestrainedly, Saya halted in the middle of the wooden platform before turning her head toward the crowd.\nKyouki was on the front row as he saw Saya, but unlike in the past when he had seen her fawning over Austin all over the place, she seemed utterly different.\n\"So you are the lot which I have to teach how to hold a steel, eh...\"\nHer voice, despite not being backed with mana, resonated heavily around the field, reaching to everyone as some of them became shunned in astonishment to hear their goddess speaking for the first time.\n\"Before that...first, you have to show your worth to be here.\"\nSome of the students frowned in perplexion as they heard something they had never thought of. An exam to be in class was simply absurd, but before anyone could have voiced their thoughts, something massive happened.\nA sheer pressure that felt like a heavy boulder weighing on their shoulder, made the warrior shudder in a fret.\nIt felt like their worst nightmare had arisen right before their eyes as a black shadow above the stage appeared with its blood-red eyes staring into the very soul of each individual.\nVarious from the third year knew it was just an illusion of the raven-haired woman's aura. But who could stand still when death was seemingly felt this close to their mortal thread?\n\"Wield your weapon, and I will consider you my student.\"\nSaya's voice amidst the mental chaos reverberated as she planted the tip of her blade on the platform and dared the students to take upon the challenge.\nIn all honesty, she wanted everyone to back away so she could enjoy her time with her brother. And in the first place, she didn't have much experience in teaching someone other than her brother, who is a good listener.\nBut against her expectations, someone pulled his sword and took an impressive stance with a hulking roar.\n\"Haaaaah!\"\nIt was Hero Kyouki who took the sword and stood without much difficulty. The amount of intent Saya poured was far from her best, so Kyouki didn't have much difficulty to stand against it.\nSlowly some of the other students, majorly those who solely practice their martial strengths, succeeded in pulling out their weapons one after another, through great trouble.\nThere were those too, who were falling on their knees because of the tremendous pressure which they had never felt before.\nThe number of fallen students was increasing vigorously when the intent suddenly was pulled back before a masculine voice reached up to the students.\n\"I told you not to overdo it. These are just students, Saya.\"\nUplifting their gazes, what they saw made various mouths open in utter shock.\nThe woman who looked almighty and arrogant a second ago was now bowing in front of Austin as she pleaded her apology.\n\"I am deeply sorry, Onii-sama. I got carried away.\"\nWith a sigh, Austin accepted his defeat before he brought his hand to Saya's head, much to everyone's gasp.\nSaya felt butterflies erupting in her belly as she enjoyed the caresses of her brother so openly.\nSo bold~\n\"Go a little easy on them, Saya.\"\nSaying so, Austin levitated away, leaving a disappointed imouto behind.\nRegaining her composure, Saya again turned her head toward the crowd as she spoke a little softer this time.\n\"Okay, now let's get onto the real thing, shall we?\"\n______________________\nAustin didn't go to check on Luna since he knew, Luna was a better teacher than he could ever become.\nHe already told those included in his class to manipulate their mana and convert it in an identifiable shape. That was the most challenging thing one could achieve as a beginner mage.\nSince he has read various novels and manga in his past life, mana manipulation was the first thing he learned at the age of ten. Now he has become a veteran in playing with his natural energy.\nHe was about to land in the gym where the elemental-type magician was practicing when an eagle-like paper flew up to him.\nCatching the bird, Austin realized it was a mana mail from the headmaster.\nScratching the seal, he read the content before a confused frown grew over his brows.\n[-Austin\nMeet me at my office. Someone from the Royal Palace has arrived and wants to meet you in person.\n-Merlin.]\n_____________________\nA/N: - I am taking this phase a little fast forwardly since it really doesn't matter to the main plot, to that extent.\nA little drama will surely ensue but don't worry nothing would ruin their relationship.\nDrop a comment~",

      "content": "**Knock**\n\"Come in.\"\nAs Austin knocked twice on the office door, a familiar voice allowed his entrance inside.\n\"Excuse me.\"\nSaying so, Austin stepped inside before closing the door on his back.\nIt didn't take him long to judge who came here to visit him, since he had already sensed this particular mana signature a week or so ago.\nBut just to his visual affirmation, his eyes went to the person who stood up from the chair upon Austin's arrival.\nPlatinum blond hair, azure eyes, and a petite yet well proportionate stature stood the first princess of the nation, Tiara der Gramduör.\nWith a bright smile currently adoring her lovely face, she pinched the hem of her gown before bowing elegantly.\n\"Even our first meeting wasn't the ideal one; I hope we can get along, Sir Austin.\"\nRemembering the hassle created in the ceremonial event due to Austin's entrance with the Ojou-sama, his brows twitched slightly.\nRegaining his composure, Austin also bowed before extending his greetings.\n\"Pleased to meet, Your Highness.\"\n\"Please trim the formalities, Sir Austin, since from now on, we would be sharing a relation which would make you my superior. \"\nPerplexed, Austin thought about what she said, before turning himself toward the white-bearded mage sitting across them while sipping on his tea.\n\"Headmaster?\"\n\"Umm....yeah. Princess Tiara wants to learn sorcery from you since she believes no one in the grand palace is capable of handling her.\"\nAustin blinked toward the principal in bafflement before turning his gaze toward the princess, and saw her still smiling, like being indirectly called spoilt, which didn't bother her.\nAustin knows that the mages in the capital aren't that high rankers, but still, they were way above the professors teaching in Eden Academy. Especially those magicians of the Royal Order who works under the supervision of Alex Nuèye.\nWell, it was understandable since the Royal Order doesn't generally get free time to do anything other than protect their nation. Whether it teleportation center's monitoring or surveillance of foreign countries, the court magician grinds all year long until they don't die because of exhaustion.\n\"I don't have a problem. Join whichever group suits your proficiency, Your Highness. You can ask for details from the principal. \"\nAustin bowed again and was about to excuse himself since he had various things left hanging back in the gym when Merlin spoke up.\n\"Austin...if possible, can you tutor her personally?\"\nBeing the highest nobility of the Gram, it was justifiable that Tiara wouldn't want to be seen being taught by some ex-noble teenager. There was a chance that the spies from the foreign lands might suspect the inner strength of The Gram palace crumbling, which resulted in the princess leaving her home to study.\nNo child of Emperor William, has left the palace to learn anything other than life experience. So this exception might bring some unwanted chaos.\nBut...\n\"Aren't you getting a little demanding, Headmaster?\"\nIt would be a lie to say that Merlin didn't expect such a response, given how much he had asked from Austin already. The case of Gram's reputation is one thing, but for that, he couldn't put all the burden on Austin.\nAnd in all honesty, Merlin wasn't sure when Austin would get up and leave the school since there isn't a single thing, this blond youth is gaining here whatsoever.\n\"I understand. I apologize, Austin.\"\nTiara seemed to be panicking because of the development since she never asked for private tutoring. Tho she wouldn't have minded it, but being alone with Austin might lead to her heart failure, so what Austin said, was in her interest too.\n\"Ano ne, Austin-san. Please treat me like others too, and I also apologize in Merlin-sama's stead.\"\nSaying so, Tiara bowed her head deeply as she also apologized for being so imposing, even though she just wanted to be near Austin.\nSeeing the two figures who were higher than him socially, Austin felt his brows tightening as he massaged his temple.\nWith a heavy sigh, he called his defeat as he spoke in a mild tone.\n\"Join the class I would be giving to the professor. By that, you won't get seen by students, and the chances of rumors would also fall off to some extent.\"\nRaising her head with surprise spread like a white sheet, Tiara blinked like an innocent child before a heart-warming smile curved her lips.\n\"Hai.\"\n_____________________\nAfter some hours, inside a room which by setting looked like a typical classroom with a blackboard attached to the wall and desk-benches arranged in a three-row divisions, sat numerous people.\nBut unlike from what one could expect, they weren't teenage students who were occupying these seats, but adult-looking men and women.\nThese people were the professors of Eden Academy who gathered in the classroom to get taught by someone they had always looked down upon.\nSome professors were annoyed at the start, but after remembering the war which occurred some weeks ago, they let go of their pride and sat obediently.\nPrincess Tiara also came to be taught by the professor as she sat separately from the others so the teacher could look at her particularly.\nAmidst the silence, a young youth walked inside the room.\nAustin got rid of his long red coat before hanging it on the pole along the way as he was getting heated up quite a lot in that new add-on of clothing.\nWalking up to the aisle, Austin naturally felt a little nervous since the position of the people inside has plainly swapped.\nBut it was just for some days, so he can manage somehow.\n\"Let's initiate today's class of basic spell formation.\"\nSince he had no idea how he should be commencing the lecture, he stuck to the straightforward method.\nAnd looking at the older one's expression, it seemed they didn't mind about such trivial things at all.\nAustin exhaled heavily before he unbuttoned his cuffs and folded his sleeves.\nLittle did he know that a certain someone was almost drooling on the sight as she somehow remained poker face while her inner mind screamed otherwise.\nTurning toward the audience, Austin formed a mana circle that had four rings drawn. The outermost ring was one meter in diameter, and the innermost measured 30 centimeters across.\n\"This formation is conjured for the spell Fireball beginner level. I know you all have realized it already.\"\nAs one could expect from the veteran mages, everyone nodded along with the princess as the fireball was one of the spells, one learns as their primary.\n\"How much time do we require to form such an average spell? From what I have observed, four seconds is for those who have been a mage for years or are simply talented, just like professor Emily.\"\nThe young brunette professor blushed slightly as she lowered her gaze and nodded along with the others.\nTiara didn't miss the reaction, but she kept it aside for now.\nFour seconds was a stretch for some professors, but if focused like a monk, they could pull up such spell in four seconds or even less.\nGetting everyone's affirmation, Austin continued.\n\"There are four mana circles, and the time required is four seconds. So does that mean each ring takes a second to form?\"\nAustin waved his hand before the illusionary mana circle got drawn upon the blackboard so that he could get a clear look at the students.\nHe didn't have to wait when one of the professors, who happened to be Austin's homeroom teacher, too, answered in a mild tone.\n\"No, it doesn't work like that. Every mana circle has its own roles, and it takes different times to create and regulate them to extract the best results.\"\n\"Correct, professor Blake. Each circle takes a different duration to get enchanted. But what if one of the circles gets skimmed over, but still the result concludes the same?\"\nThe room fell silent on Austin's subjective question as the professors looked at him in disbelief.\nWhat he said explicitly told that he intended to remove a mana circle but still would reach the same goal, albeit in a little less time.\nIt wasn't just close to impossible; it might cause havoc!\n\"I-Is that even possible, Sir Austin.\"\nTiara raised her voice since the older ones were too shocked even to utter a single word.\nHearing the meek tone, Austin smiled for a second before he displayed something which would change a whole lot of things from this day on.\n_____________________\nA/N: - I am trying to build the background through this chapter which I think is necessary.

      "content": "There are different kind of spell humanity have witnessed since ancient type. Not all those magic miracles need a typical circle to show their effect.\nThe skill of changing the natural phenomenon by utilizing the essence one is born with, known as mana, and converging that energy in a runic circle is commonly known as Conjuring.\nUnlike the Elemental type Magicians, who take the help of their surroundings to summon a spell, Conjurors doesn't rely on the uncertain background or any element around.\nConjurors create something out of nothing. And for that, any magi is required to form the mana circle, which determines what kind of spell they desire to release.\nThere are various kinds of spells that Conjuror type of magicians can cast but not available for elemental type. Not to mention the only necessity is to remember the spell formation, and the magi could survive in any kind of condition.\nNow about the Mana Circles.\nThe ancient language, which most magicians learn as their basic course, becomes the base of the spell formation.\nSince there isn't a single field of the spell, the number of mana rings varies according to the complexity of the enchantment.\nThe basic spell like [Fireball] or [Stone Wall] requires four rings to construct the formation and release the spell.\nThe first and outermost ring is the structure or, to say, the outline of the spell that the user wants to create according to their requirement, like how an architect draws the blue map of a building. If the building(spell) is complicated, the circle might increase.\nThe second ring is where the magician imbues mana to the spell. It's common sense to know that different kind of spells varies the requirement of mana. This part is crucial since if the imbalance of magic energy occurs, the user might face severe backlash.\nThe third and the most descriptive ring. Unlike the other two, this mana circle requires nothing but a sane mind. After getting an outline and mana as the material for construction, the third ring helps in giving the spell a definite shape.\nOne has to remember that if the spell doesn't get molded in a particular shape, the whole mana circle might obliterate at once.\nAnd the last and innermost ring. This work is done by users' senses as they target, where to utilize the spell and release it in accordance.\nThis is the essential procedure of conjuring that the magi needs to follow in order to extract their potential and invoke the art of spell.\n________.\n\"You all must have a great command on mana, right? Can anyone create a bird through flames?\"\nAustin asked the students who previously used to teach him as he leaned on the ledge of the blackboard.\nThe older ones glanced at each other before the brunette beauty, Emily, swirled her index finger and formed an aggressive Phoenix within half a second.\n\"Excellent professor. Now, I seize the liberty to assume that everyone present here, takes the same time to conjure something trivial like this?\"\nAustin glanced at each corner and significantly halted his gaze on the first princess, who nodded, albeit being a little flustered.\nReceiving the affirmation, Austin continued his lecture.\n\"Now, as I assume, Professor Emily must have just pictured the bird in her mind for almost a tenth of a second and created it using the blaze element, right?\"\nEmily did what Austin just stated, so she nodded without hesitation.\n\"Now, back on the track. Does everyone know what this ring does?\"\nPointing at the third ring drawn on the blackboard, Austin asked the students as everyone nodded affirmatively.\nTiara was also aware of the magic circles to a decent extent, so she also shook her head vertically.\n\"Unlike the other circles, this one takes a whole lot of time since magicians have to picture the shape and figure; they want their spell to blast out. But what if we erase this circle and let our subconscious do the spell molding as what Professor Emily did with the Phoenix? What if the most time-consuming ring gets prepared when we create the blue print, imbue the mana, and get ready to release it? Can you imagine what margin of time we can save like that?\"\nAudible gasps resonated in the classroom as various teachers looked at Austin like he just has chanted the worst curse in front of them.\nSome of the older professors, among the others, fell into deep contemplation upon hearing the theory syllable by syllable.\nIndeed it was confirmed that the third circle takes the most time, and skipping that laboring task would not only help the mage release the spell at a lesser time but also decrease some burden from them.\n\"I-Its absurd to even think something like that! A single mistake in a circle formation and the chanter would die using a mere fireball!\"\nOne of the white-bearded Professors of Potion Brewing spoke with a slight sneer as he completely disregarded the thesis that Austin presented.\n\"Well, you won't change until you keep on doing the same thing. If you don't risk your safety, then it's better to leave the class and do what you believe is right, no?\"\nMercilessly, Austin suggested the professor leave the class if he doesn't like what Austin was teaching. But the bearded one didn't even flinch from his position but only turned his head away.\n\"But how do we erase the circle but still cast the spell, Sir Austin?\"\nTiara raised her voice as she still was unclear about the long explanation Austin gave before the buzzing of professors started.\nBut it wasn't Austin who responded, but...\n\"By mastering, every spell one knows about...right?\"\n\"Absolutely correct, Professor Leone. You have to become proficient in the spell you know, so your mind creates a reflection of the spell in a corner of your memory. In that way, you can just replicate that piece of memory without needing to form it every single time.\"\nThe class fell into deep silence. As long the students kept on thinking about the hypothesis Austin provided, the more it started to seem plausible.\nAmidst the silence, suddenly, the door of the classroom swung open, much to Austin's annoyance since he liked the act of being a teacher.\nBut before he could have said anything, Austin's breath got choked as he saw the person standing there with a grim expression adorning her face.\n\"It's already four hours, Dear Professor Austin~ Are you planning to go all-nighter?\"\n____________________\nA/N: - She is just like that. Demanding and domineering. The next chapter would be fluffy.\nComment down to let me know whether the story is progressing alright.",

      "content": "After Luna's arrival, all the professors left the class wordlessly since they didn't want to get mingled in a lover's quarrel.\nAustin announced the next class would be after three days, so until then, all the students were given the task to at least master one spell and use it in the way Austin described in the class.\nIt was a tough job to accomplish, but in the end, no one complained and accepted the challenge with a bold front.\nNow in the classroom were left only three people. Two undoubtedly were the famous couple, Luna and Austin. And as for the third one...\n\"It's a pleasure to meet you, Luna-san.\"\nPinching the hem of her gown, Tiara elegantly bowed and greeted Humanity's greatest hope and the dear girlfriend of her professor~\nLuna also stood straight before returning the gesture.\n\"Likewise, Your Highness.\"\nAustin, who was just to the left of Luna, took the coat off the hanger before draping it over Luna's shoulder as he spoke in a concerned voice.\n\"Aren't you cold in that?\"\nTiara's eyes went round as she saw the considerate gesture from Austin. Even though her face was smiling, a very frightening thought emerged in her mind, which she probably would keep a hold on.\nOn the other side, Luna felt a smile blooming on her face but remembering that she was currently angry because of Austin, she held back herself.\n\"It's nice to have a man like Sir Austin as your lover, no?\"\nLuna's attention fell back on the princess as she heard her query, which genuinely didn't feel like Luna was getting asked. It seemed Tiara was stating the fact on which Luna couldn't agree more.\n\"Yes, it is. Even though he is a little careless at times and forgives people easily, he is a good person to have by my side.\"\nAustin smiled, being praised by the person he loves since her compliments were something he could never get tired of.\nMeekly he extended his hand and held hers. Luna tried to brush it away but soon conceded after seeing his innocent eyes.\n'This guy.... '\n\"Okay then, Princess. We would be heading off.\"\nSaying so, Austin bowed slightly before pulling Luna away from the room. Luna apologetically looked at Tiara for a second before following her persistent man.\nLeft alone in the cold dark room, Tiara thought about various things. There were numerous plans circulating in her mind, but amidst the chaos, a single drop of pearl-like tear dripped down her cheek as she gawked at the distancing back of the man she adores.\nHer legs gave away as she plopped down on the ground with a train of thoughts muddling her head.\n'Why does he smile like that for her, not me...Why you held her hand, not mine...Why we didn't meet earlier...Why do you love her, not me...Why it must be her...Why? Why? Why? Why? WHY?!'\n\"I...also...want...you\n_______________________\n\"I said I am sorry... \"\n\"Don't talk to me! You said we would have dinner together. Now it's already ten! \"\nLuna grumbled as she walked ahead of Austin, but still, their hands were connected with fingers intervened like an unbeatable bond.\nAustin promised her to conclude all his lessons by eight, and then after, they would have dinner in the cafeteria and spend the night without a talk of the outside world. Just him and her.\nBut professor Austin got so immense being a teacher that he ruined the first part of their date resulting in Luna's current mood.\nSeeing that regular persuasion wouldn't work on the current Saintess, Austin decided on the rougher option.\nAustin suddenly grabbed her wrist and pressed Luna on the corridor wall.\n\"Ah! \"\nLuna yelped slightly as she found herself caged in between the sturdy arms of the boy in front.\nWith his left-hand pressing Luna's wrist on the wall and the other one grabbing her back, Austin lowered his head and whispered his words.\n\"You know your angry face looks incredibly enchanting, right? Are you trying to seduce me? \"\nA blush heated her ears as she felt the hot breath hitting her face along with the robust arm holding her waist like he owns it, made Luna gulp in excitement.\nBut she couldn't accept her defeat now.\n\"You...and your sweet talking. \"\nTurning her head, Luna pouted, but the redness her cheeks getting dyed in, exposed her true feelings.\n\"You know what, Luna... \"\nBringing himself toward her, Austin almost pressed her against the wall, as her supple breast got mashed against him.\n\"I have decided my dinner... \"\nLuna's breathing became ragged as she lowered her gaze as Austin bit on her earlobe before chanting what he desired the most currently.\n\"I am going to eat you whole until you beg me to stop... \"\n(A/N: - R-18 on Patreon;)\n______________________\nThe next morning, Luna felt the warmth beside her distancing as she parted her lids slowly and let the slightly illuminated room get adjusted to her view. There was a peculiar smell in the air which made her brows frown as her daze finally got exhausted.\nThe first thing that came to her view was a lean yet sturdy back that had visible scratch marks, which she inflicted in the heat last night.\nExtending her hand, she healed Austin's back which made Austin aware that she had woken up.\n\"Sorry for disturbing you. \"\nAustin extinguished the fire serpent from the top of his index finger as he also threw the cigarette he had in his other hand.\n\"You again smoking that...I don't like its smell... \"\nIn a groggy voice, Luna complained before Austin took her in his arms and, while embracing her fondly, laid down on the bed.\n\"It just helps me think better.\"\nAustin was aware that the smell of smoke annoys Luna, so he always did it when she wasn't around, but early in the morning, a thought troubled him, which arose his urge to smoke a real quick one out.\n\"And what were you thinking? \"\nFeeling her favorite warmth all over her naked body, Luna became calm as she asked in a soft tone.\n\"About the labyrinth.\"\nLuna's drowsiness depleted in an instant as she heard about the place, which nearly freaked her out some days ago when she returned from Aurora.\nIt was the second time that Luna felt her mana being weakened to that extent, but unlike the demon artifact, the effect of Labyrinth was profoundly terrifying.\n\"It seems we have been ignoring something which would bite our back in the future... \"\n____________________\nA/N: - Austin has learned that the best defense is to attack that's why he has switched roles with Luna.\nAnyway, the next chapter would reveal some of the massive facts about the main arc of the story.\nThe novel is far from completion, but the beginning of it has already commenced.",

      "content": "\"How did you feel, Luna? Inside the labyrinth?\"\nBasking in the little sunlight peeking through the curtains, a couple consisting of an otherworldly silver-haired young girl and a handsome blond youth laid down on the bed while embracing each other.\nTheir naked body squeezed in an intimate space as Austin asked in the context of his previous concern.\nLuna thought for a second about the peculiar sensation she felt for the second time in her life. Straightening her posture, she rested the back of her head on Austin's arm before answering.\n\"It was a strange feeling. Unlike the demonic artifact which suppressed my life energy, the chills from the labyrinth made it seem that I never had something called mana inside of me. Like the connection from the actuality was getting severed inside that hole.\"\nAustin nodded as he also felt that the reach of mana became scarce in the depth of the labyrinth. It won't be weird to say that the wormhole built underneath the Academy was restricting mana entirely.\nIt was like a vacuum space.\nEven Austin had limited his mana; he could still feel the disability like a prominent limb had been snatched away from him.\nSince he believed Luna had a unique kind of mana, he wanted to hear her opinion on this, and strangely or not, the conclusion came out the same.\n\"Might be some kind of divine artifact again?\"\nLuna sensed Austin's uneasiness since he gets bothered by something he isn't completely aware of. She was also troubled by the peculiarity of the labyrinth, but she didn't pay much mind until Austin brought it up.\n\"Might be, but I think there's something more to it.\"\nAustin whispered in a profound manner before he took something out of his inventory.\nBy outer appearance, it seemed a pouch that carried some fluid as Austin brought it closer to Luna before asking.\n\"Can you assess this?\"\nWith a perplexed frown, Luna looked at the pouch before nodding as her eyes shined with a cyan hue as she appraised the thing inside within ten seconds.\n\"Grade 'S' venom, which might put sleep to this whole school if another of those pouches gets mixed in the next meal. Highly resistant to Holy Magic and belongs to a serpent which I have never assessed until now. Other than these, the most concerning fact is that the venom doesn't contain an ounce of mana.\"\nAustin nodded and gave an admirable smile to Luna, making the latter shy away. Putting the bag inside the inventory, Austin arranged the strands of her beautiful hair before tucking them back of her ear, as he further commented.\n\"That's what I thought. The creature that I battled in the labyrinth, wasn't utilizing mana and was just relying on its physical characterization. It was the first time I faced someone without essence or curse energy yet so decently powerful.\"\nVenom, despite being lethal, couldn't harm superhumans like Austin until mana isn't injected into it. But here, the thing which came out of the serpent queen was dangerous even to Mana-wielding humans, despite being completely natural.\n\"How can such a being doesn't have magical essence in them? And even if they had, I guess that environment in the labyrinth would become their deathbed.\"\nLuna muttered under her breath, which Austin was also thinking, but soon he brushed the matter off as he calmed Luna's growing curiosity.\n\"Well, we won't find answers until we dwell inside the abyss. And for that, we have to make various preparation so halt those thoughts for now.\"\nSaying so, Austin turned toward Luna before hugging her fondly in his embrace. Luna also didn't hold back in snuggling close as she smiled in delight.\nBut soon, her eyes parted before she narrowed her gaze toward the man as she asked in a suspicious tone.\n\"Austin~What's this hot thing sticking to my belly?\"\nAustin grinned as he replied, \"Why don't you appraise it too?\"\n___________________\n\"Why are you guys so late even though we talked about eating breakfast together? Now it's already mid-noon.\"\nInside the semi-crowded cafeteria of the Eden Academy grumbled a charming raven-haired woman as she chewed on her prawn salad.\n\"Ask your brother. He didn't learn the word restrain, I think.\"\nLuna also grumbled as she felt the stings on her neck which, despite getting healed, gave a burning sensation. Not to talk about her butt.\nAustin, on the other side, had an apologetic smile on his face as he passed mixed herb soup to his lover and got up to get a lot of sweets to fix her mood.\nSaya wasn't a child to not understand what could have made these two's arrival delay. But there wasn't anything she could do other than lower her gaze and accept the reality.\nLuna's eyes observed the troubled storms inside Saya's mind as she asked in a bland tone.\n\"Don't tell you've already given up, dear Imouto-chan~.\"\nSaya didn't have the mood to retort the teasing as she continued eating her salad which started to seem a little tasteless now.\n\"Will it even make any difference? Onii-sama would never look at me as a woman.\"\nSaid in a defeated tone was the girl who had almost lost hope in making her brother see her in a different light. Whatever she tried resulted in nothing.\n\"Well, you didn't approach him properly.\"\nHearing Luna's remark, Saya narrowed her gaze before she asked in a heavy voice.\n\"And what is that?\"\n\"Lean your head forward.\"\nDespite being baffled, Saya did as Luna asked before she started whispering something which Saya had never expected to hear from her.\n**WHISPER**WHISPER**\n\"A-are you serious about that?!\"\nWith wide-eyed, Saya asked after she listened to every detail Luna gave her.\n\"Of course, it would. I know your brother the best in those departments, after all.\"\nLuna confidently announced as she resumed her soup while she waited for the treat Austin had gone to get for her.\nSaya remained silent for several seconds before a natural query came out of her lips.\n\"Why are you helping me seduce Onii-sama when you love him so much? Won't you fear that I might snatch him away?\"\nLuna answered in a way that it seemed she anticipated such a question.\n\"I just pity you. I wasn't with Austin for long before we became a couple, and you spent years with him yet failed even to make him see you as a potential love interest. And about that snatching away part. You might get some of his love, but at the end of the day, I will always remain his first woman, dear Imouto-chan~.\"\nAll of her words were spoken with utter confidence, like she believed Austin's favorability on her more than anything. Saya was astonished for a second before she smirked.\n\"Well, don't blame me if I become his second favorite.\"\n\"What are you guys chatting about? Here it's yours, Saya. And the rest belongs to Luna.\"\nAustin appeared all of a sudden as he placed a plate of Apple pie in front of his sister and half a dozen of different desserts for his angered lover.\nJust as he put down the last plate, he sensed something approaching him before he twirled on his toe and caught the little thing in his grip.\nLoosening his hold, Austin found it was a mana mail as the two women asked almost in unison.\n\"\"Who is it from? \"\"\nAustin's eyes were solemn with a little spark hidden behind his emerald gems as he whispered under his breath.\n\"Mother....\"\n____________________\nA/N: - Yay!\nWe reached a century of chapters.\nThanks for all those who have been reading my story and will come across in future.\nThis is my first novel in which I have came this far.\nIt's all thanks to those who always support me and help me to keep moving forward.\nLove you, guys❤️\nI hope we can share this relationship for a little longer until we don't reach the end of this journey.\nAnyway, thanks a lot and please do drop a comment ~",

      "content": "[Sophia Wright POV:]\n(A/N: - Austin's mother)\nBeing a biased mother was never in my plan since I learned what the terms marriage and children meant.\nI come from a high noble family where we get educated about everything related to the man we would be marrying, or how we should raise our child.\nWhen I got betrothed to my husband, Vincent Wright, I vowed to do my all to support this man in whichever means I could and do my best to raise our child to become a responsible pillar of the Count family.\nDespite being less expressive about his feelings, I know Vincent loves me dearly, which fulfilled my life.\nWithin a year, the fruit of our love resulted in a baby, making our already happy life even more joyful. It might be one of the most touching moments when I felt my baby inside me.\nFortunately, without any massive trouble in our life, nine months passed and I delivered our firstborn. It was really a memorable day for Vincent and me as we saw the little baby lying cozily in his father's embrace.\nOur little Austin.\nBut even before I could have adequately held my child for the first time in my arms, a prophecy was bestowed that snatched our happiness at once.\nI still couldn't remember the accurate words, but the voice told: one day, this child would become the entity who would stand alone from all—the one who would accept the world as his enemy.\nI was devasted to the very end of my soul. It felt like the perfect picture I had imagined was tainted.\nWe didn't lose hope there and called for the pope from the capital. From what he said, it seemed Austin indeed had a dark future that would lead him to complete solitary.\nWe jumped from Saint to fortune tellers, but the conclusion was the same. Austin was a cursed child.\nWhen I felt that every route was getting blocked, Vincent proposed an idea that I still couldn't believe I had heard from him.\n'Shouldn't we just get rid of the future threat until we have the time... '\nI still remember that day when the man I thought to be the kindest person out there said such cruel words, which made my heart shatter into pieces.\nWe had a huge argument that day, but I somehow convinced Vincent that no matter how much of a monster he thought of my Austin, he still was our child.\nI suggested that we would treat him indifferently, so he could naturally leave the name of Wright. It was a tough decision for me, but getting my child slaughtered would be the last thing I wanted.\nThat little thing hadn't even opened his eyes, and here his own father was about to put an end to him. That day, I first time regretted my marriage to Vincent.\nSoon Vincent decided to have another child since it would help to carry the liege without having the chance to let Austin get involved in throne succession.\nI accepted all of it. I just wanted my little Austin to live.\nEven I could never tell my son how much his mother cares for him. Even I could never embrace my child and give him the warmth he deserves. Even though I could never enjoy his achievement or share his grief, it was okay.\nUntil Austin lived, I was ready to accept anything.\nI gave him my family's heirloom in the name of a parting gift; even Vincent didn't want me to meet Austin. But how could I have restricted myself?\nI knew Austin might lose his life in the fight with Captain Charles, so my meeting with him became even more necessary.\nNo one knew about the moonstone I gave Austin since it would have created an unwanted hassle.\nThe image of Austin's hopeful eyes before the battle is still vivid in my memory. Even though he has grown up all noble and handsome, I still saw that little Austin in him, who used to crawl all around the house at the age of only seven months.\nThat day, I cried over and over again after returning mansion. I was glad and proud that Austin not only survived the battle but also gave almost defeat to Captain Charles.\nBut that feeling of pride wasn't able to suppress the grief I felt after seeing that expectant gaze my son directed at me. His beautiful eyes, which held the wish to talk to me even for an extra second, made my heart clench.\nI am his mother, for God's Sake!!\nYet... I... I...\n\"Madame? What happened?!\"\n\"Ah...\"\nSuddenly I heard the call of my maid as she moved toward me before wiping my cheeks with a soft cloth.\nIt seemed I still wasn't able to suppress my emotions completely.\n\"My lady, are you missing Master Austin?\"\nMy handmaid, Sufi, who came from my old house, knows everything about the things I have gone through. Other than my assistance, she serves me as a true friend too.\nShe is the only person who calls Austin in such a respectful manner since she also has seen how unfortunate that child's life has been.\n\"Well, even though I wear the facade of an uncaring woman, this heart still seeks the child who called me Mama for the first time.\"\nA smile curved on my lips as I remembered the day Austin spoke for the first time when he was only a year old.\nSuch a brilliant child.\n\"Ah, my lady...that letter?\"\nLooking at the desk, I realized that I subconsciously had sent the letter while I reminisced about Austin.\nA look of horror spread like a sheet as I thought, what could I have written on that letter?\n'I hope I didn't mention something shameless.....'\n____________________\n\"What is it written inside, Austin?\"\nWith a perplexed gaze, Luna asked as she tried to peek into the letter that Austin received some seconds ago from his mother.\nBut before she could have caught a glimpse, Austin folded the paper back as he looked at the two with a delightful smile, much to Luna's curiosity.\n\"What happened, Nii-sama?\"\nEven Saya had a little idea about Austin's parents in this life; she could see how happy her brother was after receiving the letter, which made her smile too.\nAfter a slight pause, he spoke in a cheery tone.\n\"I might be gone for some days.\"\n_____________________\nA/N: - Some drama. Some tears. Some relevance. Let's see where this goes~",

      "content": "Inside a classroom sat numerous adults, along with a pretty princess currently adorning with a beautiful smile across her face.\nThis class was under the supervision of none other than the infamous noble Austin, who had been teaching the teachers about Conjuring for the past ten days or so.\nVarious professors, along with the brilliant mage, Tiara, had gotten a hold of the passage of chanting a spell in a much lesser time, as for what Austin explained.\nIt was a slow start since the theory was entirely foreign to the old-timers, but it was their experience that helped the professors to learn the absurd way of casting a spell.\nThe class of Conjurors went in a three-cycle period. First was the explanation. Austin clarified the theory of how to erase the third circle of different kinds of spells. Not everyone uses the same element, so the idea needs to be altered. Therefore this stage contains the most significance.\nThe second step was to practice what they had been taught. One could only become a bookworm if the theoretical knowledge isn't implicated in real life. Mana manipulation, along with mind training through meditation and whatnot, is processed in the second stage.\nThe third stage was to show the results that Austin asks for in the next class. Everyone was tasked to at least master one spell in two days. Once a person gets a hold of how to erase a circle yet accomplish the spell, it becomes a lot easier to do it repeatedly.\nThings were going smoothly from the other two sides, too.\nLuna was teaching the lot in her own way, which was bringing out results, albeit a little slower than Conjurors. Well, it was understandable since Luna was teaching amateur teenagers.\nHer patience in coping with such worthless students was also a miracle in itself. If not for Austin's coaxing and fawning all night, she might have left the job on the second day.\nThe last class of physical training was under the control of Saya. She was doing a remarkable job tutoring the maggots on how they should be wielding steel.\nAt the start, she was pretty harsh, to the point even Kyouki was sent to the infirmary in one of those trials. But with time, as Austin persuaded her, Saya began to understand how she should be teaching.\nNow back to the present...\nUnder the curious gaze of the students who entered inside the classroom was the headmaster Merlin?\nA wave of shock flew throughout the room as they were expecting someone younger than the Principal.\nTiara anxiously stood up before asking what others were thinking too.\n\"Merlin-sama...is Sir Austin not going to provide his lecture today?\"\nMerlin sighed as he saw the impatience from the girl and almost everyone in the room, signifying how unwelcomed the Grandmaster was.\nIn so less time, many of the students and professors have become a fan of Austin's way of teaching. This reaction was the reason for such favorability.\nPositioning in the center of the aisle, the bearded wizard stomped his staff to gather the attention and halt the chattering, as he spoke in a neutral tone.\n\"Austin wouldn't be available for a few days due to his personal issues, so until then, I will be teaching you all.\"\nThe class became a little noisier as some of them even sighed in shame or 'Tch*ed', bringing a thick bulge on the headmaster's forehead.\nWith a twitching smile, an ominous idea emerged in his mind in regard to today's class.\n'It seems I have to show them, why I still hold the title of Grandmaster... '\n___________________\nIn a faraway land, almost a thousand miles away from the Eden Academy, could be seen a luxurious carriage currently steadily trodding through the bustly market.\nThe way people were giving space for the carriage made it clear what social status the people inside carried.\nThis market, this town, and various places are somewhat engraved in Austin's memory since he has wandered these streets all his childhood.\nYes, this was the piece of land under the administration of Count Vincent Wright, Heideith.\nCurrently, inside the carriage, the highest nobility of the town, Countess Sophia, along with her daughter Eleanor, were going to shop in the local complex.\nIt wasn't a rare occasion for the duo to go out shopping, but the crowd still treated the carriage like the Emperor of Gram himself had arrived.\nUnlike in the past, there wasn't any security carriage following the Royal transport since it seemed the guards got muddled in the crowd.\n\"Your father would get angry if he heard about this, Eli.\"\nSophia scolded her daughter lightly as it was Eleanor who pleaded to leave the guard carriage behind so they could rush toward Eleanor's favorite tea shop.\n\"Mou~ How can I help mother? That aromatic tea arrives once a month, and the tea owner also doesn't give patronage to nobles. Rushing is the only option left.\"\nSophia sighed with a smile as this side of her daughter seemed incredibly adorable, unlike most of the time when Eleanor, stays severe and determined for her future.\nWith her eyes focused on the outside, Eleanor enjoyed the scene as her platinum blond hair which had a radiance just like her mother, swayed freely in the air.\nAmidst her enjoyment, a strange feeling emerged inside her, as her brows grew narrower.\n\"Hey mom....isn't the market growing a lot crowdy, yet we aren't halting at all?\"\nSophia, who was reading one of her books, suddenly heard her daughter's voice before she looked outside.\nA severe frown also clouded her charming face as, indeed, the market was getting populated like there was some kind of festival celebration, yet the wheels were rolling like it was passing through them.\n'Something is fishy... '\n\"Dolton, stop the carriage.\"\nCalling out the coachman, Sophia seemed to be a little hurried as her heart grew suspicious severly.\nBut against her command, the carriage kept moving as it had been under a spell.\nSpell...?\nSophia's eyes went wide as she moved to the little window at the front of the cabin before sliding it apart.\nTwirling her finger, a small water orb formed on top of her index before she launched at the man she had called Dolton earlier.\nMuch to her horror, the water sphere passed through the man before a cloud of smoke emerged out of nowhere and engulfed the whole cabin.\n\"Mom!\"\n____________________\nA/N: - This is going to be dramatic. But I am lovin it!\nAh, yes. I am going to start an alternative to the story on Patreon. Well, I have thought to.\nSo if you want to ride a different kind of coaster with the same characters and Austin having a harem(evil laugh), do check my Patreon.\n/Svneighter\n.gg/cvKBKV3u3e\nP. S-\nI am writing Austin as harem protag in patron Alternative Side Stories, that doesn't mean the main canon couldn't go harem. As I said I am uncertain where this will go so don't worry harem lovers. ;)",

      "content": "'Mm... '\nWith a severe frown, Sophia's eyes trembled before she parted her lids after who knows how long.\nThe last thing she remembers is when the carriage got ambushed by a strange kind of spell. Since the occurrence took place soon after Sophia discovered the illusionary spell of the coachman, she wasn't able to counter what came at them.\nThe first thing her vision searched just upon stabilizing was her daughter, Eleanor. Fortunately, she didn't have to look around since she could sense her daughter was tied to her back.\n\"Eli, are you alright?\"\nTrying to measure the strength of the rope, Sophia tried to twist her wrist, but it was utterly unmovable, which told how brilliantly sealing magic was applied.\n\"Yes, mom. What about you.\"\nEleanor's voice, just like her mother was extremely low, as she asked in concern. It might be the first time for Eleanor and Sophia to face something like this, but that doesn't mean they weren't prepared.\n\"Can you use your dagger here?\"\nKnowing her daughter's attributes with weapon manipulation, Sophia thought it might be the best course of action at the moment. But as she expected, the kidnappers weren't amateurs at all.\n\"They have taken it away. Even my pendant.\"\nEleanor gritted her teeth as she realized how thorough the abductors had kept them tied up. Very few people could notice how her pendant could be used as a weapon, but it seemed her ace card was already blown up.\nSophia sighed as she felt the agitation from her daughter before she cast a spell underneath their feet.\nThe spell formation only took ten seconds before two puddles of water formed in front of both ladies.\n\"Eli. Break the nail on my index finger and throw it in the puddle.\"\nEleanor wasn't sure why her mom said such a thing, but in this situation, she wasn't an idiot to ask for the reason.\nBreaking the nail, Eleanor flicked her thumb as it flew inside the puddle before the light blue shade into radiant purple.\nThe same happened on the other side as Sophia also mixed her nail, which was coated with a special kind of venom, into the pure aqua, making it a lethal consumer.\nThanks to the surrounding, which was covered with heavy smog, the movement of puddles didn't alert the criminals.\n\"They look like slime.\"\nEleanor made a disgusted face as the little things climbed her body before they moved toward the back of their hand. The slimy feeling of something sucking on her wrist was irresistible, but Eleanor somehow held herself together.\n\"What fruit such handwork would bear, My lady Countess Sophia Wright?\"\nSuddenly much to both blond beauties' shock, the heavy cloud dispersed before a silhouette appeared out of nowhere.\nThe man, who by outer appearance looked in his late twenties, walked steadily toward them. His violet hair was neatly combed on the back with a formal three-piece suit adorning his lean stature.\nSophia's eyes went wide as she saw the person.\n\"S-Sabes?\"\nEleanor frowned as she realized that her mother was aware of the man's identity as she surveyed the surrounding. As the smoke disappeared, Eleanor was able to feel multiple presences around.\n\"You do remember me, my lady? I am honored.\"\n'Remember you, huh... '\nHow could she forget about her childhood friend who used to play at her parent's house? He was Sophia's best friend, and being the son of Gardner; he always had to chance to be with her.\nThey grew up together while being on good terms, but suddenly, at the time of her marriage, Sabes disappeared like a ghost.\nSophia wasn't a child to not know the reason why he left. But apart from friendship, Sophia didn't find anything in Sabes.\nNaturally, she didn't tell about this to anyone, and after marriage, she nearly forgot about him. Until today...\n\"Why are you here? What do you want?\"\nSophia could sense a strange kind of mana presence from Sabes, which gave ominous vibes. And coupled with the fact that her magical energy seemed to be suppressed under his watch, made her terrified.\n\"Before I tell you what I want, let me tell you something I have already done.\"\nSophia gulped in nervousness, but her facial expression was as stern as ever. On the other side, Eleanor felt incredibly uncomfortable because of this foreign sensation blocking her mana channels.\n\"Your son, Benjamin Wright. Right now, he is getting sword training from an instructor called Collon. You know, that instructor can anytime stab the sword at your son when he is vulnerable the most?\"\nBoth women widened their eyes as they heard about the person they had a close relationship with. But little did they think that there was more to reveal.\n\"Your husband, Vincent Wright. Currently, he is in office, signing a bundle of documents. He may ask for a coffee, and what if one of the maids, blends some kind of drug in that coffee? He sure has strong resistance, but is he immune to everything?\"\nAs his words concluded, Sabes was already some feet apart from Sophia. Despite holding her stance, one could see how profoundly it was getting tough for her not to fall on the ground.\nBut Eleanor didn't have that much resistance as she fell on her knees while panting like her life force had been sucked out.\nLooking at the man whom she once called her dearest friend with hatred and aggression, Sophia heard what didn't surprise her at all.\n\"Now, what I want is simple.\"\nWalking some steps, he lowered his head before whispering in her ears.\n\"I want you to be mine, my lady.\"\nSophia closed her eyes as a heavy pearl-like tear dripped down her cheeks. All her weak nerves are under Sabes hold. Her daughter is struggling to survive just some inches apart from her. All the possible routes seemed to be blocked by a single person.\nBut just as an unimaginable resort emerged in her mind, a voice that seemed utterly familiar echoed in her senses, giving her a jolt of hope.\n\"It's been a while, mother...\"\n____________________\nAt the same time, in an extravagantly decorated room could be seen two figures adorning contradictory demeanors currently.\nThe handsome boy in his early twenties was undoubtedly aggrieved because of something as he threw stuffs here and there.\n**PNNNG**\nThe last piece of decor, was an expensive flower pot that was thrown to the ground before it shattered into pieces. Not able to find anything, the person turned toward the other one inside the room.\nThe other one was a girl in her teens with pretty blond long hair as she sipped on her tea elegantly while sighing at her brother's tantrum along the way.\n\"Are you done?\"\nThe man snickered as he replied in a disdainful voice.\n\"Why do you care? I am dying to even catch a glimpse of her, and here you are getting your time with that bas-\"\n\"Big Brother Cain~.\"\nThe mouth of the first prince wasn't able to conclude the curse he was about to throw at Austin as Tiara released a heavy amount of killing intent toward her brother.\nA drop of sweat dripped down his head as he plopped down on the couch under the fret of offending his sister.\nTiara sighed again before pulling back her intent. She really can't hold herself when someone disrespects her professor.\n\"Okay, listen. Tomorrow night, I will do the preparation. Take 'that' thing and go for your Saintess when the time is right, okay?\"\nHearing his sister, Cain felt a little perplexed but soon, a big grin formed across Cain's lips as he finally got the consent to use 'that' and a chance to claim what he desired the most.\n'Finally, I can hold you once again... '\n____________________\nA/N: - Remind me if I have mentioned the first prince's name before. Things will be chaotic on either end, but nothing unspeakable will happen.\nSo drop a like if you are hyped~",

What an honor to meet such an entity in person.\"\nSabes turned toward the blond boy who was walking up to them with his eyes hollow as a black hole with his gaze remained only on the woman.\nCompletely disregarding the man, Austin stood before Sophia as he brought his hand toward her cheek before collecting the pearl-like tear on the side of his index.\nSophia was utterly astonished by so many developments, along with the fear she had felt some moments ago, which left her speechless.\nAt that moment, she had forgotten all the facade she had maintained in front of her firstborn as she raised her hand and pinched Austin's sleeve while shedding more and more tears.\n**SWIISH**\nA profound amount of intent rose and covered Austin, making him look wrapped in flames of radiant shades.\nKeeping his mother and sister in a safe space, Austin let loose of his aura, which made the violet-haired man tremble in a fret as he fell on his butt because of such coercive intent he felt for the first time.\nThe feeling of death just from someone's aura was something Sabes had felt for the first time. His forehead was drenched in sweat while he retreated slightly back with his eyes wide, staring at the back of the unexpected appearance.\n'I-Is he re-really a human anymore... '\nOn the other side, Sophia tucked Austin's sleeve a little stiffly as she realized Sabes condition. Austin knew what it was about, as he sighed with a smile.\nTaking her hand, he spoke gently to soothe her mother.\n\"Don't worry; I have taken care of Sir Vincent and Benjamin.\"\nSophia felt relieved hearing about the safety of her beloveds, but the way Austin called his father made her a little sad as she looked at him in disapproval.\nAustin swept his glance away before turning toward the person on the ground.\n\"I will be back.\"\nSaying so, Austin released Sophia's hand before he started walking toward Sabes with heavy steps. The look in his eyes was completely different compared to how he looked at his family.\nSabes shivered all over as he communicated with his troops waiting on the sidelines if something like this occurred.\nBut as soon he tried to connect with them, a blank response came in return, throwing Sabes into despair.\nHis eyes trembled as he realized that not only a mere teenager had breached his illusionary barrier, but also, all the elite soldiers he had trained to take part in this single job had been slaughtered without Sabes noticing.\n\"This can't be...\"\nHis belief in actuality has been fading since Austin arrived, but the feeling of death nearing his throat helped Sabes to escape his stupor as he released a mind manipulation attack on Austin.\n[Enslave]\nAustin swatted the incoming spell away like a fly, much to Sophia's disbelief. It was indeed astonishing to see Austin playing with such high-grade magic like it meant nothing to him.\nSabes had a much uglier expression as, while gritting his teeth, he cast his second spell.\n[Mana Bind]\nA set of purple chains augmented around Austin before restraining his movement but only just for a second...\n**CLICK**\nWith a slight jerk of their body, Austin broke free before his body disappeared from the site into thin air.\n\"Earlier, I heard you were giving choices to my mother?\"\nSabes eyes contracted until they reached the thinnest similar to a needle, as he heard the bone-chilling voice just inches apart from him.\nTurning his head stiffly, while trembling all over, Sabes was met with a pair of emeralds looking inside his very existence, as Sabes heard the boy...no the monster speaking again.\n\"Let me give you some options too. First, you run away right now; then I will blow your father's workshop, where he is working diligently, and shred your friends while they are chugging in your hang-out places.\"\n\"The second option is to go and rub your head in front of my mother before I give you a slightly less painful death. Oh yeah, the first option does contain your death, albeit after you lose your loved ones.\"\nFrom start to end, Austin's voice remained emotionless and stoic as ever, like he was chanting a mantra.\nThe expression on Sabes face changed significantly when the people he only cares for in life were mentioned by the boy he never planned to meet today.\nIt might be just bogus, but Austin was right about the places where his father and friends could be at this hour.\n\"Y-You can't kill innocent people! Sophia's child couldn't be such a person!\"\nSabes tried to reason about the falsery of Austin's threat. But little did he think Austin wouldn't be like the other two children of his parents.\n\"Look into my eyes, Sabes. Do you believe I would hesitate a second before ending anyone's life, regardless innocent or not?\"\nSabes gaze involuntarily fell on those bottomless orbs, which were too deep and lifeless that made the older one shiver uncontrollably before his eyes turned white, and with a bit of foam gushing out his mouth, he fell unconscious.\nAustin shook his head in disappointment as a whisper left his lips.\n\"Guess, you weren't ready for your own medicine, eh.\"\nHoping on his toes, Austin walked back to his mother's side, who was looking at the scene until now in utter disbelief and slight pride?\nAlong the way, he received the notification of something he was expecting.\n[Ding!]\n[Second Quest]\n[Save the Members of Wright's family]\n[Status: - Complete]\n[Reward: - 300 Villain's Point\nA set of Dragger and Cloak(A)]\n...\nYes, the reason why Austin was able to save the two men of the Wright family was the system's quest which gave not only their location but also information about the impostors.\nAustin had no idea why the system suddenly turned out like this. First Sicily, and now his ex-family was put up on the quest bar. In either case, he would have helped because of two different reasons but the System providing such a generous reward made him baffled.\nWell, he wasn't going to reject tho. ..\n\"Are you okay, mother?\"\nAustin checked all over, but apart from the rope marks on her wrist and slightly shaken-up emotions, she was fine. And same goes for Eleanor, who was lying unconscious on the ground.\n\"They are really safe, right?\"\nSophia asked while glancing at fallen Sabes as she heard the affirming voice of Austin.\n\"Have I ever lied to you?\"\nSophia's pure eyes blinked several times as she looked at her son, who had grown a little taller than her. She now has to lean her head to look at him.\nFinding the warming gaze filling in those eyes, Sophia felt she might lose the left-over fake front. She instantly turned her eyes away.\n\"Why did you call me here, mother?\"\n\"I never called you? Why do I even call such a child whom I don't have a relation with?\"\nAustin smirked as he heard the not-so-believable harsh words of his dear mother before he took out something from his inventory.\n\"Then why did you write this letter saying: Mama misses you, Aussie~ Please come back to me. Mama wants to see-\"\n\"Don't read anymore!\"\nSophia tried to snatch the letter away from Austin with her face completely dyed red. But the little minx of son wasn't kind enough to let her erase the piece of embarrassment.\n\"Will mother talk truthfully now?\"\nAustin asked with a big grin as he received a complaining pout from the mature one. Finally, after grumbling for some seconds, Sophia spoke in a meek tone.\n\"Fine...but don't dare repeat that letter again! Do you understand!?\"\n\"Hai... Hai... I promise I won't, mama~.\"\n_____________________\nA/N: - Drop a comment~",

      "content": "Emperor William, who has a judicial range on the whole continent of Gram, has four children from two of his wife.\nThe first Empress of the nation, Irene, has two children with her husband. The eldest prince Cain and the eldest princess Tiara.\nThe second wife of William, Tasha, gave birth to the successor of the throne, Mikhail, and the youngest of the family, Princess Catherine.\nExcept for Tiara, the other three don't get along with each other or say; Tiara is the only one who interacts with her brothers and sister more often.\nDespite being siblings, Catherine and Mikhail also doesn't share a close bond due to some reason. But since the latter had hefty jobs to handle already, he couldn't sit and ask his sister what had gone wrong.\nThere was a reason why Mikhail, despite not being officially announced, was still called the prime successor of the throne, even though there was a competent and worthy first born too.\nMikhail undoubtedly was a worthy warrior who had proficiency in Elemental Magic, and coupled with his wits and sense of justice, he became a proper subject for the next Monarch.\nBut Cain also had the same qualities. Although he was weak with mana, he still had a lot of potential in the arsenal. Then why he wasn't considered next to the throne?\nThe reason is Cain's vulnerability to manipulation.\nFrom very thorough observation, it has been conceded that Prince Cain's judgment can be influenced if the influencer is slightly good with their words.\nThe First Empress did try to get his son educated about such weakness, but all futile. He is just too easy to fool. He quickly trusts someone as their ally and might consider a friend a foe if convinced.\nThe choice became clearer with Mikhail's day-by-day achievements in different fields and the stupidity Cain introduced.\nOne of those deeds he did, in someone else's words, was to pursue a woman with whom Cain never belonged to.\nWithout him knowing, his sister Tiara had been manipulating him for a very long time, and tonight, too, she has molded his anger and given him free rein to get together with the Saintess of Humanity, Luna.\nIt was around eight in the evening when Luna returned to Austin's room. Since her dorm was given to Saya, she has practically started cohabitation with Austin. Even though he wasn't present today, she had other ways to cover herself in his presence.\nStrolling lazily through the garden, Luna suddenly felt someone approaching before a voice called out for her.\n\"It's been a long, Luna-san.\"\nThe voice was unfamiliar but not the face. Luna did have to ponder a little, but soon she recognized who the person in front was.\n\"Greetings, Your Highness.\"\nLuna bowed a little while lifting the hem of her skirt as she greeted the first prince of Gram.\nCain's heart fluttered violently upon seeing Luna from this close after a long time. He instantly felt the urge to walk forward and hug the beauty who had made such a mess of his heart, but he held himself for now.\n\"You have become gorgeous, Luna. Even more from the last time, I saw you.\"\nLuna didn't recall when she met him last, so she just smiled in gratitude. She wanted to end this conversation and run back to Austin's dorm, where his manly scent awaited her.\nBut...\n\"Would you care to join me for a cup of tea? You see, I came here to meet Tia, and I don't feel like traveling in a carriage late at night. So I thought, why don't we have a chat when we get the opportunity?\"\nCain had some resorts prepared in case Luna rejected his invitation, which he was expecting more as an outcome. However, it seemed Luna also was interested in talking with Cain.\nWith a bright smile, Luna didn't contemplate for long before responding.\n\"I will be delighted to.\"\n_______...\nThe two of them moved toward the reception hall built on the western side of the main building. Since it was close, they, or rather Cain, chose the place.\nOn the way, neither of them spoke because of their own reasons.\nCain was incredibly elated, but the anxiety was blended in his feelings as he tried to suppress his grin and escorted Luna toward their destination\nThe reason why Luna was silent....was rather complicated to define.\nThe guards at the reception hall entrance immediately became alert as they greeted the royal highness in unison.\n\"\"We pay our greetings to the Royal Highness, Prince Cain-sama! \"\n\"Hmm. \"\nCain didn't bat an eye at the guards before he walked toward the door, which parted from the inside upon his arrival. If observed closely, one could see how hurried he was to invite her inside.\nWithout hesitation, Luna walked just some steps behind the prince as she also entered the hall solemnly.\nHowever, just after the doors closed on her back, an ominous feeling made her heart numb as a chilling sensation ran through her spine.\nHer facial expression was indifferent until now, contoured in anxiety and perplexion as she felt a familiar sensation weighing down her existence.\nLooking at Cain's back, Luna heard him saying something which made it clear who was behind all this.\n\"I apologize for doing this, Luna but... \"\nWith a big grin that showed his inner desires, Cain turned toward the panting Luna as he marveled at such a sight before speaking in an excited tone.\n\"....I can't hold myself any longer.\"\n___________________\nA/N: - Sorry for the short chapter. I will compensate in the next one.\nDrop a comment~",

      "content": "[Half an hour ago]\n\"Why did you give this to me, mother?\"\nAfter the thing with Sabes was handled, Austin picked Eleanor up and escorted his mother to a nearby shelter which h was devoid of the populace.\nIt seemed Sabes didn't carry this abduction in a spur. The place he directed Sophia and Eleanor through the carriage was far from the main town, near the eastern border.\nThe civilization around the region has long left the area since the other side of the border is covered with a high density of monstrosities and Dungeon Lairs.\nEleanor was still in a state of comma since it seemed Sabes's mana was far from what she could handle now, which genuinely made Sophia pitiful toward her daughter but proud to see how strong her son had become in so less time.\nIf before Austin seemed like a bright light for her, now he depicted the sun itself. Not only has his appearance changed, but also his strength and prowess.\n\"Mother?\"\n\"Uh?\"\nIt seemed Sophia, after seeing her son after so long, fell into a stupor before Austin pulled her back by shaking her shoulder lightly.\nLooking down at his hand, she could see the same pendant she had given him before his contest with Captain Charles.\n\"You haven't worn it yet.\"\nSophia whispered as she felt her son might have suspected her gift; that's why the locket was in hand, not attached to his neck.\nBut Austin's following words made her realize her misconception.\n\"I didn't tie it since I know the runes on it would attach to my very soul. But before I do that, I wanted to ask mother....whether it's okay for me to have such a valuable thing?\"\nMoonstone, as per what Luna informed him before, grants the wearer a second chance in life. It can resurrect the holder once after their death, by whatever means the user reaches their end.\nThe pendant undoubtedly was a priceless asset that the Emperor of Gram himself would pay fortunes to buy, and also, there was Vincent Wright too, whom should Sophia might want to grant this stone.\nAustin was ready to hand over the moonstone since he knew his mother gave it because of her fear of Austin's death in the brawl with Charles. And now that the match has been settled, it might be better if he returns the stone.\n'Well, it's my fault why he thinks this way... '\nSophia didn't lift her gaze to see Austin. Instead, she tucked his sleeve while she sat with her face leaned down.\n\"Austin, can you kneel?\"\nAustin blinked in perplexion before he did what she asked.\nBut as soon his gaze fell on his mother's eyes, his heart felt warm in an instant.\nThose eyes he only has seen being directed at his siblings, not him. The gaze which he always sought yet never attained. This sensation, which makes him delighted yet scared that what if it's all a dream?\nIt seemed ages for Sophia to look at her son without wearing a mask of hatred. She had forgotten when the last time she held her son's hand or saw his precious self.\nCaressing his tender cheeks, Sophia's eyes became moist as, with a smiling face, she spoke in a gentle tone.\n\"Do you think anything is more valuable than my son's life?\"\nHer soothing voice, which calmed Austin's long-built anxiety, was only audible to him at the moment. He might be an orphan in his later life, but hearing such a thing and feeling the warmth of the woman in front, he could confidently say he does have a person he could call his family.\nWithout him knowing, a droplet of tears slid down his cheek as he stared into her eyes and prayed this moment for last as long as possible.\n\"Give me that.\"\nSophia asked for the moonstone, which Austin handed without a second thought.\nCircling the thread around Austin's lean neck, Sophia whispered her honest thoughts, which she never could tell him before.\n\"I know I haven't been a good mother until now, but remember this, Austin.\"\nHooking the knot on his back, a silver illumination sparkled near Austin's upper chest, which he didn't mind and only heard his mother's words.\n\"I love you as much I love my other two children. Even though I never told you, I treasure you a lot, Austin. On your every achievement, I felt proud. On your days of failure, I wanted to boost your spirit but couldn't do such a thing. Every happiness and grief, your mother cares about it all, Austin. Sorry for being late for saying this...but if you ever feel lonely and want to share something, I will always be there for you.\"\nRelying on someone was something Austin had learned from Luna, but this maternal warmth was something neither Luna nor anyone in this world could provide him with.\nHugging his mother like a small child, Austin murmured under their breath.\n\"Mm...\"\n__________________..\n[Present time]\nInside a thinly lit room stood two figures with varying expressions adorning their remarkable faces.\nThe one near the entrance of the massive hall was a pale silver-haired beauty who currently had her hand raised and mouth slightly parted as heavy breaths escaped the gape.\nIt was clearly visible how she was struggling even to stand properly while trying to maintain the frail mana barrier around her to forbade the man in front from approaching her.\nThe said man was smirking wildly as he enjoyed the fragile view of the girl whom he desired to attain the most. With a sigh, he spoke in a defeated voice as he didn't want to let the woman feel any more discomfort.\n\"You know, struggling here is futile, my dear Luna. You cannot win over the Demonic Artifact, which is made to suppress your mana specifically.\"\nLuna's eyes went wide as she heard Cain's statement, which would have been unreal to believe if she hadn't been present here, herself.\nIn between the harsh gasps, she tried to voice her thought which had been making her troubled since the time she realized her situation.\n\"Y-You couldn't have done all the-this on your own...tell me... *hah*...who is behind you...\"\nAs she spoke while trying to maintain the barrier, small lines of blood drew down the corner of her lips. Her body was trembling all over, with the mana barrier getting thinner, passing each second.\nHearing the query, Cain's grin disappeared, but as his sister had instructed, he didn't speak about anyone, especially about 'that' being even he wanted his Luna to know.\nRunning low on patience, Cain finally decided to end this banter and get what he wanted. Snatch what he deserves and win what always belonged to him.\n\"Enough of the talks, Luna. Now let go of the resistance and come with me.\"\nUnder the horrified gaze of Luna, Cain walked toward her as, with a sway of his hand, he shattered the barrier.\nLuna fell back on the door as Cain inched slowly toward her, with his previous disgusting grin returning across his face.\nJust as he was about to hold Luna's arm, a loud boom echoed in the room as, from the ceiling, descended a person who looked somewhat just like Cain.\nThe first prince's eyes stretched to their widest spot as he recognized the unexpected arrival, before a frightening voice echoed in the hall.\n\"Never had I expected something like this from you... Big Brother.\"\n________________\nA/N: - Explanation would be provided, and don't worry, Cain would die in the hands of our Wannabe Villain.\nUntil then~",

      "content": "Inside the reception hall built inside the premise of Eden Academy stood three prominent figures of the Empire with varying expressions spread over their faces.\nThe second prince and probable next Emperor of Gram, Mikhail, had a frightening look on his face as he coldly looked at a bastard named his brother, Cain.\nThose who closely knew Mikhail would have been shocked to see the all-time serene and calm-headed prince being in such an agitated state, like he might burn an ice pillar with his mere emotional flux.\nOn the other end, Cain's expression was a blend of terrified and repulsive as he never thought of someone intruding at this hour when all the preparation was already done.\nThe chicken-brained First Prince wasn't able to discern that a single person did this whole game plan, and that person was the only one who could ditch Cain at such a point.\nCain, indeed, was strong enough to obliterate a Unique class Demons horde single-handedly, but in comparison to Mikhail....he was far below.\n\"Don't you interrupt Mikhail! This is my personal matter. You stay out of it!\"\nCain growled in a high pitch while trying to put a bold front and, if possible, get things under his control.\nHearing the words Mikhail wasn't expecting after so many things happened, the blond prince's face contoured to an even darker shade as his anger reached its boiling point.\nBut before he could take action, another voice but this time feminine, resonated from Cain's side.\n\"Yeah, why are you interrupting, Prince Mikhail!? I was about to make this idiot blabber the important intel!\"\nLuna's annoyed voice made the previous furious Mikhail blink in perplexion, and it was the same for Cain, too, as he turned his head to see the person.\n\"Lu-Luna-san...are you alright now?\" (Mikhail)\n\"No...am dead.\"\nWith fake amusement, Luna replied as her previous miserable condition had vanished like she had never been thrown into such a state. Unlike before, her skin has regained its natural tone with no sign of her being struggling even to stand.\n\"H-How this can be...\"\nCain's eyes were at their widest point as he concluded that all this time, Luna was playing around to make him confess about the person who helped him in this whole situation.\nMikhail had a resigned expression as he somehow could digest Luna overpowering the demonic artifact, but her acting skills indeed made his heart move previously.\n\"No... No... No... No! This can't be happening!\"\n\"Hey, do you wanna live?\"\nAmidst his self-mumbling, Luna spoke in a low tone to Cain, upon which the latter blinked in utter disbelief.\n\"If you tell me who gave you this artifact, I will ensure that you leave this place alive today.\"\nThere was a reason why Luna wasn't resorting to the brutal way to know the information she had been eager to find for a while.\nSo what was left was only the game of words. She said she would let him escape safely, but what would happen after running away would be uncertain.\nMikhail's raging mind thought for a long minute as Mikhail also waited for this development since he trusted Luna's wits and sense of reasoning.\nHe had ways to restrain Cain outside the hall, so he was pretty much calm about the things happening.\n\"I will speak...but in return...can you... Can you step on me, please!?\"\nWith his voice mending in an utmost plead, Cain bowed in front of Luna, making the latter's mind blank for several seconds.\nMikhail facepalmed on such a shameful display of a high noble. Still, there wasn't anything he could say between them when he pretended to be oblivion about Luna's proposal.\nLuna was wholly weirded out, but she didn't think it was too much to grant, so she nodded and urged the man to speak.\nCain was delighted to the core as his dream to see Luna from that point of view seemed near reality. Standing back, he breathed heavily before he began to speak.\n\"Th-The being who got me this artifact and the one who has interfered various times in the school affairs in the past is the same person. Like the labyrinth, which was unsealed, and the two high-ranked demons during the war were also sent by that being.\"\nFrom start to end, Cain's expression shifted quite a lot as he muttered while reminiscing probably about the person he was talking about.\nMikhail and Luna didn't interrupt him as they awaited to know more about this person who had been playing cards from the background for who knows how long.\n\"I don't know his name, but if you want to fi-KHAKK!!\"\nSuddenly all natural color from Cain's face faded as a red runic spell circled his neck, seemingly choking him from talking any further.\n**Cough**Cough**\nCain dropped to the ground while coughing violently as the bind didn't kill him, but it seemed he wouldn't be talking any time soon.\n**SLING**\nWith a frightening speed, Mikhail launched a mana rope, which tied around Cain's arms and legs before he stepped forward. Amidst choking, Cain fell unconscious due to the effect of binding twine.\n\"Luna-san, for whatever problem my brother has caused, I beg your forgiveness. Tomorrow, an official apology, along with compensation, will be delivered to you, and I will make sure Prince Cain gets the treatment that a criminal should.\"\nMikhail bowed deeply as he pleaded for forgiveness which he knew was impossible to attain for what his brother had done. But contrary to his expectation, Luna gave a completely unpredictable answer.\n\"It's alright; I have gained from his foolishness to try to touch me. And about that official apology. If possible, send some lemon tea leaves as compensation.\"\nHer voice was strangely serene since she knew, from the start, Cain had no control over the situation, and she came with him because she knew there would be something useful she could discover.\n\"I will send the best quality of tea. Uh... Luna-san. I also have a request to make. I know it's imprudent of me to-.\"\n\"Just say it.\"\nLuna's mood became light as she heard about her favorite beverage, so hearing the request became a little bearable.\nMikhail inhaled deeply before he spoke in a meek tone.\n\"If possible....can you not tell me about this matter to Austin-san for the time being?\"\nLuna's eyes rounded in perplexion before she looked at Mikhail's expression and saw that he genuinely was worried about Austin's awareness of the matter.\n\"Well, I must disappoint you since I don't hide things from my husband, but can I ask why you are so worried about his knowledge on the matter?\"\nMikhail smiled bitterly as he replied with a defeated sigh.\n\"When it's about you, Luna-san, Austin practically loses his cool. Were you sheltered at the time of war right? Because of being weakened by the demon? What you missed was the wrath Austin-san bestowed on the battlefield and showed me what strength a human could harbor. If he suddenly turns like that toward Gram... I don't know what would.. \"\nMikhail still couldn't believe what he saw that day through the device, which was projecting the live scenario of war grounds.\nThe look in Austin's gaze and the way he dominated the other side, which comprised of Terror Rank demons, too, made Mikhail realize what asset Gram was overlooked until now.\n\"Is that so~Fufu...I didn't know he would get that angry~.\"\nAmidst his recollection, Mikhail heard small giggles before his eyes fell on the blushing Luna who was fidgeting at her place while muttering something he probably shouldn't hear.\nLooking at such a display from an all-time cold-faced maiden, Mikhail realized that the emotion called love was still early for him to learn.\n___________________...\nA/N: - There is a critical conversation part of Sophia and Austin. Should I write it down in the next chap or show it through Austin's talk to Luna?\nComment down~",

      "content": "[Tuesday, November 18th]\n[4.30 pm]\n**SLING**\nIt's been eleven days since the student-teaching teacher's session commenced and almost a week since Austin left.\nCurrently, on a grassy field that was specially built for students' practical training stood numerous faces varying in age.\nThis class belongs to the swordswoman who has been unknown until recently, but once she stepped into the teaching line, she shocked various onlookers.\nThe steel-hitting steel noise erupted from the center of the ground as the blade of a handsome raven-haired youth named Kyouki clashed with none other than the in-charge of the Weaponry and Martial class.\nSaya proposed an idea after she got requested to increase her teaching hours.\nShe challenged any of the students or professors to push her even a step away from her spot using their martial skills then she would instruct them an hour more than usual.\nThe challenge was taken by many, including the adults, but none of them was able to even cross their blades for more than two minutes with the battle goddess.\nSaya not only repelled their attack, she even countered with each blow so their morale could degrade, and they give up upon the thought of extra classes.\nBut on the third day, since the challenge was brought, Kyouki finally came forward wielding a regular blade making everyone gasp and excited for the dual between the two supreme warriors.\nSaya admits that Kyouki's agility and precision were better than most of the lot, but still, she could quickly see his next move since most of the attack becomes predictable after some time.\n**CLING**\nBlocking Kyouki's slim blade on the back of her own katana, Saya was able to discern the struggle Kyouki was going through since it's already been an hour; they had been engaged in this spar.\n\"Not bad. You are able to point out my blind spots and hit them with almost the same accuracy as your front ones.\"\nKyouki released the hold since he knew being this close to Saya would be nothing less than disastrous for him.\nJumping from his position, he stood some meters ahead of Saya as his gaze fell on the spot where she was standing, but alas, her feet hadn't moved an inch even though he had given his all.\n\"\"WOOAH**\nThe gasp and cheering from the audience finally subdued as it seemed Kyouki had finally reached his limit. From his outer appearance, one could tell how exhausted he was, with his lips parted and heavy breaths continuously leaking out of his mouth.\n\"What happened, Hero? Already reached the end? Sad, I was expecting more~.\"\nSaya teased slightly as she finally started to heat up fairly with the ferocious onslaught Kyouki introduced after so many days. Apart from the one-sided battle with Luna, Saya hasn't fought much, so this little display of authentic swordsmanship delighted her somewhat.\n\"I have a final attack, but I have to back it up with mana.\"\n\"Then you should. I never forbade using mana, but you have to apply your limbs or a weapon in your strike.\"\n**GASP**\nThe surroundings held their mouth as the words spoken by the instructor was incredibly startling.\nSoon, small murmurs and confident statements started erupting from the crowd.\n\"If I could have used mana, I definitely would have pushed Saya-sensei down.\"\n\"My [Crash Assault] would have undoubtedly worked if only I had known.\"\n\"Hey, isn't Saya-sensei getting a little partial here?\"\nSaya ignored all those muttering as her gaze was fixated on the promising young man in front; as she felt a golden hue gathering around Kyouki.\n\"If it's like that, I won't hold back any longer.\"\nWith a smirk, Saya readied her sword and made a stance for the first time as she replied in a voice that was oozing with the credence she held in her skills.\n\"Come at me with your strongest.\"\nWith his blade now shining like a bright sun, Kyouki pushed most of his mana to the edge as, with a long shout, he darted toward the lady.\n\"[Saberax]\"\n_____________________\n\"Hey, doesn't Luna seems a little downhearted today?\"\nIt was the beautiful olive-haired mage supporter, Sicily, who whispered in her party member Lilia's ear while they trained their mana under the supervision of the Saintess.\nThe class was mainly based on converting a simple object into a Mana Capicator Artifact.\nAt first, the theory seemed absurd since only alchemists and Sages can conjure the ruins and spells to build an artifact.\nBut to their utmost surprise, Luna not only showed them how to construct the spell but also demonstrated a live conversion that even Elite Alchemist would find challenging to accomplish.\nAmidst charging up a teapot with mana, Sicily asked before Lilia looked toward the stage and saw that, indeed, Luna's face was somewhat covered with dark clouds.\nMore like she seemed to be sad.\n\"Well, Austin's absence must have made her lonely.\"\nLilia sighed with her words as she felt the sentiment Luna had. She doesn't miss Austin but his being around gives her a sense of security. Of course, she wouldn't say this to Sicily.\n\"Even so, she looks incredibly pitiful. I wonder if there's something important today.\"\nJust as Sicily predicted, today was Luna's birthday which no one other than her maid back in Aurora and her grandmother knows.\nShe wasn't grieving because no one wished her or wasn't celebrating her birthday. On the contrary, she doesn't actually like to be reminded that it's her birthday. But today, she desperately wanted to be with a certain someone.\nLuna knew she wasn't a child anymore who should throw a tantrum about not being able to spend the day with her lover, but it was not like she was a doll who could control her emotions all the time.\nAfter the classes concluded at nearly eight, she didn't go to eat dinner; rather, she chose to stay alone for the time being.\nSaya asked her what was wrong, but Luna smiled and brushed off the topic. Saya also didn't ask any further since she herself was missing her brother that's why she could understand what Luna was going through.\nThe best place Luna finds to enjoy her solitude is the corner most resting benches in the school garden, where very few people wander.\nYes, it is the same place where Luna first time came to talk to Austin on her own initiative and from where the two started to know each other.\nIn a few words, this specific bench was the witness to the advent of their love story.\nWith a smile, Luna caressed the place Austin was sitting that night while grieving alone.\nThat night he was sad, and she tried to give him support, albeit in a peculiar way.\nBut now, when she is feeling down, he isn't here to console her.\n\"What a sore loser I am...\"\nWiping the droplets which involuntarily dripped down her cheek, Luna was about to get up and walk back to the dorm when a familiar voice halted her movements.\n\"Where do you think you are going?\"\n___________________\nA/N: - Did anyone say fluff?

      "content": "There was a day when Austin sat lonely on the bench when he felt all hope for him had vanished, and he had to spend the rest of his life in solitary.\nAt that time, Luna was the person who approached him with the distinguished purpose of just knowing this strange guy and what goes in his mind that he tries to act like a villain.\nNow this time, it was Luna who was feeling down on the day she arrived in this world. Back in her birthplace, her birthday was celebrated only by her maid.\nHer mother's illness made it impossible for her even to remember Luna's identity; her father never paid much heed to anything other than his power and reach.\nBut she could endure all of it until the man she loved stayed by her side and gave the support she was greedy for.\nShe wouldn't have complained to him whenever he arrived since her birthday didn't seem worth mentioning, but still, she was sad for today.\nBut who would have thought that, like everything in her life has been changing since she met her first love, this special day of hers would also change.\n\"Where do you think you are going?\"\nLuna's senses wafted with an incredibly familiar scent as she roamed her eyes and finally settled on the figure of a person she could identify, even from a mass crowd.\nThe same dazzling eyes, beautiful hair, and the kindest smile she had ever seen were adorned by none other than the person who had made her stupid in love.\n\"By that look in your eyes...I guess you missed me a lot more than I thought. \"\nWith his hands behind his back, Austin approached her as he spoke in a slightly teasing tone.\nA smile dared to spread across her face, but she instantly held herself back and turned her face with a pout.\n\"Who said I was missing you? I didn't even notice your absence. Hmph!\"\n\"Is that so? Then I might leave you alone for some more days.\"\nTo her utter astonishment, Austin vanished from his sight, and Luna's eyes widened before she turned herself in that direction but failed to notice where he went.\nBut before she could think or move, her face lit up with the illumination of candles that were decorated over a birthday cake. Startled, she heard Austin's voice, this time a lot closer than before.\n\"Do you think I would have forgotten?\"\nTurning on her back, she found her favorite eyes looking at her warmly.\nLuna looked at the cake again before her eyes turned slightly teary as she felt Austin's warm hand circling her waist.\nLeaning her head on his chest, a beautiful smile crept on her lips before her hands hugged his abdomen, not wanting to let go anymore.\n\"Let's sit now. This cake has already gone through a lot.\"\nAustin led Luna to the bench before cautiously putting down the small confectionary as he took the other side of the seat.\n\"Where did you buy it from? I have never seen this kind of flavor.\"\nThe cake was, by looks, seemed made of chocolate with a lot of choco chips sprinkled over it, but for Luna, it was foreign since choco chips hadn't been introduced to her until now. Not to talk about peculiar icing...\nAustin halted for some seconds before he scratched the back of his head and replied with an embarrassed smile.\n\"Actually, I have prepared this one myself...\"\nLuna blinked in surprise before she raised a query related to a confession he had made long ago.\n\"Didn't you say you were bad at cooking?\"\n\"Don't worry. I learned from a master chef back in my hometown before I made this. Now blow the candles, already.\"\nLuna didn't miss how bashful Austin had become as a teasing smile spread her lips. But for now, she kept her mischievous thoughts aside and blew gently over the cake.\n\"Happy birthday, Luna. May your upcoming years of life remain happy and peaceful.\"\nTurning her gaze, Luna spoke with a giggle.\n\"Then wish I always stay with you. That would make me the happiest.\"\nAustin just smiled in response before he brought a small knife out of his storage and cut a small piece of cake before extending it toward Luna.\nLuna parted her lips wide, but in the end, she could only bite one-fourth of the piece. It was adorable how she tried yet pecked like a bird.\nAustin took the rest of the piece of himself, but his face slightly contoured just upon receiving the taste.\n\"The bitterness of the chocolate is still there.\"\nEven though he tried to make the cake sweet since he knew Luna's favorability toward sweet things, he somehow failed to accomplish what he desired.\nLuna narrowed her gaze as her chewing instantly halted upon hearing Austin's words.\nLeaning forward, she grabbed his chin, and without letting him prepare, she connected her lips with him.\nAustin's eyes widened as it was rare for Luna to take the initiative, but he was far from unwelcoming.\nTaking Austin's astonishment as a leeway, Luna violated his tongue with hers and intervened and played with him to her heart's desire.\nThe cake in between the steamy kisses melted. Before Austin could fight back, he was already at the mercy of his dominant lover.\nParting her lips, she saw the vulnerable expression of her beloved, who was panting raggedly with his slightly swollen lips parted.\n\"Was it sweet enough, now?\"\nUnlike Austin, Luna's voice was fine as she marveled at the sight and spoke in a slight coquettish tone.\nAustin nodded mindlessly as he was too overwhelmed by the unexpected attack.\nLuna's breaths also became rough as her excitement increased upon seeing Austin in such a state. Licking her lips, Luna leaned forward as her hand made its way to a particular region of Austin, making the latter gasp.\nNearing her lips to his ears, Luna whispered in a tone that might corrupt the holiest saint alive.\n\"Today is my birthday. So why don't you leave everything to me and let this Onee-san show you something new~.\"\nAustin gulped hard as he heard the dangerous words, which instantly made his reasoning numb and his mind blank.\nTurning his head slightly, he spoke in a meek tone.\n\"I will be in yo-your care, then, Luna-sama.\"\n__________________..\nA/N: - Ah, they and their kinks.\nDrop a comment if you are liking the story and are ready for some action ~",

      "content": "\"Hmmm....so prince Cain is in prison now. And that tea leaves are compensation.\"\nUnder the cozy blanket laid an exceptionally charming couple consisting of a handsome blond youth and a young silver-haired otherworldly beauty.\nThe sun hadn't risen behind the curtains, signifying that dawn was still far away.\nThe chillness of November has made it necessary for one to have covered at night, but looking at the couple, there seemed to be no need for blankets to warm them up.\nWith her head resting on Austin's well-built chest, Luna's hands were draped lazily as she enjoyed the early morning warmth of her beloved.\nWith her eyes closed in sleepiness, she narrated the whole event which occurred a week or so ago in the reception hall. Her curiosity lay in the reaction Austin would give upon hearing First Prince's attempt toward her.\nBut contrary to Luna's expectation, Austin stayed silent for several seconds, which in turn made Luna worried before she parted her lids and supported her chin on his upper body.\n\"What are you thinking?\"\nAustin seemed to be in a stupor as hearing Luna's call; he hurriedly pulled his gaze to her with a soft smile spreading on his lips.\n\"Nothing much... Ah, that reminds me.\"\nLuna wasn't unfamiliar with the man. The way he shifted the flow of conversation and stole his gaze away told her how uncomfortable he got to hear about the incident. Even slightly, she could feel his hold on her tightening as he spoke in a rushed tone.\n\"Did you find anything on the demon responsible for these peculiar mana-suppressing artifacts? This teaching and returning home kept me quite busy these days.\"\nThere were many incidences which has proven that, unlike in the past, demons have started cooperating with humanity for some uncertain reason.\nMany, like Austin, had knowledge that demons are bound with their Liege, mainly known as Monarch of Darkness, Demon Lord. Them betraying their master and serving their nemesis was a frightening discovery in itself.\nThis not only increased the level of Demon's reach but also gave a sense of cautiousness on whom to trust or from whom to be wary.\n\"I did get some clue but not much. I have to investigate through my sources and see where this goes.\"\nReplied with a sigh; Luna fell on Austin once again as she didn't like how such a small matter was getting prolonged day after day.\nShe has a hunch that every human involved with Underworld, whether the student of Eden Academy or the ex-hero of Xylex, has been in contact with a singular existence.\nBut until she doesn't get the full proof evidence, she can't play her cards and dig that mole out of its hole.\n\"Then there is a labyrinth too. I doubt that there is something in there we should be worried about. But there's a hassle about mana restriction.\"\nAustin also sighed at the weird feeling he suffered inside, which was still vivid in his mind, and before things got ugly on the land, he wanted to clear the mystery of the labyrinth.\nThere was a brief silence in the room as the two understood that in order to accomplish these two goals, they had to go separate ways.\nLuna was a remarkable mage, no doubt, but inside the labyrinth required more combat work. And as for investigation, Luna hasn't really told Austin about all of her secrets, and neither does he ask.\nAustin knew when the time come, she would tell him everything. But the essence remains in their detachment once again, even though they just met.\nWith her eyes tightly closed, Luna hugged him even more rigidly as she didn't like the idea, yet she understood why this was important.\nKnowing well how Luna was feeling at the moment, Austin smiled in defeat as he patted the sulky Saintess' head softly.\n\"Once we get free from all these...let's go on a vacation, okay?\"\nLuna instantly shot up her head before glaring at Austin despite her heart being lighted up with joy.\n\"Not vacation but honeymoon...\"\nLuna poked his chest with a pout to warn her husband about the slip of words.\nSeeing such an adorable gesture, Austin couldn't help but grin as he replied while rubbing her head.\n\"Hai. It will be our honeymoon.\"\n_________________..\nNearly at six, when a cold wisp of breeze was howling around the vicinity, stood a beautiful woman in her early twenties swinging her blade toward particularly nothing.\nHer build was tall and lean but well-proportioned. Along with a warrior's physique, the woman had the charm a female dreams of having.\nAs sweat dripped down her chin, the woman readied herself to take the sharp slash bisecting the falling leaf in front. But before she could have moved, an incredibly familiar voice came from her behind.\n\"As diligent as ever, huh, little sister.\"\nSaya's eyes widened as, after a week, she became extremely anxious about her beloved's well-being, and suddenly, hearing his voice made her flustered.\nDropping her blade, Saya turned on her heels before her eyes found the image they sought desperately.\n\"Onii-sama...!\"\nIt seemed Saya was about to embrace her big brother, but soon her excitement subdued as she held herself back.\nAustin made a puzzled expression before he spoke in an unsure tone.\n\"What happened? No longer want big brother's hug?\"\nSaya slowly shook her head with her eyes tightly shut before she confessed something embarrassing even though they had met after so long.\n\"I am sweaty right now, Onii-sama. Once I freshen up, please hug me for a long while.\"\nSaya could never reject her Onii-sama, but in her current state, she might give him an unpleasant experience, so she should endure for now.\nBut little did she think her Onii-sama would be so bold and unfair to attack her without warning.\nWith his hand on her back, Austin draped Saya's head on his chest as he patted the silly little girl before scolding her.\n\"When did you become so formal with me? You used to see me at my worst when I used to get sick often, and now you are getting conscious of such trivial things? Oh lord...what I will do with this child.\"\nSaya's face flushed to the point where steam started erupting over her as she hid by snuggling close in her brother's warmth.\nAfter the touching reunion, they separated as Austin asked about the past days, which Saya reported without fabrication.\nThey chatted for almost half an hour as Austin came to know Kyouki's progressive development and the information related to the thing he asked Saya to keep an eye on.\n\"Well, since it's an hour before the cafeteria opens, why don't we have a spar or two in the meantime?\"\nSaya's eyes lit up instantly as she raised her hand and called out her sword through summoning. Sparring with her brother was one of the things she had yet to try, and when there was a chance, she wouldn't let it go.\n'I hope I don't disappoint Onii-sama.'\n____________________...\nA/N: - There would be an arc or two in continuation. The plot will now leap with various pieces joining the fray.\nLet's see where this goes~.",

      "content": "\"Look at those...I can feel the chills even though they are so far away.\"\nCurrently standing on the highest tower of Eden Academy stood two figures consisting of an olive-haired young maiden and a handsome youth as they saw the scene taking place in an open ground.\nThe youth, named Kyouki, had his eyes constantly fixed on the two warriors who were clashing blades with such fineness and accuracy, that made him immensely in the spar without a blink, daring to interrupt.\nEven Sicily was wonderstruck after seeing Saya and Austin crossing blades at such a violent pace yet having a defensive stance not to let harm each other.\nShe preferred heavy weapons more, but she couldn't deny how beautiful it seemed to see the such fine art of swordsmanship.\nEarly in the morning, Sicily and Kyouki decided to have combat training. Since Lilia wasn't proficient in physical work, she was asked to cultivate her magical capacity just like she had been doing past weeks.\nSince that time, Kyouki has witnessed how inferior he is if compared to the challenges yet to be proposed; he has been diligently training in secret.\nEven though they were left with only three, the Hero's party took risks and ventured High-Rank Lairs to grow strong so they don't die worthlessly in front of future threats.\n\"How long would it take me to reach that level....\"\nKyouki muttered under his breath as his eyes followed only Austin's movement.\nFrom what he had heard from Venessa and seen these past few days, Kyouki could confidently say Saya was way out of his league. She's on a level he could only dream about if he practiced swordsmanship for more than five or maybe more years.\nBut what bothered him was Austin.\nIt was widely known that Austin was an Elemental Mage through and through. And generally, Mages don't move the way Austin was.\nWas it the training he went through that Kyouki neglected? Is he a natural-born warrior who is destined to surpass everyone? What he lacked that Austin mastered?\nKyouki indeed had such thoughts and doubts, but there weren't obstacles that would be stopping him now from walking on the path of being the strongest.\nIf before he wanted to grow to fight evil, an add-on of surpassing Austin became the second last step of it.\nThe last step to accomplish all his hard work would undoubtedly be the demon king for whom Kyouki was born to fight and slaughter.\nKnowing apparently what was going through her beloved's mind, Sicily held his hand before leaning her head on his shoulder.\n\"Let's do our best together, Kyo-kun. It might be a rocky path, but I promise to always stay with you.\"\n(A/N: - Flag?)\n_________________...\n[3 days later]\nIt's been three days since Austin returned to Eden's Academy and reunited with his two beloveds, albeit a little peculiarly.\nThese days apart from teaching, Luna and Austin have been together all the time like they were glued to each other. Apparently, it was Luna who didn't want to let go of him since she knew 'the time' was nearing.\nSaya after realizing what her big brother had planned and how she could be with him, Saya left the Saintess to have her Onii-sama all she wanted for now.\nThe class has taken a trail with Austin, Luna, and Saya's exceptional teaching. Just some more days and they would at least reach a level where a group could face Terror Class demon.\nWhat they require are perseverance and rigorous training, and for that, regular professors would be enough for the students—concluding that the three didn't need to play instructors for more than a little longer.\nIn the evening, Austin, after having a peaceful chat with Saya and Luna on tea, went to meet the headmaster to talk about the labyrinth.\nJust as he was about to knock on the highest door of the academy, a familiar voice approached from his back before Austin turned toward the source.\n\"Oh my~ Pleased to meet you again, Professor.\"\nTiara greeted Austin just like she did on the first day. Even though they have been in contact through class, Tiara's etiquette never faltered.\nAustin also greeted the princess with a slight bow.\n\"Likewise, your highness. And please refrain from calling me professor in person.\"\nTiara giggled upon seeing how Austin gets troubled being called in such a manner but who would like to miss such an adorable reaction?\n\"That won't do, professor. Teaching for once, being a teacher for life. I have learned various valuable things from you, so no one could stop me from admiring you as my mentor.\"\nWitnessing the tease in the cheeky princess' voice, Austin resigned in pursuing before he asked something more relevant to their situation.\n\"Were you going to meet the headmaster, your Highness?\"\n\"Yes, I was, but if it's something confidential you want to talk with him about, I will come back later.\"\nErasing her mischievousness, Tiara spoke serenely as she didn't want to interrupt where she wasn't supposed to. Of course, she would know the content of what he would be talking about inside, but Tiara has to keep a good face in front of her beloved.\nAustin thought for a second, but soon, he came to a decision and spoke in a certain tone.\n\"No...on the contrary, I would like you to hear what I am going to say.\"\n____________________...\nA/N: - Pace is good?\nLemme know in the comments~",

      "content": "**Knock**\n\"It's me, sir. Austin.\"\nAs he informed, the person on the other side replied in affirmation to enter before Austin twisted the doorknob and gave space for the lady to enter first.\n\"Oh my~ Thank you, Sir Austin.\"\nClosing the door on his back, Austin saw the two prominent faces greeting each other before he walked to the center and offered his own greetings.\n\"Thanks for making time for me, headmaster.\"\nUndoubtedly the Grandmaster of Eden Academy, who plays various roles in the upper echelon of Gram, too, doesn't stay leisurely in general.\nUpon hearing Austin, Headmaster smiled warmly as he replied, \"No, it's quite acceptable. Instead, I wanted to meet Austin too, to extend my gratitude.\"\nMerlin twirled his finger before a teapot, and a plate of confections got served on the table. Preparing the tea, the white beard continued speaking.\n\"It would not be appropriate for me to say, but in all honesty…the things you, Luna, and Saya-san have taught the people in the academy…I might not have even reached there in all three years. Or to say, I myself don't know various things which my students now know. You brought them to such a stage that I could never have. I know it won't be much, but if in case you need my support, then, please don't hesitate, Austin.\"\nAs the old man concluded, the freshly brewed herbal tea, which had a strong aroma, invited the princess to taste it instantly.\nSeeing the impatience from the all-time composed princess, Austin couldn't help but smile since the gesture was quite familiar to him.\n\"Is something the matter, Sir Austin?\"\nTiara perplexedly tilted her head, but Austin just shook his head and looked forward to the headmaster.\n\"Regarding that. I was expecting favor from you, headmaster, and that's the reason I came today. \"\nTiara sipped crisply as she looked at the scene with curiosity filling her gaze. On the other side, Merlin also brought his attention toward the young man as he nodded for him to continue.\nTaking the tea, Austin took a sip, and indeed it had a peculiar taste of herbs. Placing the cup on the saucer, he spoke the rest of his words.\n\"I want to venture the Abyss.\"\n*Klrk**\n\"Sumimase.\"\nTiara's cup made an audible sound since Austin's words made her incredibly startled. The same reaction was expressed by the bearded man, too, as he looked at the blond boy in astonishment.\nThe place Austin mentioned was undoubtedly the labyrinth hidden under their feet. The only place where even Merlin frets to dwell and the pandora's box, which has the world's knowledge-shattering beings hidden.\nEven Emperor William had halted every matter concerning the ancient wormhole, which his predecessors also didn't leave any information about.\nDespite being so near to them, the labyrinth is entirely mysterious up to the date.\n\"I won't ask the reason, nor would I encourage such a dangerous notion, but to let you inside the labyrinth, it would require official permission from the Majesty himself. I might send a letter to request approval, but there's no guarantee of how much time a response will arrive. May days, weeks, or even months wouldn't be surprising.\"\nIt was undoubtedly a matter which would require a thorough inspection and analysis before Emperor William would conclude.\nAnd there was the uncertainty of acceptance for Austin's proposal too.\n\"Damn! Only if there would have a faster method.\"\nClenching his fist in annoyance, Austin muttered under his gritted teeth since he didn't want to prolong this trip any longer due to specific reasons.\n\"There is nothing I can do about it, Austin. I am sorry.\"\nMerlin also resigned calmly since he couldn't force the Majesty to do anything in haste, nor he had the authority to let Austin dive into the wormhole without any permission.\nAt times of hopelessness, suddenly, a voice lightened the expectancy.\n\"Please rely on me, Sir Austin.\"\nSuddenly a determined voice belonging to the eldest princess of Gram, Tiara, resonated before she assured her dejected male god.\n\"I will discuss this with my father and get you the acceptance within three days. You might be asked to meet my brother Mikhail first, but I assure you, I will not let this wish of yours get postponed any longer.\"\nHer voice contained a strange glint of resolve like it had become a mission to accomplish so she could make her beloved happy.\nAustin grinned as he thanked his fortune that Tiara bumped at such a golden hour, and as he expected, she would help him get her father's consent.\nOn the other side, Tiara, along with being resolute, had elation filling her inside as it was her first chance to be beneficial to Austin.\nTurning toward the lady with a bright smile, which made the receiver's breath choke, Austin spoke his gratitude as he held her hand gently.\n\"I will never forget this favor of yours, princess. Thank you for the generosity you bestowed.\"\n⁠ ⁠◑⁠ ◑_______________⁠◑⁠ ⁠◑\n[9.13 p.m]\n[Austin's dorm room]\n\"So, Onii-sama is going to venture in the abyss in the upcoming four days, and he wants my assistance. Of course, I am on it. Why is Onii-sama even asking.\"\nSaya spoke in a tone that said there wasn't any room for hesitation. She had a hunch, and now when she finally got her brother's confirmation, she wasn't going to let him dwell in such a dangerous place alone.\nAustin smiled as he expected such a response but still hearing his sister's strong words made him feel how quickly she has grown up.\n\"Try to keep your paws away from my husband, okay? If he gets dirtied because of you, I will spank you until it's red.\"\nLuna, who was currently sitting in Austin's lap, growled while glaring at the raven-haired girl, much to Austin's perplexion.\nSaya smirked for a blink before she made an innocent face and spoke in bafflement.\n\"I don't know what are you talking about..\"\nWith a 'Hmph! ' the annoyed saintess turned her head and dipped her face in her favorite warmth, and while she was at it, she took Austin's hand and put it over her head.\nYes, she's spoilt! So what!?\n\"Onii-sama… if mana doesn't work there…won't that go for mana-potions too? Not to talk about medic and storage.\"\nAustin held his sister's hand while patting his lover before he helped her calm down.\n\"It's okay, Saya. Nii-chan got everything sorted.\"\n_________________\nA/N: - Drop a comment~",

      "content": "[It was around the time when Austin returned from his hometown. After Luna told Austin about the incident in the reception hall with Prince Cain, he paid a visit to the royal capital.]\n♣-----------♣\n\"Have the tea been sent to Luna-san?\"\n\"Hai, My lord.\"\nIn an extravagantly decorated hall that was shining with the radiance of its natural golden color walked two remarkably charming people varying in gender.\nThe girl who just replied to her master was, by appearance, a female in her early twenties with long auburn hair neatly tied in a ponytail that bumped with each of her steps.\nHer facial features were undoubtedly above average, with a high nose and sharp hazelnut-shade eyes, which could make one nervous about glancing upon yet too inviting to ignore.\nThe man she was following and regarded as her lord was the most probable successor of the throne of Gram, Mikhail.\nThe woman he asked various things along the way to his office was his assistant and bodyguard, Jeanne. The only person on whom Mikhail trusts and relies entirely.\n\"Let's see how First Emperess reacts when she hears about it… \"\nWhat happened some days ago has put a heavy boulder on him since it wasn't just any measly person who attempted to do such an offense with the Saintess of Humanity.\nNobody knew that the first prince, Cain, could be so treacherous to lay hands on someone, using a demonic artifact, no less.\nThe facts, despite being bitter, Alex introduced in court at times of the War of Eden Academy, have been becoming a reality, day after day.\nNot only students or soldiers have been getting involved with the nemesis of humanity, but now the royalties too. It really was uncertain now whom to trust or from whom to be wary.\nThe First wife of Emperor William and the mother of Cain haven't taken any action regarding the news of her son's imprisonment. But the silence was more deadening than any reaction.\nFor now, Mikhail has to look out for one person since he knows what depends on that person's response to this whole incident.\n\"Keep a close eye on the Academy, and let me know when Austin arrives.\"\n\"Certainly, my lord.\"\nAs Jeanne responded, she entered the office with the prince only to get startled at her first step.\nWith her hand falling on the hilt of her sword in reflex, she narrowed her gaze and stood in front of Mikhail to shield him from the possible threat sitting lazily on the office chair.\nMikhail's eyes widened before he grabbed Jeanne's hand and shook his head in denial.\n\"Don't, Jeanne. We can't afford to further offend him.\"\nMikhail spoke in a whispering tone before he walked away from his overprotective bodyguard's shadow, despite her pleading not to.\n\"My lord, but….\"\n\"Don't worry, Lady Jeanne. I came here to talk.\"\nThe person who happened to be the most significant concern Mikhail had recently said in a tone that sent a shiver down the lady's back, but she held her ground and kept her eyes on the intruder.\n\"There's a procedure to meet the Prince, Sir Austin. If you may, you should also feel obliged to them.\"\nHearing the stiffness in her voice, Austin shrugged his shoulder as he replied, \"Well, I will keep it in mind from next time.\"\nJeanne glared at the blond youth before following Mikhail to the head seat opposite Austin. Pulling the chair, she helped the man before standing on his left with her guard pulled all the time.\nMikhail had an apologetic smile on his face as he greeted the guest.\n\"It's been a while, Austin-san. How have you been.\"\nMikhail had no idea when Austin returned, but there was no doubt why he came here for. For even a minuscule, Mikhail had hopes that Luna wouldn't tell him about it…but nothing goes what one expects them to.\nFor now, he could only hope to get things through without making their relationship any more bitter than it already has.\nMikhail has an eye for powerful entities and in front of him was someone with the colossal potential to become one of the strongest pillars standing at the frontiers of Gram in the future.\nWhen he gets on the throne, Mikhail needs people like him so he can run the empire way better than his father. Now, one could guess why Mikhail gives such importance to an ex-noble boy.\n\"Let's get straight to the point, Your Highness. That would save time for both of us. \"\n\"!!\"\nJeanne's glare became even denser as she felt utterly agitated hearing how prudently Austin was toward her lord. But nothing of that worked on the receiver as Austin's gaze remained on the front man.\nMikhail took a sip of water between the chilling gaze of two people before he nodded for the guest to continue.\n\"Hand me, Prince Cain.\"\nMikhail brought his composure back, leaning his chin on the intervened fingers as he responded in a serious tone.\n\"What if I reject?\"\nJeanne had no respect or loyalty toward Cain, but still, when Austin asked so directly about the man who, despite being a perverted criminal, was the first prince, it made the woman amazed.\nBut upon hearing her lord suggesting a possible rejection, her body stiffened before she readied herself in case things went South.\nAnd looking at Austin's change in temperament, her alertness has proven to be justified.\n\"It's not a question about whether you permit me or not. Prince Cain is already dead, in my perception. Either you make the route easy by agreeing right here and now, or I bring down the fortress and fulfill what I desire. I don't mind the chaos, but would you sacrifice your men to stop the inevitable?\"\nHis voice, from start to end, remained emotionless, with a peculiar intent filling his hollow gaze. Austin didn't care even if the front man was the next Emperor. For him, anyone who dares to touch his beloved has no other way to compensate rather than death.\nMikhail understood the stance of the matter and how serious Austin was with his words. Of course, there were elite warriors in the Gramanian court and veterans like Charles and Alex, but it was uncertain which side would receive more damage.\nMikhail already has seen, through two events what capability Austin carries to the point he handled multiple Terror Ranks one-sidedly. Not to mention the high-tier artifacts he holds, which not even the Royal Treasury could match.\nIf Mikhail rejects the boy now, not only would there be a disastrous mayhem break out, but also all the possibility of taking Austin as one of Gram's assets would completely vanish.\nAfter ten minutes or so of deep contemplation, it seemed Mikhail finally concluded. After gulping down the water, he directed his gaze back to the boy with a small smile spreading on his face.\n\"Tonight at 10.30. You might want to check the southwest exit of the palace. And yes, please be a little less flashy if you may.\"\nJeanne's brows raised in astonishment upon witnessing the exchange. From outer observation, one could never guess what kind of trade has taken place at the moment.\nOn the other side, Austin nodded as his expression eased a little before he stood up and extended his hand.\nMikhail followed the suite and, after standing up, held the hand in a shake.\n\"I will remember this consideration, Your highness. Farewell.\"\nWith that, Austin left with the attainment of what he came for, leaving a troubled Prince behind.\nDropping on the chair, Mikhail's mind went through various thoughts as he asked his assistant to prepare a strong coffee.\n'I better talk with Alex before this news breaks out….'\n________________\nA/N: - And so, the eldest prince's story concludes here. I know it was short and dramatic, but what can we do? There might arise a case of social tension between Austin and Gram, but well, he doesn't care about such things anymore.\nDrop a comment if you are hyped for the Labyrinth arc~",

      "content": "It's been two days since the meeting took place in the headmaster's office, and Tiara took the role of relaying Austin's request to her father, mainly known as the Emperor of Gram.\nSince then, Austin has been preparing the items and weapons he needs inside the labyrinth and sorting them out inside his inventory.\nA quest in between the days arrived for hunting some demons but other than that, the system has been staying silent ever since.\nWell, Austin didn't bother with it more than necessary since he knew, other than a few skills and inventory, the system couldn't take anything from him. And as for the things he has in inventory, Austin has made a backup for that, as well.\nFinally, the day arrived for his meeting with Royal Highness Prince Mikhail, for which Austin used Teleportation this time, unlike the last visit, where he flew all the way from Eden Academy to the Capital.\nArriving at the palace, his treatment by the officials and guards has become incredibly bothersome. They salute with high-pitched greetings at every corner.\n\"\"WE PAY RESPECT TO THE HONORARY WARRIOR!! \"\"\nLike this one.\nAfter the ceremony, an image of Austin as a war veteran had been getting widespread in significantly less time. There were those too, who still didn't believe that someone without Goddess' Blessing could be so mighty and such.\nBut then again, in a way or another, Austin was getting the attention that he never sought. If only not for his mother's request, Austin would have left Gram after sorting out this Labyrinth issue.\n'*Sigh*...another year in the academy is it…. '\nSighing in weariness, he made his way to the office he had visited some days ago, only to be halted by a beautiful woman.\n\"It's been a while, Jeanna-san.\"\nThe person responsible for Prince Mikhail's assistance and protection, Jeanne Calight, stood in front of the door with guards stationed at either side.\nJust like the last time, Jeanna still was wary of Austin but what changed was her perception after what she saw happening with the first prince, Cain.\nNever she thought that a mere boy in his teenage years would not even hesitate to slaughter a High Noble like a pig to the point, even she vomited on the spot.\nOf course, she didn't have sympathy for Cain, but to think that only attempting to touch this person's girlfriend could result in such death…\nShe, indeed, was shaken up to the core.\n\"I apologize for the impolitic behavior I displayed the last time, Sir Austin.\"\nRather than greetings, what Jeanne chose was to ask for forgiveness as she realized what position Austin might be acquiring in no time in the court of Gram.\nShe respects strong people despite not trusting him even a bit.\n\"You were doing your job, Lady Jeanne. That's not something you should be feeling regretful about, no?\"\nWith a thin smile, Austin entered inside, leaving a stunned Jeanne on the spot as she understood her mistake. But what was spoken couldn't be taken back, so she chose to follow him inside.\n…\n\"Pleasure to meet you after so long, Austin-san.\"\nAustin was a little perplexed why Mikhail said 'after so long,' but soon realized the reason.\n'We are being tapped….'\nIt didn't take long for him to survey the office before he located three artifacts placed at distinct places, which probably would have been built to transmit the talks they would be having now.\nFollowing suit, Austin also extended his hand and offered his greeting with a wry smile spreading on his lips.\n\"I am honored to meet you after so…long, Your Highness.\"\nShaking hands wasn't a greeting someone in the position of Austin should use for a high noble like Mikhail. But neither of them minded such courtesy and treated each other like equals.\nAfter offering the seat, both men sat facing each other as the beautiful sharp-eyed woman stood beside her lord while keeping an eye on the surroundings.\nWhat amused her was the not-so-believable acting Austin had just presented. But, well, she would keep it to herself…for now.\n\"My sister, Tiara, has proposed a request to Your Majesty regarding your permit to enter the Abyss. Am I on point?\" (Mikhail)\nAustin nodded without hesitation before he saw Jeanne walking to the door since they heard two consecutive knocks on it.\nA tray filled with baked snacks and two cups was slid inside before the lady brought it up to the table and served the men while maintaining the silence.\nAustin did a quick survey and found no suspicious add-on in the coffee, fortunately. As he took the first sip, he heard the Prince continuing.\n\"As per our history, you must have known how many elite warriors have lost their lives in that place since the labyrinth doesn't support the essence of our strength, mana.\"\n\"I am aware of those facts.\"\nEnjoying the bitterness of the beverage, Austin replied in an unconcerned tone making the Prince even more anxious.\nExhaling deeply, Mikhail continued, \"And you want permission to venture into that lair of mystery without even letting us know your goal? Is that what you desire, Sir Austin?\"\nHis anxiousness was building from the probable consequences which might arise if Mikhail permitted Austin to dive into that hell hole.\nBut just as he expected, Austin is a tough nut who couldn't be cracked with mere words.\n\"It's exactly what I want, Your Highness.\"\nSipping on the last drop, Austin concluded his words which had no room for negotiation or possible way of stopping him.\nMikhail observed the boy for some seconds, but in the end, he couldn't find a single uncertainty in his resolve.\nSighing, he accepted his defeat.\n\"Okay then, Austin-san. You will have permission to dive in the Labyrinth, but there's a condition you have to agree to get this deal settled.\"\nAustin expected something like this from the start. Royalties, letting a teenager have all the fun without getting their nose stacked in it… was unlikely to be the case. And Mikhail's words confirmed that speculation.\n\"You have to take someone from the court inside the Labyrinth. . I assure you that the person would only be helpful to you, and the last thing she will become would be a burden.\"\nAustin blinked in perplexion as this twist came out of nowhere before he saw Mikhail pronouncing a name, which tingled a part of his memory.\n\"Cordelia.\"\nA black shadow emerged on the right of Mikhail before the figure of a young woman appeared out of nothingness.\nBefore analyzing anything about her, what made Austin astonished was the identity of the person.\n'How can I forget about her…\n_______________\nA/N: - Drop a comment if you are hyped for the next chapter.",

      "content": "Everything was resolved from the Capital. Austin received a written confirmation that he may dive into the Ancient Labyrinth built beneath the Eden Academy, under the close supervision of a Gramanian Court Official named Cordelia.\nInside a small meeting room where the hero's party generally gathers, could be seen several figures with varying expressions on their face.\nFrom all of them, the ugliest expression was adorned by the olive shade-haired mage supporter, Sicily, as she saw the sight in front.\nLilia also didn't have a pleasant face when she saw her beloved in such an intimate space with another woman, but she somehow pulled herself together.\nSaya and Austin stood at a different corner while chatting about various things. Well, it was Saya who mostly talked and told her Onii-sama about some of the things related to their past life and such.\nThese two were entirely unbothered by the reunion happening in the middle of the room.\nThe reunion of two childhood friends…\n\"Oh lord, you can't imagine how worried I was all this time, Kyo-chan. Thank God, you are safe and healthy.\"\nThe raven-haired girl whom Mikhail delegated to take along inside the Labyrinth, Cordelia, was currently hugging her childhood friend, Hero Kyouki.\nAnd yes, she is one of the late-introduced heroines of the manga Austin used to read.\nShe's a person who the Royal Palace scouted at an early age due to the skill she carries, called Shadow Manipulation. The talent, as it seemed, was unique enough not to let Cordelia get mixed up in a town of commoners.\nAt the age of 10, before Kyouki was bestowed with his blessing from the Goddess of Light, Cordelia was taken to the Royal court, and unfortunately, she had to get separated from her best friend.\nIt was quite disheartening for the girl, but she had the ambition to become strong so she could protect Kyouki.\nAt times she heard Kyouki become a hero, she wanted to go and congratulate him, but the strict orders of the Upper Echelons restricted her from roaming outside.\nWhat she has been doing for seven years is rigorous training and honing her skills so she can work as a battle tool for Gram and also be helpful to her childhood sweetheart.\nEven though she was introduced more than half of the story had already progressed, she had a significant impact on the audience's perception.\nReason?\nCordelia is a yandere.\nShe doesn't only see Kyouki as a friend but even more than a husband. She worships him in a way.\nIn the manga, she had a great rivalry against the others, especially Luna, since Kyouki had all his attention converged on Luna most of the time.\nThanks to Venessa's interference in the matter, Luna was saved from being assassinated once. After that event, Kyouki slowly started realizing everyone's feelings, and they got their happy endings.\n*BAM**\n\"E-Ehhhh? Onii-sama!? Nande?\"\nAustin suddenly slammed his head on the wall, which made a small crater at the place. The noise naturally brought everyone's attention to him as Austin spoke with a wry smile.\n\"I just needed to keep something out of my head.\"\nThe picture of Luna marrying Kyouki have popped up in his head twice until now and by no mean was he delighted from his shitty mind about it. He knew it was all a fictional thing to happen, but still, it annoyed him.\nAfter assuring his worried sister that he was okay, Austin looked at the four with their gaze fixed on him. The most noticeable one was from Cordelia, who was glaring daggers at the person who ruined her reunion.\n\"It's nine right now. We have to depart in less than fourteen hours. Kyouki, I hope informing you beforehand would have been useful.\"\nWithout minding the intense stare, Austin asked the boy who would be this venture's fourth member. Since Kyouki has the ability to store Light Energy inside him and from what Saya told him, he has become more proficient with his sword; the hero becomes the prime subject to take inside the Abyss.\nAustin might be confident in his skills, but what's not known could be dangerous even for the mightiest being. So he chose to be safe rather than to be sorry.\n\"Yes, I have been preparing what I need and will report strictly at 11 near the headmaster's office.\"\nAustin nodded in satisfaction before he turned toward his sister.\n\"Saya. Get all the things I asked, along with the herbs and antidotes, and meet me at my dorm around eight in the morning.\"\nWith a resolute face, Saya nodded as she said, \"Understood, Onii-sama.\"\nBack to the front, Austin looked at the teenage girl who, by appearance, looked slightly older and stood just beside Kyouki.\n\"Cordelia-san. I hope you can bring yourself on time.\"\n\"Before that. Tell me one good reason why you are acting like a leader when we have a hero in the team?\"\nAustin had expected such a trivial thing to be raised. A hero is destined to lead people on the path of prosperity and *blah*blah*.\nBut it wasn't Austin who replied; rather, a heavy voice resonated profoundly in the room, sending shivers down the listener's spine.\n\"Keep your tone in check, girl, before I mute it forever. Again, if you dare to talk like that with my Onii-sama, I will help you feel a new sensation called dread, understood?\"\nSaya's voice contained no particular emotion, unlike the times she talks with her brother. Her violet eyes which never left Cordelia, held an intent that made the latter back away in an instant, with sweat accumulating on her forehead.\n(A/N: - Remind me if I had mentioned Saya's eye before.)\nEven Sicily and Lila were taken aback by such a shift in temperament. At this moment, they made a mental note about their behavior toward Austin.\nAustin shook his head in helplessness before he patted the little sister of his, who worries a lot when it comes to him.\n\"There…there.\"\nSaya pouted as her severe expression vanished in a second. She didn't like how her brother doesn't let her get angry at those who disrespects him, but by no means could she reject his pats.\nAfter calming down the child, Austin looked back to the others as he spoke his concluding words.\n\"Okay then, guys. Sleep well for tonight since who knows how long we will be missing our beds. And yes, don't forget to farewell properly to your loved ones since inside the Labyrinth, no one knows what awaits us.\"\n_____________..\nA/N: -Drop a comment.",

      "content": "After Austin and Saya left, who remained were the three of Hero's party and the new temporary recruitment, Cordelia Calight.\nCordelia wanted to be with Kyouki alone, but looking at the other two women's expressions, she understood that would be close to impossible for now.\nShe indeed thought that after becoming a hero, Kyouki would become popular with women. Still, just after entering the Academy, he had three beauties fawning over him, which now had come down to two.\nShe was well-informed about Venessa, Sicily, and Lilia. And the lady called the Saintess for whom her Kyo-chan did so many things in foreign continents too.\nDespite not being in the picture, Cordelia had her ways of digging out information that concerns her beloved.\n\"I will prepare tea for everyone.\"\nLilia understood that there was going to be a serious discussion in the meeting hall, that's why she went and readied the refreshments first.\nThe others sat on the round table with Kyouki on the head seat and Cordelia on his right. Sicily, as always, took the left seat, where she always belonged.\n\"Kyo-chan. What's with that woman? Her features tell me that she is also from a commoner society, yet the aura she carries surpasses everyone I have ever faced altogether. And the strangest part… Why does she regard Austin as a big brother?\"\nCordelia was stressed about the last part because it reeked of some kind of kink which she might want her Kyo-chan to stay away from.\nHer raven hair which most commoner children get from their parents, made Cordelia believe that Saya was also one of them. But not those eyes.\nThose life-threatening, soul-freezing eyes.\n\"I am not certain about her origin, but she seemed to be Austin's relative, and other than that, she's incredibly strong, that I can say.\"\nKyouki didn't disclose that Saya first met them in Xylex since he didn't trust Cordelia entirely. She has been inside the fortress of Gram for seven years. Who knows what political drama might erupt once the Upper Echelon knows about Saya's summoning and the other heroes?\nSicily also stayed silent and just nodded to support Kyouki's statement.\nCordelia pondered for a long second before she raised her brows and asked in an unsure tone.\n\"How strong are we talking about here?\"\nThere's a possibility that in the future, Cordelia might be standing against Austin as per what she has gotten the intel from Austin's hometown and such. If that were the case, then she better enquire about her potential enemy and his allies.\nKyouki, upon hearing Cordelia's question, thought for a long minute before asking something in context to his response.\n\"Do you know Captain Charles?\"\nCordelia's brows raised as she nodded and answered instantaneously.\n\"The honorary Knight Commander who one-sidedly overwhelmed the War of East. I have never fought him but have witnessed what brutality that man contains.\"\nCharles' name was not only famous in Gram but also in other continents because of the battle he fought against the South Eastern continent while being the sole defender left.\nKyouki leaned his back on the chair as he spoke solemnly.\n\"I also haven't fought Captain Charles. But from my observation… if the whole Gram Royal Order under the command of Sir Charles stand against Saya-san…our nation might become defenseless in a mere half a day.\"\n_____________\n\"...and now just the wait for tomorrow morning.\"\nAfter leaving the meeting room, Austin dropped Saya at Luna's room before he returned to his own, where he awaited his beloved.\nSince she felt it boring to be in the discussion, Luna enjoyed her own company while sipping on the lemon tea.\nAfter he returned Luna heard the brief of what happened in the gathering while sitting in his lap with his arms embracing her in a tight hold.\nStrangely, Luna now loved being hugged like a baby while she heard his heavy yet gentle voice from inches apart. Maybe it was the familial absence she sought from her lover…but whatever it was, Luna felt happy to be held.\n\"This new girl is troublesome. Why don't I go and kill her? You can take her body double inside the labyrinth.\"\nAustin smiled wryly upon such a nonchalant remark as he shook his head in denial.\n\"It's okay. I can handle it if things go South. And her skill doesn't work on mana, to begin with, so she surely would get useful.\"\n\"Unlike me. \"\nAustin's brows raised as he heard her complaining tone before panicking to pamper her.\n\"Everyone has their strength, Luna. You might not be good with combat, but you are the strongest when it comes to mana. So don't belittle yourself.\"\nAustin patted the troubled child when with her cheeks bulging profoundly, Luna grabbed his hand and shouted in annoyance.\n\"Don't pat me to subdue my anger!!\"\nTurning around in a swift motion, she strangled Austin down as she sat on his waist while glaring at him with her cheeks reddening.\n\"You know how it feels to be always useless to you?! I am super mad right now, Austin! Super mad! You know my anger could even burn you at the moment! You might die, so run away from this troublesome me!\"\nIt might be the first time Austin has seen such anger from Luna, which wasn't aimed at him but herself.\nEven Austin was also irritated by his helplessness regarding the matter of the demonic artifact investigation. So he completely understood why she was so upset regarding the matter.\nBut as Luna herself said earlier, they can only do those things which are within their capability. Trying to be helpful in repulse would result in nothing but regrets.\nExtending his hand, Austin held her face before he spoke in a soothing tone.\n\"If death can be so beautiful, I might embrace it with my arms open and a smile on my face.\"\n(A/N: - I know how you guys felt, but endure it.)\nLuna's expression instantly switched as her cheeks loosened at a tremendous rate. With her ear reddening, she plopped her face down on his chest as she mumbled.\n\"Baka…always saying something so embarrassing.\"\nPunching his chest lightly, Luna whined. A grin spread across Austin's lips as he gently caressed Luna's precious hair.\nThe two didn't speak for a long time. Only feeling each others' presence while enjoying the warmth which they forbade to share with anyone else, Luna and Austin spent their peaceful moments in the way which seemed best for them.\nAfter some minutes, Luna called for Austin in a soft whisper.\n\"Say, darling.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nAfter a slight pause, Luna concluded her words, albeit a little hesitant along the way.\n\"After yo-you return from the Labyrinth…let's get married, okay?\"\n_______________\nA/N: - Shame on you, Austin. She proposed first.\nDrop a comment if you liked the chapter~",

      "content": "Last night, Austin stayed awake until the sun didn't start reflecting his and Luna's naked body, muddled into each other like they were glued with an unbeatable seal.\nAnd that was inside a time barrier that Luna made to slow down the period by half an hour. Before she fell into a slumber of deep exhaustion, she broke the barrier with her remaining energy.\nAustin wasn't able to sleep much due to the words Luna spoke or the way she wept many times across the night. He somehow managed to coax her but made a mental note about what should be done first, after returning from the labyrinth.\nAmidst his contemplation and partial drowsiness, Austin heard two knocks on his door before his eyes instantly shot open.\nGetting out of the comforter without letting the princess wake up, Austin draped a shirt over his shoulder with a pair of boxers on his lower body.\nHe didn't bother buttoning up since he knew the person on the other side was familiar enough to mind such things.\n*CLICK**\n\"Morning, Saya.\"\n\"Good morning Onii-.....\"\nSaya's words trailed off as her gaze fell on Austin's body which held every muscle at the exact point which could excite a woman. Not to talk about the red and blue bruises, which display how wild play must have taken place last night.\nBeing stared at like that, Austin became conscious of the hickeys Luna planted all over his body last night before he turned around and invited Saya inside.\n\"Sorry for the display, sister. Come in. I will make some tea. \"\n\"Ah..\"\nSaya wanted to complain since she definitely liked what she saw, but that would be too shameless if she suddenly begged her Onii-sama to let her ogle at him.\nAustin guided Saya to the round tea table as he went to boil water and excused Luna's current condition.\nSaya didn't mind since, looking at Luna's peaceful sleeping face, she could somehow understand how tired she was to sleep such soundly.\nWhile pouring the tea leaves, Austin's voice again reached up to the raven-haired beauty, but this time, his voice contained a bit of profoundness.\n\"I want you to promise me something, Saya.\"\nThe listener also became serious as she saw Austin walking back with a tray containing two tea sets over it. Saya stood up and took the tray from him before Austin nodded and sat back on the chair.\nAs Saya poured milk into each cup and added sugar, she heard her brother resuming.\n\"If any situation arises where you get the chance to save any one life of yourself or any of the three of us, you have to promise you'll run away without even considering a second option.\"\nSaya's eyes widened as she sat facing her brother while pondering why he suddenly brought up such a matter. She was strong enough to protect her Onii-sama from any danger, then why…\nBut even in a case, something like what Onii-sama spoke really does happen, Saya would probably save her brother without even thinking a blink.\nHow could she promise something which she couldn't fulfill?\n\"I have my ways to come back from death, my dear sister. So, don't think uselessly and say you promise.\"\nHolding her hand dearly, Austin caressed her cheeks, making the latter blush as she felt like getting cornered by her brother's unfair persuasion.\nClosing her eyes shut, she utters her words in between the warm shivers she felt down her spine due to the sensation she felt on her face.\n\"O-okay, I promise.\"\n\"Good~.\"\nAustin pulled back his hand, leaving a wobbly Saya behind as she lay back on the chair while panting as she had gone through a marathon.\nShe just couldn't take this aggressive Onii-sama of hers!\n_____________\nNearly at half past nine, both of them finished their chats and sipped on another serving of tea before Austin went to freshen up.\nAustin talked about some of the things he had thought regarding the labyrinth and precautions they might take according to the situation.\nSaya also gave her speculation and listened to everything her brother had to advise.\n\"Okay, then. You go ahead and wait for me in the dining hall.\"\nSaya bowed before she departed from Austin's room and went to arrange breakfast for the two.\nAustin took a short bath before he changed his clothes into a black shirt and a free-size high-waist pair of black pants. His feet were covered with high boots and a special kind of white gloves on his hand, with a sapphire stone planted in the center.\nTying his long-grown hair in a short bun, he felt annoyed with some strands which weren't getting pinned in one place at all, so he left them hanging over his forehead.\nStepping out of the dressers, he first felt a hot gaze peeking at him up to down.\nWalking to his cupboard, Austin spoke in a gentle tone.\n\"You woke up? Sorry for being noisy.\"\nAustin grabbed some sets of his clothes and started packing them in a bag. He doesn't like to put anything which he wears and eats in inventory since there are some nasty things stored inside.\nWell, he does have emergency backup kept in the system storage, but until it doesn't come down to that, Austin prefers fresh apparel and nourishment.\nAustin's movement suddenly halted as a pair of pale yet beautiful hands circled around his waist before he felt a familiar fragrance wafting around him.\nThe warmth on his back undoubtedly belonged to the woman who had the capability to sneak behind him without getting noticed.\n\"You sure going to dive in that Labyrinth but not on a date with some bitchy woman? What's with this dangerous look?\"\nAustin didn't actually have many ideas when it came to dressing up and all, so Luna's compliments always made him perplexed.\n\"You think so? Well, I can dress up like this for you, too, if you want.\"\nAustin suggested as he finished packing and turned around to look at his favorite eyes. Hugging her waist, Austin leaned on the cupboard as he saw Luna standing there stark naked.\nIt was getting up worked up; where to keep his eyes when he heard her seductive voice.\n\"Something which no one can see my Austin in. I love your birth suit more than anything.\"\nSaying so, Luna brought her hand to tuck his hair which was giving him a dangerously attractive look as she spoke in her previous tone.\n\"I can't say sissy words like stay safe or eat regularly. What I want is for you to return to me alive and healthy. This is not a plea Master Austin but a demand from your future wife.\"\nAustin raised his left brow upon hearing such assertive words from her before he circled his arm around her waist and pulled her to lean upon his body.\n\"And you too. Dare to put yourself in danger, and I will spank your ass until it doesn't remember the size of my palm, you understand?\"\nLuna didn't reply but, with a smirk, stared at his eyes intently while she received the same approach from him.\nAmidst steamy silence, both of them suddenly burst into soft giggles as their heads leaned upon each other.\nHow aggressively they tried to mask, they couldn't hide how hard it was for both of them to get separated.\nWith her eyes filling with moisture, Luna spoke with a soft whisper.\n\"Come back as soon as possible, darling. I am so going to miss you.\"\n\"Mm. Will do.\"\n______________\nA/N: -I hate to separate them, but the plot needs to move.

      "content": "Around eleven in the morning, the group of four who were going to dive into the labyrinth, along with the headmaster Merlin, the other two members of Hero's Party, and Princess Tiara, gathered at the head office.\nKyouki, along with his three friends, had already reported an hour early. Only Austin and Saya arrived at the last minute.\nStanding at the center of the room, Merlin didn't engage in conversation as per what Austin requested and went to commence the unsealing process while the others witnessed in silence.\nThe art of ancient magic was genuinely magnificent, on which even Austin hadn't gotten his reach. Drawing every circle physically through mana while chanting the spell was a sight to home a memory in the audience's mind.\nAmidst the silence, the pretty blonde girl whispered in Austin's ear without turning her gaze.\n\"Strange not to see, Luna-san here.\"\nAustin raised his brows since it was the first time Tiara talked about Luna to him. In the same whispering tone, he replied truthfully.\n\"The last thing I would want to see before diving in is to see her saddened face; that's why I asked her to stay back.\"\nAustin was sure that Luna would grieve or even cry if she saw him jumping in the labyrinth, and that scene might weigh him down and his future decisions.\nThe best course of action was to not take Luna with him, and the latter also preferred the same since she also knew how hopeless Luna becomes when Austin gets involved in dangerous things.\nDespite speaking in an incomplete phrase, Tiara understood clearly why Luna didn't come. And by no means was she pleased to hear that. Well, it was good that the Saintess left Austin for Tiara for some moments, but what made her pout was Austin's concern was directed only to Luna!\nShe was also dying of anxiety since she realized how she helped Austin get the permit of the Abyss. Not in a hundred years would she want to let Austin descend into that hell hole, but now the ship has already left the port.\nNow what she could do is to pray for his well-being and beg her god that he returns safely to her.\n**SHWISH**\nWith a whipping sound, the center of the room started disintegrating, with seven purple stones illuminating from different corners.\nThose stones are the artifacts that Headmaster Merlin himself developed to strengthen the sealing magic. Everyone believes that the Barricade Grandmaster has drawn over the labyrinth is powerful enough not to break by even a Mythic Rank demon.\nBut well, that's just a rumor since some weeks ago, the seals were broken, and no High-Rank entity ever entered the Academy's premises.\n'Woah… '\nKyouki's eyes went round as he saw the never-ending darkness dug just at the place which was vacant some moments ago. It truly gave the sensation of an Abyss, sending shivers down the spine of almost everyone inside the room.\nEven Saya gulped in slight fret since she wasn't much good with darkness, and being in a situation where her Onii-sama would be watching her, made the woman restless.\n\"Okay then, Headmaster. I don't know how long we would be out, but on my way back, I would make sure to bring souvenirs.\"\nWith those words, Austin jumped inside only after he held his little sister's hand, much to the latter's astonishment.\n\"Don't use levitation since it won't…\nAustin's shout trailed off since it seemed he had already reached a certain depth.\nThe expression on the others' faces reflected nothing but shock as they witnessed such a careless approach of Austin, or maybe he was too confident?\n\"Kyou-kun, here. \"\nSicily suddenly took out something from her pouch and tied it around Kyouki's neck.\nLifting the small pearl at the adjoining point, Kyouki didn't have to ask before Sicily cleared his confusion.\n\"It's a family treasure that father asked me to delegate to you. He said, 'At times of darkness, this stone shall help you seek the right path. ' \"\nKyouki nodded with a serious expression before he thanked the girl who had her eyes red forever he could remember. The same was for Lilia, who had been crying like a child even though Kyouki tried his best to coax her.\nGiving a final hug of farewell to both, Kyouki was called by Headmaster as he saw the bearded mage extending a ring to him.\n\"This is a Spatial Storage ring that contains things you might find helpful inside the Abyss. Feed it your blood, and it will connect to your soul. \"\nKyouki was surprised to receive such valuable gifts from both as he took the gold ring from Merlin.\nAfter collecting his thought, Kyouki clenched his fist before he held Cordelia's hand. With a resolute nod, he spoke in a confident tone.\n\"I will not let these invaluable blessings go to waste. Okay, then. I will see you guys in a bit. \"\nGlancing again at Sicily and Lilia, Kyouki fell inside the hole with his hand connected to his friend in a tight hold.\nThe sizzling blizzards, along with an ominous sensation, spread through both of their consciousness as their body traveled at a controllable pace downwards.\nStraightening their bodies, they gathered the remaining mana in their feet since, as Austin said, this place indeed suppressed their magical resource like a precious part of them was eaten out.\n**DHAK**\nAfter falling for more than ten seconds, Cordelia and Kyouki landed safely on the ground only to get stunned by sight, which emerged almost spontaneously.\nWith their grip on each other growing stiffer, they saw the rise of a being whom, despite being aware, they couldn't help but shiver upon witnessing.\n[You mere mortal dared to enter my domain!]\n____________…\nA/N: - This labyrinth would bring out many secrets and mysteries which would connect to the future and origin of Austin.\nWell, let's see where this goes~",

      "content": "[You mere mortals dare to enter my domain!]\nWith their body growing stiff and breathing choked in their throat, what welcomed Cordelia and Kyouki was a massive reptilian creature.\nJust by its outer appearance, Kyouki could discern how tough it would be to penetrate those massive scales. Not to talk about the fatal thin whipping tail, slithering at a corner alertly.\nIts golden eyes seemed to peek just inside their souls as Kyouki studied as much as he could in fractions of seconds, before letting go of Cordelia.\n\"Back off and assist me from the shadows.\"\nCordelia wasn't an amateur to remain in a daze for long. Hearing Kyouki's words, she wanted to protest, but soon she understood why he asked her so.\nNodding, she gave his hand a last squeeze before her body got covered in black smog, camouflaging her with the background.\nThe creature didn't move since it detected the human standing cautiously in front would strike, if it went after the human girl.\n[That essence… Aren't you a Hero? Excellent ~ It would be the first time to have some holy flesh.]\nThe serpent moved steadily while eyeing Kyouki head to toe. The essence inside a human glowed most peculiarly and had the mana which shone the brightest.\nThe serpent queen hasn't encountered a God before, but that doesn't mean she doesn't have a record of those who carry their will.\nThose who receive blessings of Omnipotent beings are naturally strong to the point even the Serpent Queen hesitated to approach blindly.\nBut at the end of the day, this human Hero also relies on the same thing which others did.\nMana.\n**HISSSS**\nWith a swift movement, the creature moved toward Kyouki with its mouth parted and four needle-sharp fangs protruding dangerously at the front.\nKyouki didn't have to enhance himself to dodge such a front-on attack, so he did. Using the strength in his hind limbs, Kyouki jumped back at a more remarkable speed as he unsheathed his sword mid-air.\nThe snake narrowed its gaze in mockery as its head was just a ploy since the actual attack was to be blown from its tail, approaching Kyouki's back.\n\"Not so easy….\"\n**SLING**\nKyouki anticipated such a thing, as without even turning his body, he swung his sword in a precise slash and detached the creature's tail from its massive body.\n**KHEEK**\nThe creature screeched in annoyance as purple blood gushed out from where its tail was previously. Regrowing its body part would be easy, but the troublesome human wasn't waiting at all.\n\"[Heaven's Judgment]\"\nKyouki raised his sword, which was illuminating like a small sun by now, as he jumped toward the serpent queen at a furious pace.\nThe monster tried to move away from the trajectory when it felt its body glued to the ground, or rather its shadow was?\n\"You think I will let you get away?\"\nCordelia shouted from a corner with her hand planted on the ground, and using Kyouki's blinding light; she trapped the Serpent's shadow in her hold.\nThe creature didn't bother trying to move anymore since it concluded the strength behind the weird Spell. There was only one remaining option, and that was to counter the Human Hero.\n[Don't be full of yourself!]\nWith agitation filling the Queen's voice, it parted its mouth before a purple ball generated within a second before the creature released the giant sphere toward Kyouki.\nCordelia's eyes went wide since, in that proximity, Kyouki couldn't have dodged the attack, but suddenly a whip of air slashed the purple orb like a sharp knife cutting a fruit.\nBefore Cordelia could have searched for the chanter, who helped Kyouki just now, a defeating sound resonated in the labyrinth signifying that the Great Sword of Light Hero had met its prey.\nThe creature's massive head was split into two with Kyouki's attack, with life leaving its body at a threatening gait.\n**DHAK**\nCordelia let go of the hold, before the massive body of the Giant Snake lifelessly fell to the ground with the radiance of its eyes, disappearing into nothingness.\n\"Kyo-chan! Are you alright?!\"\nIn a panic, Cordelia rushed towards the place where still the smog of venom fermented profoundly.\nThere stood a handsome young warrior wielding his sword in a relaxed grip and his robust body covered in his enemy's blood.\nThe sight was marvelous enough to throw Cordelia into a stupor, but first, she had to check on her friend.\n\"Yeah, I am fine. What about you?\"\nTaking out clean clothes from his pouch Kyouki started wiping his face when Cordelia took the job and snatched the clothing from him.\nWiping gently, she answered him in a soothing tone.\n\"I am good, but my heart is racing. When did my silly Kyo-chan become this strong?\"\nKyouki became embarrassed being complimented as he scratched the back of his head after letting go of his sword, which was planted on the ground.\n\"Indeed remarkable, Hero. As Saya said, you really have become stronger from the last time I remember.\"\nFrom a distance, a voice approached them, but since the voice was familiar, neither of them became cautious.\n\"Couldn't you have come out of the shadows a little early?\"\nContinuing to wipe her friend clean, Cordelia spoke in a grumpy tone since she didn't like how her Kyo-chan was put into danger right off the bat.\n\"It's okay, Lia. Austin has supported me enough to let me have the victory.\"\nKyouki spoke with a sigh because, due to his haste, he didn't think such an attack could be reciprocated by the serpent. If not for the wind slash Austin threw at such a crucial moment, the result might have varied.\nCordelia didn't say anything but pouted since she still felt it was unfair to let Kyouki do everything. He might have gotten hurt there.\n\"It's just as you said, Onii-sama. The venom is almost similar, and so is its taste.\"\nFrom a different side, Saya also walked to the group she brought to the small pouch containing the venom of the same snake but collected at different times.\nAs Saya handed the pouches, Cordelia and Kyouki looked at the blond youth in perplexion, trying to find something plausible.\nWith a thin smirk, Austin looked at the bags as he muttered under his breath.\n\"So we were indeed inside a game and just cleared the first level, eh…\n_____________…\nA/N: - Drop a comment and stay safe ✌️",

      "content": "\"Wait. Let me get this straight. That snake was the monster who engulfed Sicily, and you already killed it on your last visit?\"\nWith a look of disbelief, Kyouki asked in an uncertain voice after he heard Austin's story of the time when Sicily was entrapped in the Labyrinth.\nCordelia also had the same expression, except for the fact that she didn't trust him entirely. From what she heard from Austin, it seemed he alone subjugated the Serpent Queen, but Cordelia had another opinion on that matter.\n\"Have you guys played games? Which have levels?\"\nChoosing not to answer the hero's curiosity since it was needless, Austin asked something out of nowhere, making Cordelia and Kyouki even more baffled.\n\"Level? I don't know about it, but sure, we have played games back in town.\"\nKyouki answered as he glanced at Cordelia, who was nodding in agreement. Back in his birthplace, he, Cordelia, and many other kids loved to play demon and Hero.\nBut what confused them was this foreign word called 'Level' included in-game. Fortunately, Austin made it more straightforward this time for them to understand.\n\"Let's imagine that you and I are two different players, who, despite diving in the same game, fight the same monster, yet separately. Well, it's natural for players to go through obstacles in-game, but what about real life? How was that thing slithering around when I killed it some weeks ago?\"\nComplete silence befell on the floor as Austin muttered those words, much to Cordelia and Kyouki's astonishment. They somehow understood what Austin tried to interpret, yet it seemed utterly implausible.\nAnd not only that. Even Saya verified that both venoms belonging to the creature Austin killed some time ago, and the venom of the snake Kyouki cornered to death are the same.\nThere was no room to deny that the Reptilian Queen was one, yet she got killed twice.\n\"Onii-sama…if it really is like a game..then this floor would be….\"\nRising to his feet, Austin took the lead and completed his sister's words.\n\"Indeed, we just cleared level one.\"\nThrowing the venom pouches into his inventory, Austin looked at the two perplexed beings who still were trying to discern everything which Austin spoke.\n\"You guys. Have you taken the Mana Suppression Pills with you?\"\nHearing Austin's query, Kyouki searched inside his pouch before he took out a small bag that contained a dozen of small orange candies-like balls.\nMana-suppressing balls, were something that was required for anyone other than Austin. The system possessing youth could suppress his mana through the system features but not the others.\nThe Pills Kyouki just showed temporarily represses mana for those who can't handle it. Some people buy those pills because of their axis mana reserve, which they can't control.\nSince it becomes excruciating for mana users to even walk in the labyrinth, Austin asked Saya, Cordelia, and Kyouki to take at least a bunch since a single Mana suppressing ball works for 12 hours. Not more, not less.\n\"Good. Now let's see where's the entrance to the next level.\"\nTurning his gaze away, Austin chanted a small fireball over his head which dispersed into several amber pearls and distributed around the hall.\nSince all of them were superhuman, visibility to a certain distance was possible, but for scouting, they needed assistance.\nStrangely, Austin wasn't able to find anything at all; even his vision was circulating profoundly along with his fireballs, and so were his senses.\n\"Onii-sama. I think it's beneath us… \"\nHearing Saya's call, who currently had her hand touching the ground, Austin frowned slightly.\n\"You sure? I searched underground but didn't catch anything.\"\n\"I am not entirely certain, but I do feel there's or to say there are several entities beneath us.\"\nAustin raised his brows with astonishment and pride, pumping his chest. More than his limitation of Detection skills, he felt extremely delighted to see how wonderful his sister has grown up to.\n\"Good job there. Nii-chan is very proud of Saya.\"\nSince she was kneeling on the ground for surveillance, she was caught off guard by her Onii-sama, who suddenly started caressing her head while saying those fluffy words.\nGrinning toothly, Saya let herself get patted as she leaned on his leg like a kitten and rubbed her face to show her elation.\n\"I again want to ask…what is their relationship?\"\nCordelia, with her facial expression growing weird, asked Kyouki in a stiff whisper, to which the latter just shook his head.\nKyouki was himself flabbergasted to see such a sight of the woman who had gotten the title of Thorn Lady in the Academy and whatnot. He just couldn't align the image of Saya being a professor and Saya being a silly sister.\n\"Hmm… Let's see. Under this floor, huh….\"\nAs Austin moved forward, Saya stood up and followed her brother. The other two also got out of their daze and started following the others.\n\"Everyone. Stick to the walls. I am going to be rough here.\"\nWithout turning back, Austin spoke in a loud tone before he pulled out something from his inventory which made the others wide-eyed.\n**DHAK**\nIt was a massive sledgehammer of almost 30 meters in length and had cylindrical faces of a diameter of nearly 5 meters. The handle of the hammer was incredibly long if compared to its head.\nThe striking upper part was made of a black material which had golden pearls engraved at its border, making it look like some kind of showpiece, but no one dared to assume it such.\nThe handle was wholly made of standard wood, or so it seemed, with a width that seemed impossible to grip comfortably in human hands.\nSoon Austin took out two red and black gloves from his pouch, which were also an artifact he got rewarded from the system not so long ago.\n\"Onii-sama…I think it won't take that much force….\"\nSaya didn't want her Onii-sama to do such a tedious thing when she had that much confidence to blow out his obstacle all by herself.\nBut her brother's following words made Saya realize something she nearly forgot because of her naivety.\n\"This Labyrinth is already creepy enough to make me intrigued. If something comes out upon smashing the floor, this hammer will negate its effect to a certain extent. So relax, my Imouto, and let your brother handle this.\"\nSaya wanted to say something but decided not to since she might become a nuisance to him. Nodding, she stepped back and gave her brother some space.\n\"Let's go, Kyo-chan. That thing looks dangerous to be around.\"\nCordelia muttered as she held her friend's hand. Kyouki nodded with his gaze still fixed on the hammer, which somehow felt like it was inviting him, but Kyouki didn't move on with his urges and followed Cordelia.\n\"Okay then…\"\nThe gloves simply suppress backlashes and enlarge the user's palm according to the weapon they are looking to wield.\nAs strange as it sounds, this creation of dwarves might minimize someone's hand if they have the urge to fight with needles.\nGripping the handle with his extra large hands, Austin levitates in the air using some portion of his suppressed mana.\nReaching up to a height of almost fifty meters, Austin brought the hammer over his head before he channeled magical energy into the tool and also , his body, so he didn't collapse with the strike.\nInhaling deeply, he once again checked everyone's position and concluded that they were at a safe distance.\n\"Okay then. Let's see what you can do buddy… \"\n______________….\nA/N: - Pace good or should I escalate?\nLemme know in the comments~",

      "content": "As the heavens breaking sound resonated with the heavy impact, Austin bestowed on the surface, everything around the vicinity turned into dust.\nThe three who were standing close to the wall, felt their stance quaking at a furious pace before it disintegrated due to Austin's strike.\nCordelia used her Shadow Skill to stick herself and Kyouki to the wall and make their fall steadier to the next level. Saya didn't use mana and just let herself go with the flow since she wanted to follow her brother as closely as possible.\nAlong with heavy rubles of the whole floor, the four humans fell for more than half a minute, this time before Austin and Saya landed on something tough, unlike the other two, who were still descending.\nPutting the sledgehammer back in the inventory, both of them didn't have to look much around to find the obstacle of this level.\n\"Fuck! Kyo-chan, jump!!\"\nHearing Cordelia, Kyouki didn't even ponder before he gathered strength in his legs and using the wall as a launch pad, Kyouki, along with his friend, jumped toward Austin's direction at a booming speed.\nThe reason why Cordelia panicked was the things that were waiting for the two at the base of the side walls. If it was only some regular creature, Cordelia could have handled it by herself.\nBut those many…?\n\"Archanian spiders? But what's with that size and population?\"\nKyouki muttered under his breath as he studied the ten-legged creatures staring at the group from every direction with unmoving red predatory eyes.\nArchany monsters are those who contain one of the deadliest poisons in them, and spiders are the ones most commonly found.\nThe monsters around them indeed looked like the ones found in the wilderness, but their size was a little too huge to believe. Normal spiders are about the size of dogs in Austin's past life but the current ones were more like bulls.\n\"Hey, guys. Look above.\"\nOn Austin's call, the other three instinctively tilted their necks to see the place where they came from, only to get startled in the end.\n\"N-No way…\"\nContrary to their expectation, the ground that Austin broke and led them to the next stage has been rebuilt for some reason. And not only that. There were hundreds of eyes glaring down at the human group.\n**GULP**\n\"What should we do, team leader?\"\nWith a strong gulp, Cordelia raised her query without turning her gaze from her surroundings in fear of getting attacked any second now.\n\"Now what? We will fight, of course.\"\n\"Come forth, Kamikurai.\"\n(A/N: - Kaminari 雷+ Kurai 暗い= Dark Lightning)\nJust as Austin finished speaking, Saya summoned her katana, bringing every attention to her.\nThe slim weapon had sparkling raven thunders dancing on its blade, with its long handle being held by its owner in a rigid stance. The whole blade was the size of one and a half meters, with an ominous chill extruding the entire thing.\n**SWISH**\nTaking the liberty of her brother's words, Saya launched to her front before ascending the air up to ten meters as she charged her blade.\nLightning started violently covering her whole body before she held the handle with both hands and landed in the middle of the horde of spiders.\n\"Die!\"\nWith those words, the tip of the blade landed on one of the archany spiders, killing it instantly before the heavy raven lightning transmitted through the others, too, and burnt them to cinders.\n**KHEEEEEEEK**\nA heavy screeching voice resonated as, within a single strike, almost two dozen of monsters were annihilated.\n\"Tch.\"\nSaya clicked her tongue since she was expecting a little more from that attack, but nevertheless, she didn't halt there.\n\"Fuee…. My sister really is something. \"\nPraising his little sister after witnessing her brute strength and remarkable technique, Austin also summoned his blade, which, unlike Saya's, contained a bright blaze.\nHis weapon was also a sword, except for the fact that in place of sharp wedges, Austin had more like saw-sculptured steel welded. It was almost three meters in total length with its blade, almost a meter in width.\n\"Hell blaze.\"\nAs Austin initiated one of the blade's skills, a bright amber shade spread on the weapon, covering the sharpness and providing a threatening add-on to the sword.\n\"Don't die, hero.\"\nWith those words, Austin also left the two before he dashed in a different direction from his sister. Soon loud screams and the severe smell of burning toxins fermented profoundly.\nEven though only two humans have engaged in battle, the war cries became so piercing that they shook the skies and the ground, giving a threatening chill to Kyouki.\n\"K-Kyo-chan? Your eyes looks scary for some reasons.\"\nCordelia was taken aback as she saw the fierce look in her beloved's eyes as he gazed at the battlefield. That aggression in his eyes. The blood lust he portrayed crossed all the images of the innocent Kyouki she had.\nTaking the legendary sword in his grip, Kyouki made a stance as he spoke in a confident tone.\n\"Let me show you how much I have changed, Lia.\"\n_____________…\nA/N: - It's been a while since I wrote a short chapter. I will wrap up the floor relatively fast since what's important is the center of this labyrinth.\nLet's see where this goes~",

      "content": "It's been an hour since the terrifying battle commenced between four humans and countless ten-legged creatures—an hour of the total one-sided massacre.\nThe air has become entirely intoxicated to the point that even a breath could kill hundreds of manaless humans. Not only that, even amateur mana users could get choked to death due to the overcrowding of such dense pollution.\nCompared to the previous floor where Kyouki fought the Serpent Queen, this floor was massive enough to let the four, fight to their heart's content without being cornered. They also kept their distance from others in check, so they didn't stray carelessly in the heat of the battle.\nCordelia was the only person who still hadn't ascended in the battle frenzy mode, and she was the only one having difficulties keeping up with the number of enemies emerging at such an alarming rate.\nUsing the Unique Grade daggers she received from the Capital, she eradicated the spiders and utilized her shadow skills against those who attacked from her blind spot.\nUnlike the others, she didn't have any long weapons, which she was regretting at the moment.\n\"Look at them. What training they have gone through….'\nLooking at distant places from where several big explosions and lightning thunders flared up, she thought about how much she had overestimated herself.\n\"Look out!! \"\n**SLIIING**\n*KHEEK**\nTo her utter astonishment, Kyouki appeared out of nowhere as his blade bisected one of the spiders heading toward Cordelia from above.\nCovered in blood, both stood face to face after Kyouki helped his friend to get up.\n\"I-I…\nCordelia stuttered in a fret blended with shame since, due to her carelessness, her beloved had to get out of his way to help her. And some minutes ago, she was dreaming of doing something like that.\nThe day couldn't go any worse than this!\n\"It's okay, Lia. Don't worry. I have got your back.\"\nKyouki brought his hand to Cordelia's cheek as he tried to calm her down when they had the small window to chat.\nThere were spiders in thousands of numbers around, but it would take time to approach these two humans.\nAs Kyouki expected, Cordelia sobered up as she stared at his eyes for a long second before she responded in a resolute tone.\n\"Thanks for the support, Kyo-chan. I won't disappoint you again.\"\nSaying so, Cordelia extended her hand and called for her daggers which had been previously thrown somewhere with her fall.\nKyouki nodded with a smile before the two continued fighting, but this time in closer proximity to keep close eyes on each other.\nOn the other side, Saya was on a rampage to quench her bloodthirst. She wasn't just slaying the monster. Saya concluded the spiders' existence in the most brutal way, a human could ever is capable of.\nShe fought monsters, but if looked closely, there wasn't anyone bigger monster on the battlefield than her.\n\"Everyone retreat to the center right now.\"\nSuddenly Saya, as well as the other two, halted in their movements as they heard Austin's voice resonating in their mind. Cordelia glanced at Kyouki, upon which the latter nodded with a frown before they cleared their surroundings and leaped back to the place from where they had started.\nSaya also did the same, but her agility was somewhat immeasurable since she thought that her brother might have gotten hurt.\nBut to her utter relief, Austin was standing there, all healthy and unscathed, without a stain of blood over him at all.\n\"Sorry for the unsightly appearance Onii-sama.\"\nSaya blushed upon seeing herself, all covered in blood and gore, unlike her brother, who was still as majestic as ever. Well, seeing her brother sweaty and covered in the same shade as hers would have been erotic too, but by no means would she say that.\n\"Don't be. It's a battlefield, so treat this blood as your ornaments and be proud.\"\nSaya smiled heartily as she felt elated being praised by her brother every time.\nSoon Kyouki and Cordelia also landed at the center, which was the most vacant place available at the moment. The spiders have detected the movement of their prey, but it would take at least twenty seconds to reach the group.\nAs soon they stepped in a certain range, Austin broke something which was in his hand, before a white smoke covered all of the four, astonishing the new arrives.\n\"This… ?\"\nAs Kyouki asked, he saw the spiders, which were previously charging in their direction, were now frozen statues at their place.\n\"It's a time-freezing barrier that would last for five minutes. I thought some of you might need a breather before we continue.\"\nAustin glanced at the panting Cordelia, who, upon being watched, became flustered and stood straight to pretend that she was fine.\nKyouki felt guilty for not noticing his friend's struggle and bringing her to such a spot.\n\"First, nourish yourself with mana until you guys have time.\"\nUpon hearing Austin, the other three, along with the speaker himself, channeled mana through their pores. The effect of the Mana-suppressing pill is consistent, but not until the user himself tries to break through.\n(A/N: - This breaking-the-pill effect is only possible in low grades pills not the higher ones.)\nThe need to nourish someone with mana was fundamental. Superhumans' life essence is their magical energy. Suppressing it for long might hamper them, so until they get the time it would be beneficial to shower themselves with the essence.\n\"These things aren't decreasing at all.\"\nMuttering under her breath, Cordelia surveyed the vicinity and shivered upon sensing the number, which seemed to be multiplying with time.\n\"Indeed, they won't end until you don't burn it.\"\nEvery attention was gathered on the blond youth before he continued with his explanation.\n\"These things regenerate from even a simple fang, so cutting them wouldn't be sufficient. And without mana, you guys can't use fire magic, right?\"\nThe others leaned their face downward since it was true for what all Austin spoke. And the vulnerability of spiders, he concluded, was observed by the other three, too; that's why they didn't argue with Austin.\n\"Onii-sama. My black lightning can….\"\nSaya seemed to take charge of bringing hell into the labyrinth, but Austin shook his head and spoke in a blatant tone.\n\"No, it won't, Saya. They are at least five thousand in number, and I have studied your sword skills. It won't do.\"\nSaya bit her lips as she realized what her brother said was true and blamed herself for being such a useless little sister.\nAustin sighed upon seeing his dejected sister and decided to coax her afterward.\n'I might have spoken a little harsh….'\n\"Austin. What about me? I am confident in my blessing to annihilate this lot by myself.\"\nClutching his sword, Kyouki spoke in a poised tone only to get rejected by the latter.\n\"Nope. Save your energy, for now, hero. I might need that in a later situation.\"\nKyouki wanted to say something, but knowing his limitations, the hero could only grit his teeth and again let himself rely on his greatest rival.\nThrowing his weapon back in inventory, Austin cracked his knuckles and neck before he called out for others.\n\"Just as the barrier vanishes, don't dare to leave my side.\"\n_______________..\nA/N: - Should I continue from this spot or skim through it and express the event in the monologue?\nComment down your opinions~",

      "content": "[Cordelia's POV:]\nAlong with my orders to work as an escort of the emerging asset of Gram, known as Austin, I was instructed to keep various things in check while I would be venturing into the Abyss.\nThe two key terms which I was being majorly drilled about were:\nFirst, I have to give my full support, without holding back, to the subject since he is far more important than me at the moment. I was even told to sacrifice myself if it helps Austin.\nI was okay with that since, despite my grudges against Austin, I was, first and foremost, a patriot who would do everything for my nation's development and prosperity.\nThe second thing I ordered was to keep an eye on him and report what the nation was still unaware about.\nAustin miraculously has shown such growth and prowess, which even defies the existence of Seven Deities. Someone, from being a bastard child to a war hero, is a bit stretched to believe but evident enough not to regard it as bullshit.\nAnd the fact he possesses such heavenly artifacts and weaponry is a mystery in itself. I know Prince Mikhail and Your Majesty aren't involved in this, but there are people in the upper echelon who are after Austin's arsenal.\nThey want him as a tool and snatch away all his priceless inventory. Well, not something I appreciate, but I don't have enough empathy to let the person know how his own nation is plotting against him.\nNow when I have spent hours in the labyrinth with the man who has made a fool out of my Kyo-chan before, I came to discover various things about him.\nFirst, Austin can use time and space magic. Well, he used a Time oriented barrier through an artifact, but no one can convince me that he doesn't have proficiency in Space Magic.\nHe has taken those many things out of nowhere which none of the spatial pouch or storage could contain. That proves he has Infinite Space in his control. It might be a little too much to estimate from a teenager, but that's the only conclusion I could land upon.\nThe second thing I have speculated about this singularity is that he has a weird relationship with the battle maniac named Saya, who's on the second list of investigations. Whatever their relationship is, I have sensed an impenetrable defense that both have for each other.\nEven though Austin doesn't show, he's pretty possessive of his sister in a way and vice versa. I could barely keep up with this weird piece of siblings.\nAnd the last thing which I would like to report as soon as possible:\n'Fuck! He can use spiritual tongue?!'\nMy eyes went wide in shock and fretted as I witnessed the man who once I thought to be nothing more than an over-evaluated youngster who had gained some reputation, displaying something unbelievable.\nAfter Austin told us not to leave his side, we three decided to stick together as Austin ascended in the air just when the barrier was about to lose its effect.\nI clearly heard him talking in a particular language, which has been known since Ancient times but has yet to find a proper user.\nAnd here he was…\nAlive and strong.\nLike an endless mirage who becomes higher as long as you stare at him.\n____________\nAustin has incredible efficiency with Fire Spirit. After all, he's a mage who unlocked his fire element when he was only three years old, and spirits like if someone binds with them before the age of blessings.\nAustin wasn't sure why it was such, but it seemed his transmigration had helped him burn his inner flames quite early in age and led him to connect with these tiny creatures yet to be discovered entirely.\nSpirits aren't such beings that depend on the favorability of the surroundings or the condition of nature. They could be present inside the deepest hell and greatest heavens.\nSo to talk with those little fiery things inside the labyrinth was equally convenient as it was on the surface.\n'First, let's take precaution…'.\nHe knew that his squadmates could resist heat to a certain extent, but sometimes while using Spiritual Energy, Austin tends to go beyond what's needed.\nUsing some portion of his natural mana, he chanted a thick wall around the three, which had much tenacity to receive a single blow from him.\nSaya had her eyes fixated on her brother as she witnessed the glory of the god she worships.\n[XXXX-XX-XXXX-XXX]\nWith a set of commands, Austin requested the fire spirits to gather around and assist him in cleaning this floor. The small souls also didn't hesitate since they were pretty fond of the human to ignore his plea.\nAustin felt the heavy surge of energy being directed at him in such a rapid state that it might break him down; if not, he charges it to his targets.\nJust as rhe barriers disintegrated, the massacre commenced.\n**SWIIISH**\n**KHEEEEEEEEEEEEKKK**\nA massive wave of flames which unlike normal fire contained enough combustion to break even a Terror Ranked demon's skin to cinders, was directed at the archanian spiders.\nAmidst of ear bleeding cries and screams of agony, the smell of poison burning fermented profoundly in the air, making Austin nearly choke up.\n[XXX-XXXXXX-XX]\nHurriedly calling for the Wind spirits, Austin created a windshield for the group standing beneath him. And now, when he has taken the help of Wind Spirits already he added their strength to the flames and created several massive typhoons.\n**SWOOOOOSH**\n**HIIIIICKKK!!\"\nThe place was a living hell.\nDeath was rolling like a breeze in the air. Hundreds of lives were ceasing to exist every second. The blend of pure colorless air around the vicinity has been tainted with the hue of blood.\nIt indeed was a sight that could make weak hearts faint in fear and someone like Luna marveled at the scene in awe.\n\"I wonder what you might have been doing.\"\n_____________….\nA/N: - Next chapter would be from her side and the latter half from the labyrinth. Spiritual energy would be elaborate with time, and I will try to detail the construction, which I forgot initially.\nDrop a comment if you are liking the story so far~",

      "content": "After what seemed like half an hour or so, the wall which was erected around the three, Saya, Kyouki, and Cordelia, finally broke down as the scenery outside reappeared in their visions.\nKyouki and Cordelia have the same kind of expression. With their eyes at their broadest reach and lips slightly parted, they felt jolts of fret running down their spine as they saw the graveyard in front.\nThe previous floor, which was dyed with the multiple-legged creatures, was now nothing more than a molten mess with the after-effect of flames still evidently burning the remnants of the deceased.\nSaya had a delightful smile as she felt the pride of being her Onii-sama's imouto. She was elated beyond words as her respect for her Onii-sama soared higher than anyone could comprehend.\nShe really adores him and admires what he has become.\n\"You guys alright? That smoke didn't get you, right?\"\nAustin walked back to the group. He took a big container of water before gulping it down in a slight hurry as he heard Kyouki speaking.\n\"You did all the work and asking about our well-being?\"\nKyouki shook his head with a sigh since the fact that he had become just a dead weight was still profoundly stinging his chest. He knows his incapability inside the labyrinth, but still, Kyouki doesn't like to always be on the receiving end.\nAfter Austin had his fill, he offered it to Saya before he looked back at the troubled hero. Austin really can never grow accustomed to this hero's way of thinking.\n\"Listen, Kyouki. I have a hunch that there might come a time in this place where me, Saya, or Cordelia wouldn't be of any use. The situation where the Light of the Hero could only ignite the path of victory. So accumulate all the favors and pay it back at that instance, got it?\"\nKyouki didn't reply; he just took the container from Cordelia and gulped down the rest of the content. As the small conversation concluded, Cordelia walked up to Austin and asked in an uncertain tone.\n\"First time seeing a Spirit user.\"\nAustin glanced at the girl who hadn't been able to come out of her reverie since the battle as he replied with a shrug.\n\"You just didn't look for one, properly.\"\nSeeing Austin's careless attitude toward the matter, Cordelia narrowed her gaze and said something she didn't intend to.\n\"You don't fear that I might report this to the officials? There's a possibility that you might lose your freedom to move willingly any longer.\"\nSaya's cold gaze fell on the bitchy woman who, despite getting her arse saved by her Onii-sama, dared to say such repulsive words.\nAustin held Saya's hand fondly to help her calm down before he turned toward Cordelia.\n\"I think you have misunderstood something on my part, Cordelia-san. I do not belong to Gram, nor do I have much liking for this hippocratic nation. Do you think I would hesitate even a bit to abandon the place you are so devoted to?\"\n**GULP**\nA stiff gulp passed down her throat as she gazed upon the unwavering eyes of the boy who, despite having the appearance, of a teenager, yet carried the ego of a Monarch.\nKyouki held Cordelia's hand and gestured for her to back away. Wordlessly, the girl took a last glance at Austin before retreating to her friend and breathed after a long pause.\n\"Okay then. Let's get going to the next one.\"\nSince Austin sensed that everyone was fine and ready for the next battle, he didn't prolong the advance and pulled out the sledgehammer from his inventory.\nKyouki again felt a strange sensation that seemed to be inviting him toward the massive weapon. This time since he was closer, the temptation seemed denser.\nMoving on his instinct, Kyouki walked to the weapon, which radiated with a golden hue as he extended his hand to touch the handle only to get slapped by Austin just inches apart from it.\nKyouki instantly woke up from reverie as his gaze redirected at the blonde guy, with panic written all over the hero's face.\n\"I-I didn't mean to….\"\n\"It's okay, hero. I understand how you feel.\"\nSaya and Cordelia were also studying Kyouki's movement, which seemed utterly strange before Austin explained the reason why the Hero was reacting in such a way.\nLanding his hand on the weapon, Austin stated after an exasperated sigh.\n\"This and like this, many of my artifacts are made by the dwarves living somewhere in this vast universe. From what I have sensed, the fundamental thing between each of the dwarves' creations, is the presence of the Goddess of Light, Rahia.\"\nThe curiosity grew among the listeners as they heard the unexpected revelation about the weapon Austin uses.\nDwarves were a part of forklore who were famous for heavenly creations and those who were entitled to utilize the blessing of any god they desired.\nSuddenly their perception toward the sledgehammer changed into something more as they heard Austin continuing.\n\"These weapons cannot be used by those who doesn't possess the essence of the Creators of this world. I am just using them through sheer strength and overwhelming will. But that doesn't change the fact that I never deserved such creations.\"\nSilence befell, as Austin concluded his words, astonishing all three in the process. Many things they could never have guessed were disclosed, which made them realize again, how strong Austin is to move such a heavenly creation through his raw capability.\nHearing her brother calling himself unworthy, Saya's heart ached as she pinched his sleeve in protest.\n\"Onii-sama… \"\nGazing at the expression on his silly Imouto, Austin shook his head with a smile as he brought his hand over her head.\n\"Don't make that face. Indeed I am incapable of drawing out the full potential of dwarven things, but that doesn't mean this is the limit of my ability. Other than blessed artifacts and weapons, I do possess something more. Something more potent and matching to your brother's taste.\"\nSaying so, Austin pulled out something from his inventory, which swept the breath away from each three of them in an instant.\n\"O-Onii-sama… this!!\"\n_____________…\nA/N:- There's a reason why Austin is revealing so many things in front of especially Cordelia. Well, you guys will know, so don't worry.\nDrop a comment if you are liking the chapter, and yes, please let me know if you guys have issues regarding the pace of the plot.",

      "content": "The following two floors of the labyrinth went rather quickly compared to the second one. In mere eight hours since they dived in, the group of four was standing on the barren fourth level.\nThanks to the fact that the third and fourth ones contained a single entity as their bosses, which Saya and Kyouki annihilated without much difficulty.\nSaya did her best not to let Austin move and do all the work by herself.\nThe prowess she showed. Her formidable blade skills and precise technique, blended with overwhelming strength, were more than enough to kill the bosses, which were on par with Terror Rank's initial stage.\nKyouki also showcased the skills worth being a hero. From what Austin has seen last time in the war, Kyouki has indeed improved a lot.\nAustin hasn't touched his Legendary Sword even once, but he could sense the dormant energy inside the weapon, which the hero has been slowly accessing through his hard work.\n'Well, this shounen hero would unlock everything with the power of friendship…'\nWith a light chuckle, Austin gripped the handle of his hammer, and just like he had gotten used to, Austin brought the strike down to the ground and broke through.\n**BOOOOM**\nThe sky-shattering collision effect reverberated as the four descended to the next stage. By now, even Cordelia and Kyouki for accustomed to the fall, so they don't use the skills like before.\nAustin threw the hammer back into the inventory while in mid-air since there wasn't any use for it until they didn't clear the fifth level.\nAustin did try on the third floor to break through without defeating the boss, but it failed, and Austin suffered a severe physical backlash.\nThanks to his natural healing capability and the pills Luna had given him, Austin was back to full health in no time.\n\"Argh!\"\n\"Lia!\"\nJust when the four pairs of feet landed on the ground, Cordelia fell on her knees, with her face contouring in pain. Kyouki turned toward his friend in panic before he supported her.\nAustin and Saya looked at the girl in astonishment since nothing seemed to directly or indirectly affect their surroundings.\nThere was no artifact, no mana presence, or anything evident; even the pair searched all around.\n\"I-I am fine… it just feels a little stuffy….\"\nCordelia replied while being supported by the hero as she uttered her words somehow in between her labored breathing.\nHer face was drenched with sweat, and all her facial color was adapting to paleness.\nOther than being in extreme pain, Cordelia seemed fine, with no vital danger whatsoever.\n\"Here, stick this on the middle of your chest.\"\nSuddenly Austin pulled out a sticker that had some scribbling which none of them understood. Cordelia took the long paper instinctively before she looked at Austin for an answer.\n\"This will keep an invisible barrier around you, and resist whatever is affecting.\"\nCordelia thanked Austin before she started unzipping her jacket. Saya instantly covered the stupid woman from her brother.\nKyouki also turned his gaze away and tried to keep his mind occupied with anything but the rustling sound from beside.\nAustin didn't have much care since he never gets bothered by any woman other than one. He took the time to check out the surroundings, which, unlike the previous floors, seemed incredibly silent.\nThe space was equally dark and cold, but something felt odd. Something which made Austin awfully cautious after who knows how long.\n[Already here? Guess, I underestimated you guys.]\nA voice that, by pitch and tone, seemed human yet at the same time contained the density which told otherwise resonated from an unknown source\nAustin focused his senses to find the person, but unfortunately, it came from all around, not from a single direction. Using his fireballs, Austin searched for wider proximity, but the conclusion remained zero.\n[Why are you struggling so much?]\nSuddenly all three became stunned as they saw an unexpected presence standing just inches behind Austin. The latter mentioned didn't turn, but it doesn't mean he was standing there shocked.\n[Hmmm~Aren't you an interesting one?]\nThe entity that erupted out of nowhere smiled in amusement as he saw the stance of the blondie. Even the young man has his front turned on the other side; his arm has been raised with a dagger held in such a position that advancing a step could cause a deep cut.\n\"I share the same sentiment.\"\nIt's been a long time since someone has been able to sneak to Austin's back like this. If not for his natural instincts, which rang like church bells, Austin couldn't have pulled the dagger in time.\n(A/N: -Luna doesn't count since she's pretty above comprehensibility.)\nSaya wanted to step forward as soon as she witnessed the person standing near her Onii-sama, but she knew there might arise repercussions which she would like to avoid.\nTurning steadily with his guard still pulled up, Austin looked at the person who undoubtedly was the floor boss.\nA black robe all over his body with white hair sticking out the cover. Red ruby eyes stared down at Austin with a strange glint of curiosity blended in them.\nApart from his eyes, nothing seemed unnatural with his appearance, which seemed just like an average human's. But that doesn't provide leeway for Austin to turn casual.\nEven though the strange man was standing there lazily, Kyouki realized that there was no possible opening he had left at all. And the fact he was standing so near to Austin, didn't help either.\n\"Compared to the other floor bosses, you seem a little sane.\"\nThe others were just trying to kill Austin, and his group without any reason. Well, it was understandable since it was a labyrinth, but Austin wasn't here for the purpose of clearing this place.\nHe just wanted to get some answers, and this person in front seemed to be the right man.\nHearing the blond boy's words, the robed man smiled in amusement as he spoke in a prideful tone.\n[Of course, I would. After all, what you have faced were all my slaves, and I am their master. The Wizard of the Abyss, Aèzar]\n____________…\nA/N: - Story hasn't turned boring, right?\nI don't know, but keeping Luna out of the story makes me think that maybe viewers don't like it much.\nPlease let me know?",

      "content": "Amidst dark and heavy clouds which could break and drench the surface any moment now, flew a woman who by every angle seemed otherworldly.\nSilver hair tied in a bun with oceanic blue eyes fixated on her front, yet not really caring about where she advanced. Her pale face and the minimal skin she exposed out of her dress, made her look like someone descending from the heavens.\nThe Saintess of Humanity. The Light of Hope and various others, heard and unheard names, have been regarded as this woman.\nBut Austin's favorite, The Dominatrix.\nThat kind of living legend flying over a vast forest couldn't be called a leisure hobby, nor could it be labeled as fighting loneliness.\nWell, Luna indeed was lonely in the absence of her beloved, but it didn't mean she was killing her time by gazing at such a never-ending forest for no definite reason.\nIt's been almost ten hours since Austin left her side and went for the Labyrinth. She tried to engage herself in teaching stuff and other of her research, but nothing proved to be working.\nShe couldn't stop thinking about him at all!\nThanks to the tip she got about the creature who had been building the blessing suppressor artifact, Luna got something to spend her time on.\nAlmost a month ago, Luna spread a kind of spell where small mana balls wander freely anywhere. These aren't just any mana balls but special ones, which Luna creates using her Divine Energy and through her knowledge of Space Magic.\nThe significance of those small pearl-like spheres lies in their vulnerability. Since they aren't visible to anything or anyone, there was a slim chance of those mana balls getting interrupted in between.\nWhat could only erase those mana balls is the same effect that the blessing-suppressing artifact produces.\nAs soon as the connection with one of her Mana orbs disconnected, Luna darted to investigate which bastard had been plotting from the shadows for who knows how long.\n'Was it here…right? '\nBeing a little uncertain, Luna decided to land on the ground first as she enhanced her senses meanwhile\nWith a slow thud, she dropped her feet into the middle of no definite part of the forest which was filled with strange creatures and monsters.\n'[Camouflage]'\nUsing her spell, Luna blended in the greenery as she surveyed her surroundings.\nShe was receiving different mana presence, but none of them were worthy of paying attention. What got her interested was the peculiar sensation she felt upon widening her mana search reach.\nAfter a specific range, the channel became fainter before dropping to zero. That place wasn't so far, so she decided to walk rather than levitate.\nShe didn't even walk ten steps when she suddenly felt someone watching her. It was vague, but Luna wasn't an amateur not to notice such unwanted attention.\nTurning herself to the left, Luna chanted an ice lance on her either hand before she spoke in a profoundly cold tone.\n\"Show yourself, or the next thing you will be peeking at would be hell….\"\nHer voice resonated enough for the person who was hiding on one of the branches of a humongous tree, to hear properly.\nLuna had her aim fixed, and she would have killed the person within blinks; if not, she would have seen a familiar face appearing from the shadows.\n\"You… \"\n______________….\nBack in the labyrinth, there was total silence befell on the fifth stage of the abyss as several figures stood with varying expressions on their faces.\nKyouki had pulled Cordelia behind his back since she wasn't much in shape to engage in battle. Even though he was shielding his friend, Kyouki himself was feeling extremely horrified at the moment to defend anyone.\nEver since this person who called himself The Wizard of Abyss appeared, strange chills spread across the hero with a sensation of being inferior raging high.\nOf course, he wouldn't cower away, but for some reason, Kyouki knew how strong this strange appearance was.\nIt was the same for Saya, albeit a little less influential. She indeed felt the threat from the robbed man, but she wasn't fretting. Maybe she would have measured the man more rationally, if not for the distance he had from her Onii-sama.\nShe couldn't let herself even blink in cautiousness.\nBack on the duo, where every other gaze was focused, Austin stood upright without any sign of wavering emotion on his face.\nWith a thin smile never leaving the older man's face, the Wizard asked in an assertive tone.\n[And what is it you are so eager to know?]\nAustin narrowed his gaze since he never said he came in search of answers. But since he indeed wanted to know a thing or two, he didn't beat around the bush.\n\"The reason why there's no mana can enter this labyrinth.\"\nThis question has been bugging Austin for a while. For some reason, he had a hunch that the mystery behind this unique phenomenon of this Abyss would reveal various of the things Austin desires to unravel.\nHearing Austin's words, the wizard also narrowed his gaze before his smile widened. It seemed he sensed something from Austin, which resulted in such an exaggerated reaction.\n[Hahah… Wonderful! Wonderful indeed!]\nKyouki glanced at Saya as he saw her clutching her katana and ready for combat any second, as the wizard suddenly started to move.\nWhile shaking his head, the wizard facepalmed himself before he leaned slightly forward and whispered something to Austin.\n[You are a System User, aren't you?]\n______________….\nA/N: - I told yah, I have started the preparation for the end. Things would unravel. Various mysteries would be discovered.\nLet's see where this goes.\nStay safe and drop a comment on your way back.\nPeace out ✌️.",

      "content": "Villain's System.\nEver since Austin saw the screen displaying this specific name, he had various queries about it.\nWell, since Austin was himself inside a world he read in a manga, he accepted this system rather quickly.\nBut the curiosity remains in its origination and how it works while keeping a record of different dimensions. An omnipotent system might it be, but still, there were various things that made Austin perplexed.\nLike, how come it gives points, even Austin had done a not-so-villain-worthy task after he met Luna and also, how he was receiving such heavenly items which could break the world balance in an instant.\nBut Austin never paid attention to seeking answers since he already had many things going on in his life.\nAnd now, suddenly today, entirely out of the blue, a strange person who called himself the Wizard, seems to be aware of his system, which naturally shocked Austin beyond belief.\n[Haha… Don't worry, kid. It's not like I have any control over it, nor do I know about it more than its outer covering.]\nAustin narrowed his gaze since the wizard said he didn't have control over his system. That suggests, there was someone who might have.\nHe didn't have a good premonition about this, but at this moment, he couldn't allow himself to panic. His team was dependent on him.\nCollecting his stance, Austin relaxed his shoulders without letting his guard down. Maybe this man knows about the system, and someone might be present who could control it, but that won't hamper Austin very much.\nHe never had let himself get dependent on this sketchy Villain's System since the start.\n[Hmmm? Seems like you are an odd one, too. You don't want to ask about something now, brat?]\nThe expression on Saya was growing darker with each of this bastard's words, who was talking in such a way with her Onii-sama.\nThe Abyssal Wizard completely ignored the raven flashes sizzling around the woman's blade since he found it unworthy to notice. His whole focus was now occupied by this blond kid, who, after this long, had shown something new to his interest.\n\"I know there's nothing you can answer. After all, you are just a dog protecting the real boss beneath our feet, right?\"\nThe smile on the Wizard's face widened strangely as soon he started to laugh in amusement.\n[R-Right. You are damn right about that.]\nKyouki and Cordelia were having a slight tremble of anxiousness with each of the weird man's gestures since he was reeking with an utter ominous sensation.\nBut fortunately, their group Captain was still not showing any sign of stress or hysteria whatsoever. Even though Kyouki had a tendency to be the leader anywhere, he went, but right now, he was thankful he wasn't standing in Austin's place.\n[So, now you are intending to wipe this floor with me and advance to the next one until you don't reach the end, right?]\n\"Well, that's exactly what I have planned.\"\nWithout an ounce of hesitation, Austin affirmed the Wizard's words before the latter pressed his finger on his chin with his gaze upward.\nSuddenly, he snapped his finger with his eyes widened, as it seemed, something popped into his mind.\n[I completely forgot to tell you guys something….]\nThe man levitated in the air before he positioned himself in a position where everyone was able to audience him.\n[All the floors above were protected by my spell, so if you kill me, you guys can have an easy way through to the final boss~]\nAll three except Austin blinked in surprise since it would become extremely simple for them to complete this labyrinth with unknown stages if they just kill this wizard.\nBut Austin knew, every easy leeway requires storms of difficulties.\nAnd as he expected, the Wizard started to show why he was the only sane being present inside the Abyss.\nWith black fog being discharged from his either palm, the smile on the man's face for the first time darkened to a terrifying degree.\n[But the problem is…. You guys are too weak to even leave a scratch on this dog…\n______________…\nA/N: -Let the battle commence.\nI hope you guys are liking the story. Please let me know, in the comments~",

      "content": "Ever since Austin started cultivating his magical prowess and learned martial arts from various teachers, he never met someone who could be regarded as his match.\nStrange it may sound, but until now, only the Terror Rank golem Austin fought on his first expedition has ever given him the chills of threat.\nWell, since Austin was superior to the demon in every way, the slight horror he felt was just the debut anxiety blended with the shock of an unexpected turn of events.\nAnd also, the brawl with Captain Charles was a memorable event, but these two have taken place quite a while ago, so slowly, Austin has forgotten the sensation of his blood boiling with adrenaline.\nThis Wizard, who popped out of nowhere on the fifth floor and had been chattering like he had found something amusing, suddenly initiated the role of being the boss of this floor.\nThe sinister black smog which oozed out of the Wizard's palm covered the whole floor at an alarming rate, but Austin didn't move since he knew this smog wasn't meant to kill him or anyone else.\n'He's just sealing this floor, huh….'\nElemental Types mage is what Austin was primarily evaluated on. He could discern the change in something's state in real-time.\nIf the floor beneath his feet was raw rocks and marbles until now, then that ominous add-on from the Wizard has made it impossible for Austin to evaluate where his foot has been standing.\nAs from what the Abyssal Wizard said, it was natural for him to seal the ground so Austin doesn't take a shortcut to the next stage.\n\"K-Kyo-chan…\"\nKyouki's eyes turned from the Wizard to his friend before his gaze widened in shock just upon catching the glimpse upon witnessing Cordelia's state.\nHer body was partially covered with a raven hue, with her eyes losing focus on the man she could only seek for help. She was feeling her world drowning in darkness.\n[Poor child. Possessing Dark Runes in front of its Creator, would surely bring you to such a state. Well, if you don't want her to suffer blondie, then you better release her seal and let her dwell in my darkness.]\nUndoubtedly Cordelia was a user of Ancient technique which was unknown to Austin. If the Wizard has the same attribute with such monstrous efficiency, it made sense why Cordelia had been suffering since she landed on this floor.\nIf not for the [Affect Suppressor] seal Austin has given to Cordelia, she might have become one of the Wizard's slaves until now.\n\"W-What should we do, Austin?\"\nThe hero was panicking like never before since it was the first time seeing someone precious to him on the verge of death. If not for Austin being present around, Kyouki might have lost it.\nGritting his teeth in frustration, Austin commanded the hero with his eyes, never leaving the Wizard.\n\"[Call Of Purgatory]. Use that on her until I don't defeat this bat shit.\"\nKyouki's eyes widened in astonishment since the skill Austin spoke was something he had never shown to anyone. But it wasn't time to think of something useless.\n\"You know I won't be any help if I start exorcising her, right?\"\nKyouki had no plan to back out when Austin gave him such a tremendous idea of something he himself possessed, but there was a limitation on what the current self of Hero could do.\nWhile using the Purgatory, Kyouki could only focus on his subject and not even on himself. It was a high-ranking Light Magic, after all!\n\"Well, in front of that monster, you will be nothing more than a dead weight.\"\nKyouki sneered before he picked Cordelia in a bridal carry and went to a corner of the floor, leaving the brother-sister duo alone to face this unknown strange entity.\n\"Onii-sama?\"\nSaya tilted her head in confusion as she saw her brother extending two small daggers in her direction. Perplexed, she took the daggers before she realized their significance.\n\"T-this… ?\"\nSaya shuddered slightly upon receiving the plain-looking dagger with such enchantment which made her tremble in a fret and wonder who could have even mustered such Holy Energy to build the weapon.\n\"It's a gift from Luna. She asked me to give it to you when the time is right. Sigh* how does she know everything ....\"\nSaya could feel the helplessness and awe in her brother's voice for Luna, but currently, even Saya couldn't help herself from feeling impressed. Indeed Saya wasn't even near the level where Luna had been dominating for who knows how long\n.\nClutching the hilt of the dagger in a rigid hold, Saya spoke in a determined tone.\n\"I won't let you down, Onii-sama.\"\nAustin nodded with a slight smile before he refocused on the wizard, who hadn't moved from his spot at all.\n[How heartwarming~ I will make sure to keep you guys close in my shadow army~]\nAustin didn't answer since his attention was already drawn upon the unexpected appearance of those who the Wizard regarded as his Shadow Army.\nSeveral figures of those creatures which Austin already had fought and some of those he had never thought of standing against so soon, erupted out of the ground.\nYes, this was what made him excited. This was what Austin needed to push himself to the limit. This sensation is what he could never get tired of.\n[Brace yourself. You are now under my domain. The one who rules on shadow, the Wizard of the Abyss. Let's see what you have to offer in return, blondie~]\n________________….\nA/N: - Let the chaos commence~",

      "content": "Dark magic isn't something taught in general since there isn't any method to know its route. Even its existence doesn't have any evident clue but just gossiped about through generations.\nPeople write villain's in children's books as the user of Dark Magic but other than that, no one seemingly talks about this specific field of wizardry.\nIt was said that thousands of years ago, people used to possess such arts along with Spiritual tongues and other ancient techniques.\nNecromancy is one of the branches which originates from Dark Magic and as its name suggests, necromancy allows the user to rule over the dead.\nAustin was fascinated to know that something like slaving the deceased could be possible. But unfortunately, he didn't have time to marvel at the skill in leisure since it was that skill currently trying to kill him.\n**SLASHH**\n\"You fine there, Saya?\"\nAs Austin slashed the Giant Shadow Ape he asked his sister who was fighting these slaves at a different end.\nIt's been an hour or so since the battle of thousands against two commenced. The Abyssal Wizard was enjoying the show while levitating and the other two, silently took refuge in a corner.\nThe shadow slaves surprisingly didn't seem how one could expect them to be. Unlike real shadows, they weren't dark and seemed lifeless. Rather, it seemed they were just incarnations of their true self.\nThe initial monsters were easy to defeat or to say, Austin just needed his bare punches and kicks to wipe out more than a hundred shadow monsters.\nBut soon the difficulty started to increase with the strength of the newly added monsters, like Tyrant Ox and Ullr Stags, being on completely different levels. Austin had to keep up with the lot since he didn't want anything to pass his radar and attack Kyouki and Cordelia.\nNot only were the new monsters stronger and faster but also contained some Unique skills or offensive attacks like the Serpent Queen used against the Hero.\nAustin had the means to obliterate them in an instant through the help of Spirits but he knew it would be futile. He has understood that the Wizard is just testing him for some reason.\nEven after summoning so many shadow warriors, the Wizard seemed to be relaxed and completely fine. His gaze was only drawn to Austin with a grin never leaving his face.\n'Welp, I just have to gauge his heart out… '\nThrowing useless banter for a later time, Austin swung his spear and decapitated a Silver Fang Wolf. The wolf, despite being about 10 meters in size, was cleanly chopped with the mysterious spear Austin carries.\nRanged arsenal suits his taste and so Austin chose the spear as his main weapon. The current one he carries had specifications like:\n[Type: - Weapon]\n[Grade: - S]\n[Name: - Dark Star]\n[Enhancement: - Dripping Blood Effect ]\n[Description: - The fallen star of Raven Eye bestowed with the concentration of its soul which further poured down in a furnace to build this remarkable weapon. The blacksmith not only has applied what they found as raw but their experience along with blood-sweat also could be seen through its usage.]\nIt has the effect of drawing out the blood of the enemy it impales until the victim doesn't die of blood loss. But in front of these soulless beings, this effect was nothing but just a decoration.\nBut since Austin had only this spear to fight against such hard-skinned monsters, he wasn't going to complain and continued his onslaught.\nSaya was also doing her side quite fluently without any scratches inflicted until now. She has trained herself for this moment. To be useful to her brother and make his burden as less as she could.\n**SHLIING**\nThe thunder roared with the shrill reverberation of her katana as Saya sliced a Whiptail Iguana into pieces with ferocity and accurate precision.\nHer blade skills were far better than any of the warriors existing in today's era and along with the humongous mana she carries, Saya could be counted as an army herself.\nDespite being restricted on spells, Saya was able to utilize the minuscules of her mana through the skill of her blade.\nHer kill rate was undoubtedly high but compared to her brother, she still was falling a lot short.\n'No, I have to do better…'\nSolely with the wish to reduce some burden from her brother, Saya ascended in the air as she gathered some higher degree of mana in her blade and covered herself in raven lightning in the process.\nWith her eyes clouding behind the bolts, Saya charged at the incoming horde of monsters.\n[Fall of Judgment!]\n**CREAK**\nThe eyes of the wizard slightly widened since with that attack, not only tens of monsters ceased to exist in an instant but also, the floor was impacted with a deep crack.\nThe Wizard wasn't threatened to get his seal broken, rather he felt surprised to see the prowess of the girl. Now she also piqued his interest but not as much as the blondie.\nSaya was physically fine despite using such a ferocious attack but what troubled her was the backlash she felt because of using mana. Feeling slightly dizzy, Saya supported herself with her blade when she heard a very familiar voice.\n\"Didn't I say, not to use Mana? When did you become so disobedient?\"\nWhile panting Saya wanted to apologize but suddenly her brother pushed a pill into her mouth.\n\"!!\"\nAbruptly the burning sensation inside her vanished in an instant and the backlash she felt also disappeared.\nRegaining her composure, Saya bowed deeply as she uttered her words of apology in the shame of what she partook in.\n\"I am deeply ashamed of myself, Onii-sama. I made you worry about me even though we are middle of this… \"\nSince Saya wiped all the nearby monsters, they had at least a minute window before another wave approaches.\nAustin took his time to console his sister as he also felt regretful for scolding her. Bringing his hand over her head, he spoke in a warming tone.\n\"It's okay, you don't have to feel so dejected about it. I just don't want you to hurt in any way, so please take care of yourself a little more and don't let your emotions control your actions, okay?\"\nSaya slowly raised her head upon hearing her brother's words as she stared at his radiating gaze with utter fondness.\n\"Onii-sama… \"\nThe atmosphere between the two was so gentle and familial that it could have even melted a rock. Even though Saya had romantic feelings toward her brother, her sisterly traits always dominated when her Onii-sama says such unfair things.\nThe feeling of having a family who has always cared for you without asking anything in return always leaves Austin in amazement and amplifies his love for his sister.\n**ROARR**\nSuddenly in between the pleasant silence, one of the Crimson Chimera roared as the stampede neared furiously.\nBoth Saya and Austin's expressions contoured in annoyance at being interrupted.\n\"This is getting on my nerves… \"\nSaying in a little agitation, Austin pulled out a peculiar sword from his inventory since he has decided to end this right here and right now.\nSaya's eyes widened in shock as she gasped to breathe upon witnessing the blade her brother had chosen. And the same reaction was spread over the Wizard's face since he never imagined the blondie having such a thing in the store.\n['It seems I underestimated you… ']\n__________________…\nA/N: - I'll describe how the usage of mana affects the user in the near future.

      "content": "Curse energy is the nemesis of Mana.\nFrom where these two energies originate and what are their sources, no one has ever come to conclude. It's just been flowing around the globe since this world came into existence.\nIt was a commonly known knowledge that those who possess mana couldn't get involved with cursed energy since these two are the same poles of two different magnets.\nAfter the first expedition, Austin was alleged to be a user of Cursed Energy which the Pope denied as a baseless presumption.\nAt that time, Austin indeed didn't possess anything which runs on the cursed power but now, things were different.\n\"O-Onii-sama, this…\"\nSaya stuttered in slight nervousness as she saw the long curved blade Austin pulled from the inventory.\nThe blade was almost two meters tall including its handle. The blunt side of the blade was carved like waves with the blade having a width of half a meter.\nBut rather than its design or the blade's size, what choked Saya's breath was the energy being released by the weapon. The condensed cursed energy was more than enough to put a low-rank warrior into a slumber.\nAustin sensed the discomfort and concern from his sister before he let go of her hand and walked to his front.\nThe hundreds of monsters were ferociously approaching the duo with no stopping them in their stampede. There were almost every type of creature which they fought on this floor.\nAustin inhaled deeply while holding the demonic sword in his left hand. It was the special prize that he had earned not long ago, through the completion of a quest.\nAt first, he was shocked but Luna convinced him that there was nothing evil or good in the path of strength. Whatever makes Austin stronger is acceptable until it doesn't hurt him.\nThose were a Sanitess' words.\nAustin raised the sword, pulling it toward his right shoulder he gathered some mana in his feet to maintain balance before slashing the blade in the open air.\n**WOOOOOONG**\nLike an intense churchbell rang from extremely close proximity, the purple wave of raw cursed energy slashed through the air and widened as it advanced.\nThe Abyssal Wizard raised his brows in amazement upon witnessing the perfect balance of curse and mana portrayed by the blondie.\nIt wasn't just a rare sight, but rather an anomaly. A mysterious boy who has piqued his interest to this extent, in so many centuries.\n'I bet she would love to meet him…'\nA [SS] rank demonic sword, when swung by such ferocity using the primitive skill of [Extermination], one could imagine how it would affect the victims.\nWithin tens of seconds, almost five hundred shadow monsters were slashed in two pieces with corps falling at an alarming rate.\nAustin might have the strength to wield Cursed-originated weapons but it didn't mean it doesn't affect him. After the catastrophic attack, Austin threw the bloodthirsty sword back into inventory.\nKyouki and Cordelia were equally shocked to witness such prowess that took out a whole horde in one go. It was not just the raw strength and capability of holding a cursed sword. Austin also displayed how much he cares about his teammate by not letting even one monster pass a certain range.\nWhile still exorcising his friend to keep her safe, Kyouki spoke in a soft tone.\n\"And you asked why I wasn't placed in the role of leader.\"\nCordelia sensed the helplessness and admiration in Kyouki's voice toward Austin. She wanted to console him but doing so would only have made the matter worse.\nGliding her hand on top of his, Cordelia rather chose to be optimistic.\n\"But there's always someone stronger than the strongest. I bet Kyo-chan can be that person one day.\"\nKyouki smiled thinly upon hearing her encouraging words which usually Sicily and Lilia use to keep his spirit burning.\nAmidst the silence, Kyouki suddenly frowned upon a realization as he spoke in a heavier tone.\n\"Hey, Lia. What you saw right now, please don't add this in your report.\"\nCordelia wasn't surprised to hear the request since she already had guessed long ago. But rather than being reluctant, she smiled in understanding and spoke something unexpected.\n\"I know how important Austin is for Gram and humankind. Reporting this to those old geezers would only push him away so I will be a little dishonest in my statements.\"\n_.\nBack in the center of the floor, the Wizard was smiling ear to ear as he approached Austin who still was cautious as ever with his sister standing beside him.\nSaya had her hand on her katana's hilt as she awaited the opening she craves. But unfortunately, the Wizard despite looking carefree, had left no loop in his stance.\n[Amusing you two. I had fun like this after who knows how fu*king long. Woof! I also had some goosebumps upon seeing that demon's tooth in your hand.]\nThe Wizard exaggeratedly spoke in a high pitch while exposing his pale hands to show how impressed he was.\nNot receiving any reply from the duo, the Wizard soon becomes bored as he started explaining something out of nowhere.\n[You know, what you guys fought was just the essence of their soul. If you two have gone against the real thing, I can't even imagine what chaos would have befallen my floor. Lucky me~]\nAustin had a bad premonition about where this was going but until he doesn't clear this Wizard's annoying tests, Austin knew, he would end up gaining nothing.\nThere was no option rather than to wait and see what this robed bastard has in store.\nAfter levitating around the brother-sister duo, the Abyssal Wizard landed in front of them before he summoned a big cube in his hand.\nLooking at the pair with an egoistic glance, the Wizard spoke in a haughty tone.\n[What you two fought were just broken toys of mine. I will recognize your worth only if you defeat this thing on your own, Austin Vincent Wright! ]\nSaying so, the Wizard dropped the cube on the ground before a very familiar thing appeared in front.\nUpon witnessing the appearance, Austin sighed as he muttered under his breath.\n'All that hype for this thing…'\n_____________________\nA/N: - Readers have reduced somehow.

      "content": "During the great war which occurred between Hero and the Great Demon Lord in the manga, there came a time when the hero's party was against something they never expected.\nAmongst the seven generals of the Monarch of Darkness, the sixth one who was proficient in Dark Manipulation and Mind Interference magic was the one who brought this catastrophe against Hero Kyouki.\nIt was a Mechanical Golem that had every kind of Element resistance and had physical prowess which could even outmatch the Hero of Light in his prime!\nIt was a brutal contest between the two which lasted for a whole volume(2 weeks) and only after the help of Lilia's inherited spell, the golem was put under a barrier yet not defeated.\nThe Hero's party was badly injured against such a danger which far surpassed the Demon General possessing it. But after their proper coordination and teamwork, it ended well.\nStrangely, the same thing which Austin has seen through 2d drawings was recently summoned by the Abyssal Wizard.\nThe fact of the matter which made Austin perplexed was, how come this golem was here? Maybe, the creator of this war machine is also a demon? Or maybe, the demons steal it from this Abyssal Wizard?\nSince curse energy works fine inside the Labyrinth, the second option seemed plausible. Well, Austin didn't have much leeway to think leisurely.\nAfter all, Austin's subject of interest was currently raining an onslaught on him.\n*DHAK*\nWith both hands joined, the 60 ft tall Golem with four limbs like a human and a square middle body, stomped its fist where Austin was a moment ago.\nIts face just like its body, was also symmetrical with a pair of hollow eyes.\nAustin felt like laughing when they saw such a cartoon as Golem in reality but again, he doesn't have the time to stop at the moment.\nIt seemed the mangaka didn't take time to draw this which resulted in this reality that Austin has to face.\nSaya was commanded by her brother to stay on Cordelia and Kyouki's side since the Golem was huge enough to damage them through just shockwaves.\nShe was biting her lips in annoyance while shielding the two. In the end, her Onii-sama had to do all the things by himself.\nBut little did she know, Austin was just playing around with the thing while patiently waiting for the time when he could hit the big doll.\nAustin was aware of the Golem's weak point which was in between its hollow eyes. One of the benefits of being a transmigrated.\n**SWIING**\nSuddenly two huge blades were released by its huge smiling mouth in Austin's direction. It was rotating at high speed as it advanced toward its prey.\nThey clearly weren't just two rotating blades but also had some kind of sorcery involved since, even though Austin dodged and dashed in a different direction, the pieces of metal didn't lose their sight and followed their target.\nUsing the inhumane raw strength in his legs, Austin was shifting from one place to another in no time but still, it wasn't enough.\n'It's annoying… '\nAustin got enough intel on the Golem and now he was done running around.\nLanding his feet abruptly, Austin turned toward the incoming blades before he applied some minuscules of mana on his senses.\nSoon the rotation speed slowed down for him and also the shape of it became vivid.\nIt was a slim double leaf-shaped blade with a circular gap at the center, probably given as a handle.\nSaya's eyes widened in a fret and Wizard's in amusement when the blades reached only some inches apart from the blond youth.\n\"ONII-SAMA!!\"\nSaya was about to jump toward the spot despite not being sure whether she could make it or not, but soon she halted upon witnessing the scene.\nThe Wizard also raised his brows in admiration as he saw how perceptive and observant this teenage boy is.\nThe reason for such a reaction was, how easily Austin dodged the blades by just tapping some certain points.\nA little push at the perfect time and their trajectory were changed. The blades passed by Austin and soon collided with each other and canceled out the rotation altogether.\nThe whole ordeal happened in fractions of a second. No one was able to discern when Austin moved and dodged the blades with such fluency. It indeed was a surprising event.\nAustin wasn't much invested in what he did as he had to take out a piece of blabbering-robed bastard first.\n\"XXX-XXXXXX-XXXX-XXXXX\"\nThe Wizard's eyes couldn't be stretched more in amazement, as he heard very familiar syllables being spoken by Austin. The sorcery which reins above all. The Spiritual Magic.\nAustin on the other hand, had no mind to pay attention to anyone at the moment since he was gathering a whole lot of red fiery spirits around him.\nThe amount was quite a lot which required just his focus not much time.\nAfter just ten seconds, Austin had what he wanted as he channeled the energy through his pores and commanded all the spirits roaming around the floor.\n\"XXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX!\"\nThe command was simple yet destructive. But the spirits loved entertainment and looking at the funny big creature, they knew it would be going to be fun.\nThe Golem sensed something approaching but since it wasn't just from one direction, the Killing Machine, failed to counter.\n**SWOOOOSH**\nLike a domain of fire suddenly raining down the sky, the Golem got covered in flames which wasn't just restricting its body and blocking its vision from its prey, but also minimizing its movement.\nThe fire curtains were wide enough to cover the area where the Golem could flail.\nThe Golem finally analyzed the situation and commenced its arms movement clockwise to extinguish the fire at least from its body.\nThe inhuman thing had its senses again freed as it surveyed its whole body to find the human it was preying for.\nBut Austin wasn't an amateur to just show up like a guest visiting neighborhood.\nWith his body covered with nothing but burning flames, Austin appeared in mid-air with his demonic blade raised in arc and inches apart from the forehead of the Golem.\n[Hahah! How many surprises do you have in store boy? Amusing! Amusing indeed! However… ]\n**CLING**\nAustin's eyes widened as his blade didn't connect at the spot he wanted rather a small protective seal was broken with his strike.\n**UOOOOOH**\nThe Golem instantly identified the human before it extend its arm and got a hold of its prey.\nThe spirits were also called off since the connection was lost and the whole scene returned to normal except for the fact that Austin wasn't liberated any longer.\n[...you can't just predict everything on just a whim~]\n______________\nA/N: - Drop a comment~",

      "content": "From what Austin read in his previous life, the Golem which the Hero party fought had its weak point situated at the middle of its eyes.\nThe Golem was highly precautious about its vulnerability which was why Kyouki wasn't able to finish it off despite knowing the Killing Machine's weak spot. And Kyouki only discovered this fact from his anonymous strikes all over its gigantic body.\nIn the end, with Lilia's inherited spell [Seal of Elhiem], the Golem was put into a slumber of eternity where only Lilia could bring it back to life.\nBut in the manga, no seal was found when the Hero party fought the Golem which further implies that there might not be only one of these Chaotic Machines available.\nThinking of tens of these things roaming freely on the above land would undoubtedly bring chaos. But at the moment Austin didn't have much time to mind about such things.\n\"Ughh… \"\nWith a slight groan, Austin tried to break free from the cage he was caught in. But due to the restriction to his limbs, he was failing miserably.\nSaya was extremely frustrated at this point since she didn't have the courage to break her brother's order and seeing him in pain was making her heart clench.\nShe was completely stuck!\nFortunately, Austin didn't make his sister suffer anymore.\n\"[Gravity Manipulation]\"\nChanneling heavy mana through his pores, Austin applied gravity in reversal to push the Golem's hand apart.\nThe backlash was severe enough to bring a mouthful of blood in his mouth, but Austin didn't pay much mind to it and taking the slight agape in its grip, he instantly leaped out.\nThe Golem didn't take time to respond as it lifted its arm and brought it down to the place where Austin landed.\nBut it was a mistake to judge that the human would be vulnerable after the ordeal.\n**SLING**\nLike a horrifying shadow, Austin disappeared from his spot before the hand which was about to land was sliced apart from its arm.\nThe Golem lifted its severed arm in perplexion before it felt something massive approaching from its back.\n**DHAKK**\nInstinctively raising its hand above its head, the Golem saw being struck with a purple blade which was being held by the same human who seemed weakened a moment ago.\nAustin didn't prolong his attack before using all the stat of his agility to move away from his spot. His eyes were slightly red without any particular emotions left in them.\nThe demonic sword he held suited the current self of the blond youth who had a terrifying aura presently surrounding him.\nThe Golem was unable to track Austin's speed before the latter appeared near the machine's leg and slashed his blade using strength rather than precision.\n**SLING**\nThe slinging sound again resonated as the cursed sword made a deep cut in the Golem's left leg but to no avail. The Golem had high adaptability which caused the curse energy to affect it less with each strike.\nThe Golem just lifted its left leg with extreme force while lifting the human who was standing near along with it. But Austin didn't plan to be kicked so easily.\nUsing his skill [Indefinite Leap] Austin made some distance from the giant as he stabilized his mind for a moment.\nHis physical might may be tremendous but the Golem was even stronger than Austin when it comes to physical prowess. Using mana was also influencing Austin severely to the point where he felt slightly dizzy.\nHis only option was Spiritual Magic but other than Elements, he couldn't ask for Time and Space spirits since they are egotistical beings.\n'Well, screw it! '\nAustin bit his lips before conjuring three boulders over the approaching Golem. The rocks were heavy enough to destroy the fort of Eden Academy.\nJust as the gigantic machine reached some meters apart from him, Austin brought the boulders down in an instant and stomped the Golem underneath the rocks.\n**UGOOOOOH**\nThe Golem cried in agony as the boulders were heavy enough to make it fall to the ground. The rumbling of the floor was caused by the crash along with the heavy roar.\n\"XXXXX–XXXXX-XX\"\nAustin gathered the fire spirits again around himself before he levitate in mid-air. It wouldn't have taken much time for the Golem to break free, so Austin hurried and formed three votives surrounding the captive.\n\"XX-XXX\"\nA single command and the portals started pouring blaze on the Golem like hell has been bestowed upon upper lands. Any top-ranking warrior would have burnt to cinder under such a raging blaze that Austin brought down at one place.\nThe scene from afar was magnificent at the same time terrifying enough to make Cordelia and Kyouki gulp in a fret as they gazed upon the battleground.\nThe fire vortices lasted for half a minute before they disappeared as per Austin's command.\nAfter the smoke subdued what came into vision was molten rocks sticking to the Golem like amber slimes. Austin expected such results as he soon called for Wind Spirits.\n\"XXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXX\"\nThe long command just focused om bringing storms over the temporarily paralyzed Golem. The gust was solely focused on n siding the molten rocks and so it went as expected.\n**SWOOOOOOSH**\nThe storms of wind were heavy enough to make the surrounding people waver from their spot while the Golem tried to break free. However, the tribulation occurred fast enough for the Golem to even counter adequately.\nThe Wizard was enjoying the display of such continuous use of Spiritual energy and how Austin was guiding the spirits in the best way possible for his advantage.\nAustin didn't give another glance at what he did as he brought the same hammer out of his inventory which he used to breakthrough the floors.\nThe Golem was caged but not for long. Austin's energy was depleting at a warning rate. The next strike would decide whether he could handle such catastrophic creation in his current strength or not.\n'Never thought I would reach my limit so soon… '\n__________________…\nA/N: - Sorry if it seemed rushed since I wanted to cover this golem part rather quickly.\nDrop a comment~",

      "content": "\"Never thought I would meet you here…and alone.\"\nUnder the brightly shining sun, two women of similar ages walked through a dense forest that was only surrounded by greenery and wild creatures.\nThe girl who just spoke in an uncertain tone was a short crimson hair cool beauty who previously was also a student of Eden Academy, Vanessa Charles.\nUnlike in the past, she had much more warrior sharpness in her frame, and her aura also seemed to be profoundly heavier than before.\nLuna was surprised to see such a change in Venessa if taking the time she left the Academy into consideration. Not normally people grow this much in so less time.\n\"Alone huh? Were you expecting someone with me or something?\"\nVanessa's steps halted abruptly as she heard Luna's teasing remark which for some reason seemed threatening as well. Vanessa chose to stay silent on the matter for her own good.\n\"Forget it. If you don't want to become a hindrance, stop following me.\"\nLuna would have used levitation and gotten rid of this baggage that popped out of nowhere but to find the artifact creator, she has to tread carefully.\n\"Believe it or not, I am not the same person who bitched around the whole day. If anytime I seem to become a problem in your way, I will do my best to remove myself away.\"\nLuna didn't respond but she know, the current Venessa was indeed a different person who unlike in the past seemed more reliable and mature.\n\"!!\"\nAll of sudden, Luna's feet halted with her eyes stretching wide and the color from her face evaporating in an instant.\nVanessa got startled to see such a reaction from the Saintess as she hurriedly approached Luna and asked in a slow whisper.\n\"Did something happen?\"\nWith her eyes still, unmoving Luna parted her lips and was able to usher a single word out of her throat.\n\"....Austin.\"\n__________________\n\"Onii-sama! Are you okay?! Where does it hurt?\"\nAs Saya charged at the scene she helped her fallen brother to sit while leaning his back on her bent leg and her free hand searching for any injury.\nThe Golem which has been creating havoc until now has been destroyed to pieces through the usage of Dwarves' Hammer.\nBut after the strike, Austin also fell to the ground with a profound frown contouring his face and discomfort seemingly rushing all over his body.\n\"I-I am okay… Just the usage of mana-Khwak…\nAustin vomited a mouthful of blood on the ground, increasing Saya's anxiety as tears also started bubbling in her round eyes.\nIt was the result of the severe backlash Austin felt from using such a weapon which required his mana and added to the previous usage too. He was fortunate to have such a strong will that didn't let his consciousness fade away.\n[Aww… and here I was stretching myself to go on a round or two against you. Sad you are dying..]\nThe Abyssal Wizard's voice reached up to the two before Saya growled with her eyes growing fiery toward the robed-talking piece of shit.\nHer body was flickering with raven lightning as her breathing grew erratic past each second with her gaze turning life-threatening.\nAnyone would have lost their confidence in front of the current Saya and it was no different for the Wizard as well. The smirk on his face vanished as he stared back at the woman who gave a presence seemingly bigger than he primarily evaluated.\nThe Wizard had a hunch that if not for mana restriction, the battle between him and the woman might not have concluded in his favor.\n\"It's okay, Saya. I'll be fine in a minute. \"\nAustin held his sister's hand before she does something irreversible as he took out a dagger from his inventory.\nSaya turned her gaze toward her brother as she saw a cyan radiance glowing from the small weapon.\n\"Onii-sama, this… \"\n\"Yeah. It's coated with Holy Magic which Luna gave me in case of emergency. I never thought I would be using it just on the fifth floor tho… \"\nSaying so, Austin pierced the dagger right into his left chest pad. The dagger was far better than any of Austin's recovery pills or recovery artifacts. But since it takes a toll on the user's body, Luna only created one.\n\"Argh! \"\nAustin's hold on Saya's hand subconsciously tightened to the point she felt her bones creaking but she didn't had mind to pay attention to it as she kept her worried gaze fixated on her brother.\nAustin was in severe pain since the remedy was working efficiently at each corner of his body and recovering the mana that Austin lost during the fight. Since there was no mana in the surrounding, once lost mana would never be returned until they are in the labyrinth.\nAnd Austin had lost a lot in his last onslaught.\nWhile getting treated, Austin whispered in a low tone that only Saya could hear.\n\"Listen carefully, Saya. I will now engage in battle with that Wizard. I will occupy him in every way possible but as I have sensed, I cannot kill him. That's why I need your help.\"\nSaya nodded in determination as she never was planning to let her brother get in this alone again. This time she would do whatever she can to end this robbed bastard once and for all.\n\"Alright, Onii-sama. You create the opening and I will use everything I have to land the final blow. \"\n__________________….\nA/N: - This Labyrinth would be wrapped up in a couple of chapters.

      "content": "Due to the last brawl with the Golem, Austin's armor was mostly broken and some cuts on his inner vest were also inflicted.\nThere was not much time to change into new armor and guards and the current one was nothing but seemed like a hindrance.\nSo after letting go of his guard, Austin just stood in his torn shirt with his lower wear fortunately still unscathed.\nHis breathing calmed down somewhat as he stared at the Abyssal mage who was still levitating albeit a little higher than before.\nSaya took some distance from her brother since she was told to take the final strike. Until then, she could just pray that her Onii-sama doesn't hurt himself.\nKyouki and Cordelia were in their previous position with their eyes glued to the battlefield as sweat profoundly covered their foreheads.\nIt was mind-numbing to see Austin fighting the Golem one-on-one and came out victorious. Taking mana restriction and the prowess the Golem carried into consideration, both of them had no hope of even withstanding that machine for some minutes.\nIt wasn't that they were under-evaluating themselves. It's just that a single boy of the same age as them has strength that they have long lost the capability to comprehend.\nAustin inhaled deeply, before he exchanged his demonic sword with a strange spear.\nUntil he doesn't evaluate what this Wizard actually is, Austin prefers to maintain a certain distance.\nThe spear he ejected out of the inventory was a golden-staffed weapon with a 10 cm spear blade and a dark orb connected to its rear end. It was 2.4 m in length and relatively lengthier than most of his weapons.\nPointing the tip in the Wizard's direction, Austin closed his eyes for a second before he gathered strength in his legs and lunged forward, leaving a smoke of gust behind.\n\"Hupp!\"\nThe leap was huge, to say the least as within five seconds he was at a reachable distance from the Wizard before Austin swung his spear in an upward slash with ferocious speed.\n*TING**\nBut to no avail. The Wizard just flickered the approaching attack with his fingers without much change of expression. It totally was a waste to attack him front-on.\nBeing thrown off-balance, Austin tried to retreat but it was too late.\n**DHAK**\nA fist revealed out of the long robe Wizard shrouds himself with and stuck near Austin's ribs.\n**BOOOOOM*\nAustin was thrown to the ground with a single punch as the crash formed cracks in the floor.\nThe exchange happened in so little time that the three watching from a distance had their eyes wide at their farthest reach and mouth parted in shock.\nThey have grown somehow accustomed to seeing Austin dominating the battle so this conclusion was somewhat startling.\nBut Austin was far from shocked. He darted from his place and this time he didn't leap but ran to the Wizard and threw his spear with sheer force.\n**SLING**\nWithout letting a second go waste, Austin ran to the back side of Wizard and jumped furiously with his eyes turning slightly red.\nThe spear and his leap were in alignment as they approached the Wizard from two different directions.\nIt was a splendid display of precise spear technique and tremendous agility to match himself just accurately with the weapon.\nBut again, it was futile…\n**TING**\nWith a bell ringing sound, the Wizard grabbed both the spearhead and Austin's incoming punch with his body turned sideways without much effort at all.\nAustin was in the Wizard's hold, but rather than shocked, a grin spread across his face which made the man frown slightly.\nBut before he could have expected what was to come, Austin swung something in a frightening manner and got himself out of the hold.\nThe wizard raised his brows before he lifted his hand and saw there was nothing after his forearm.\nLanding on the ground, Austin threw the slain hand away as he figured something useful out.\nThere wasn't any blood or muscle visibly flowing out of the cut but just a black smoke emerged before the Wizard's hand was back to normal.\n'He's weak in close range… '\nAustin concluded that the man's reflexes were a little dull when he slashed his dagger and thus formed the next thing which the blond youth is going to advance upon.\nBut the problem was Wizard's position. While being in the air, Austin couldn't engage in close combat for long. That brings the requirement of the only way possible.\n'Let's take you down first… '\n________________…\nA/N: - Action scenes are tiring.

      "content": "*Hah*Hah*\nPanting in slight exhaustion Austin stood with his hand resting on his bent knees as he stared at the Abyssal Wizard who still was in his previous position, completely unfazed.\nAustin tried his Spiritual Magic on the Wizard. Flames, Earth, Aqua. But the man either dodged or blocked the attacks somehow.\nAustin did have an artifact, especially for binding purposes but it requires a heavy amount of mana, thus no good. If he really has to use mana then he would use it on something less taxing.\n[Gravity Manipulation]\nExtending his hand, Austin applied a pulling force to the Wizard's feet, and surprisingly it wasn't much troubling to do so. The robed Wizard was brought down quite naturally but it wasn't like Austin felt nothing out of it.\nThe small amount of magical energy released was enough to make him feel slightly dizzy but not to the point where Austin would miss such a good opportunity to hunt his prey.\n[Hahaha… Even this skill? How many tricks do you actually possess kid~]\nIt was evident that the Wizard wasn't struggling at all being pulled down to the floor as he laughed in amusement at the new interesting discovery he had about the blondie.\nTaking out his twin short dagger which was a [A] rank reward he got from the system a long time ago, Austin rushed toward the wizard without any further ado.\nSaya was primarily quite troubled seeing her brother again using mana but there wasn't anything she could do other than wait. She knew jumping in the fight now would be nothing more than becoming a hindrance.\n'Please don't hurt yourself Onii-sama… '\nThe first thing Austin did was to maximize his speed as much as he can despite knowing that the Wizard has his gaze fixed on his every movement.\nFrom a natural perspective, Austin was going for a frontal assault but that was just to look predictable.\nSince in reality…\n[Hmmm?]\nThe Wizard raised his hand to halt Austin's attack which was a pathetic frontal slash with his back-gripped dagger. But the Wizard wasn't able to grab hold of the blondie for some reason. It somehow seemed like he was seeing an after image…?\n'[Don't tell..] '\nBefore the Wizard would have realized what trickery he had fallen into, a massive impact was inflicted on the left side of his torso.\n[Urgh… Wha..?!]\nThere stood Austin with an expressionless complexion adorning his face as he didn't use his still-held daggers rather he chose to punch this damn Wizard for once.\n[How you… ]\nIt was the first time when the expression on the Wizard's face contoured this dangerously since he never expected the blondie to play such a card all of a sudden.\nAustin didn't have any intention to quell the old man's curiosity as he slashed his left hand and intended to rip the man's throat with his dagger.\nBut the Wizard wasn't a newbie who would fall for everything. He gripped Austin's approaching wrist in a rigid hold before a grin spread on his pale lips.\n[Not so smart kid… ]\nBut it was a misconception of the Wizard that he got a hold of Austin.\n[Huh!]\nBefore the older one could have perceived the situation entirely, Austin kicked his leg and fell on the floor with the Wizard above Austin and the latter's leg caging the Wizard's back in an unmovable hold.\n(A/N: - Imagine Luna appearing all of a sudden X-D )\n\"Let's burn.\"\nThe cold tone of the teenager resonated heavily in the Wizard's ears before the downfall of blazing heat poured down on both of them.\n[AHHHHH!!]\nEarlier, the Wizard was able to dodge Austin's attack through his precise levitation skill but now being captured, there was no way for the man to run away.\nLike a heavy cascade of the crimson blaze, both Austin and the Wizard got shrouded under the hellish curtains.\nEven the hero would have burnt to a cinder if such flames would have rained on him for too long which made the duo on the sidelines gasp at the scene in horror.\nThe Wizard was also hurting quite a lot. More than Austin thought as he saw the man struggling to get out of the hold but surprisingly, Austin was way stronger than the man when it came to such extreme situations.\n[You damn kid!!!]\nSuddenly the Wizard shouted as his robe left his body and extended like a sheet over both of them and countered the flames before the Wizard punched Austin right in the face.\n**BAM**\nAustin felt his nose bleeding but he didn't let go of the Wizard since he knew the robe wouldn't last long against the spirits.\n**BAM*BAM**\nBut Austin wasn't able to protect himself from getting punched since he was also restrained to move freely.\nBut something Austin didn't expect happened as a familiar voice rang in his senses and an overwhelming presence approached.\n\"You bastard! Let go of my Onii-sama!\"\nThe wicked smile on the Wizard's face returned as he smirked upon hearing the person he was triggering by hurting the blondie.\n\"Saya no!!\"\n__________________\nA/N: - How was the chapter?

Hmmph!!\"\nSaya tried her best to break free but from Austin's perception, that robe wasn't even moving even a bit. Only after entrapping Saya within fractions of seconds, the robe levitated away.\nThe turn of events happened in mere blinks and Austin was left shocked beyond belief. Only when he saw Saya being taken away, did he get out of his stupor and extended his hand to grab the man.\nBut it was too late…\n[Hahah! The pitiful soul got targetted just because of her love for her brother~]\nThe Wizard took the advantage of Austin's absent-mindedness as he flew away from the floor and levitated just beside his robe.\nSaya's struggling figure was right in Austin's view as he instantly got up and threw all his worries about the backlash of mana.\nBut before he could have flown off and gouge the life out of the shithead, some figures suddenly emerged out of nowhere and smashed Austin back to the ground with a strong thud.\n\"Fuck!\"\nAustin couldn't help but groan in annoyance as he saw the number of shadow slaves emerging in front. If they were regular slaves then Austin would have annihilated them with Spiritual Energy but no.\nWhat made Austin quite troubled since some minutes ago was now in more than one in quantity, standing tall and ready to engage in battle any moment now.\n[Thanks to you, their pseudo soul got destroyed and I can now summon them as much as I want.]\nAustin wasn't standing still to listen to the useless chatters as the Golems started raining down a barrage of front-on attacks.\nTheir strength wasn't like the original ones but in that quantity, it was almost impossible to get out unscathed.\n\"Argh!\"\nAustin tried to sneak between the gaps but the wizard suddenly fired strange energy from his finger which threw Austin back to the surface.\nOne of the Golem took the chance and slammed its massive fist just precisely at the place where Austin fell, further engraving a greater with the blond youth as its center.\nAustin felt massive damage surging from inside but he has to use his skill to reach Saya as soon as possible.\n[Gravity Manipulation]\nExtending his hand, Austin put pressure on the dozens of Golem but due to the constant jammer of his natural magical energy, the skill remained short of fulfilling its role.\nThe four who were near him fell flat on the ground just after Austin left the crater and dashed toward the nearest Golem.\nHe knew the Wizard won't let him save Saya until he doesn't defeat all the Golem and so he shall do so.\nGritting his teeth, Austin clenched his fist as his world seemed red due to the pressure he was feeling with the heavy amount of mana he released.\nBut he cared about none at the moment.\n**BOOOOM**\nA roaring blast echoed in the surroundings as Austin hit the Golem right in its abdomen before the gigantic thing could have blocked him.\nBut rather than being forced to take two steps back, the Golem wasn't harmed much and so it countered soon enough.\nThe Golem didn't hit the human rather it pressed its big hand on him and pushed the human down to the ground roughly.\nThis time the other undead Golems didn't wait and landed their foot on Austin one after another before the human could get back on his feet.\nThe sound of massive feet smashing to the ground restlessly made the empty floor horrifyingly noisy.\nKyouki could only grit his teeth in frustration since leaving his place would only mean leaving Cordelia to die. And the hero still believes that there was more to Austin, even though he knows it was just his wishful expectation.\nCordelia was growing pale to see that amount of terrifying beings stomping over the boy who seemed undefeatable some moments ago. The shift of events was too frightening to believe.\nAustin's Gravity Manipulation also faded away as he found himself struggling even to keep his eyes open by the brutal onslaught he came in contact with for the first time.\nHis half-open eyes were lingering on his sister who was still caged by the robe.\nHis thought process was getting clogged up as Austin ran across his brain to think what possibly he could do when suddenly something caught his partial vision.\nSaya's movement seemed to be slowing down all of a sudden. Like she is accepting her defeat.\nLike she is going to lose hope in her brother.\nLike he might never see her again.\nLike there won't be anyone who will call him Onii-sama again.\nLike… she…is going to…\n**SNAP**\nThe Wizard who was enjoying the show with his eyes curved suddenly widened his gaze as he felt something.\nSomething massive and furious from the place where the blondie is….or…was…\n_________________\nA/N: - Next chapter would be lit.

His condition was going severe as time passed due to the barrage of attacks that befell one after another on him.\nCordelia also was urging Kyouki to leave her and help Austin but suddenly her voice came to an abrupt halt as she also gazed upon the sudden change of events.\nThe Austin who was on the receiving end until now and seemed to be growing close to losing his consciousness or maybe his life any moment now suddenly rose up once again.\nBut unlike before he wasn't moving at his usual pace. Heck, he didn't even seem to be moving anymore. More like he was teleporting from one place to another as he commenced his offense.\nKyouki had never seen someone fight like that. Austin wasn't using any spell nor even Mana was leaking from him, but still, he was brawling with those Golems like he was thrashing newbie warriors.\nHis physical might was raised just like his speed and this time he wasn't even caring whether he was getting injured in the process of inflicting damage or not.\nHe was behaving like a battle-driven maniac who knew nothing more than to annihilate his enemies.\nBattle cries resonated as the strong onslaught landed at different corners of each Golem and sent them flying away in different directions.\nAustin wasn't just fighting right now. He was overwhelming the battle one-sidedly.\n'What have you become Austin… '\n_._._\nAustin was no more conscious of what he was doing. He was just moving on his instincts with his gaze lifelessly red in bloodthirst.\nHe could only think about one thing. And that was to annihilate his enemies in order to save his sister.\nHe no longer felt any kind of discomfort or any injuries. He just let go of the restraints which humans generally have in the name of humanity.\nThese were his enemies who were restricting him to rescue his sister. There was no point in showing them mercy. They are meant to be massacred in the cruelest way.\n**BOOOOM**\nAs Austin gathered his natural elemental blaze over his hand, he punched the weakest spot of the Golem and turned the whole thing into bits and pieces.\nThe other Golems started to gather in order to fight efficiently against the human but Austin cared about none.\nBefore they could have joined forces, he dashed with a speed that exceeded his limitation and appeared in front of one of the random Golems.\nLeaping high in the air, he didn't halt before taking out his war hammer and pummeling it down on the Golem's head with sheer force nothing else.\n**CRACK**\n**BOOOOM**\nAn audible crack erupted from the weapon because of the Golem's defense but it didn't stop the heaven shattering strike from destroying the head of the Golem and further leaving it lifeless.\nAustin never stopped any time as he lunged at the nearest Golem with his spear springing out of his inventory. Using Spear's skill [Penetration] he felt himself spinning in mid-air before his whole body with the weapon started to rotate at extreme speed.\nThe target was clear and the attack was precise.\n**THUD**\nAnother Golem dropped to the ground after Austin created a small yet impactful hole through the Golem's forehead.\nThe Spear was burnt enough to be of no more use as Austin threw it away and stood while facing three remaining Golems.\nHis body was dyed with his own blood and the remnants of the only living Golem he faced. But he wasn't in his sane mind to think about such things.\nHis bloodlust grew severe as the Golem launched themselves toward Austin from different directions.\nAustin leaped once again high in the air before he took out a particular chain from his inventory which was named [Curse Binder].\nThe chain doesn't require mana, rather the blood of the user in order to show its effect.\nAustin thoughtlessly, released the chains toward the three inhumane creatures which got enlarged as it approached its prey and successfully restrained the Golems with ease.\nA lot of blood was absorbed in the chains as the binding started to show its effect and the Golems started to erode slowly yet surely. Their struggle to be set free also slowed down due to the effect of 'SS' rank binders.\nThe only one left was-\n[You damn brat!]\nThe Wizard's face was pale as he suddenly landed over Austin and kicked the teenager's head with his whole might, intending to tear off Austin's head at the time he seemed most vulnerable.\nDue to the Curse Binders, even the Wizard was feeling the effect for some reason which made him furious at Austin and so he decided to stop playing around and kill the son of a bitch once and for all.\nBut it was a mistake on the Wizard's part to think that Austin would let his guard down just because he annihilated some measly Golems.\nDue to the force of the kick, Austin's head just only tilted to the right but he remained unmoved much to the older one's fret.\n['I have to retreat!

      "content": "The battle has concluded.\nThe previously wagging body of the Abyssal Wizard was now hopelessly lying on the cold ground as Austin stared at the man's pale white face, devoid of any emotions.\nAustin slew the Wizard without utilizing any mana or artifact and not even weapons. He just tore the floor master's limb one after another mercilessly with bite strength as the Wizard cried in agony all along.\nStomping his knee, ankle, toes, elbow, testicles… Autin made sure to crack every single breakable thing before he bisected the Wizard while enjoying his screams\nIn the process, the robe which was previously entrapping Saya flew toward Austin to save its master but failed.\nEven though Saya was set free and the mana-restricting curse was broken, Austin didn't stop in his torture. He was no longer fighting to save his sister. He just wanted to hear the Wizard's screams of misery and end his life in the cruelest way possible.\nSince the curse was ripped off, seemingly because of the Wizard's near-death condition, both Cordelia and Kyouki were unrestrained.\nThe first thing they did was to check on Saya since presently, they can only rely on her to stop Austin from his frenzy. Austin currently looked nothing but horrifying.\n\"Lia… the pill. It will work now.\"\nThe pill that Kyouki hurriedly asked for was a mana-stimulating pill, which triggers a person's dormant magical energy.\nSince there was no backlash they could feel while channelizing their mana, that pill would help Saya's natural essence to heal her.\nCordelia nodded, and after parting Saya's lips, she dropped the pill inside her mouth before Kyouki passed some water for Cordelia to pour down Saya's throat.\nOn the other side, Austin was done with his ordeal as he shredded the robe in bits and threw it away. The Wizard was only left with his armless upper body with his heart slowly numbing passing each second.\nEven so, his eyes were parted as the Wizard witnessed the cruelty that the blondie carried. The old man was just shocked would be an understatement. He was beyond petrified to meet such a being after a long time.\nBut even in face of death, the Abyssal Wizard had a smile plastered across his lips as he muttered his last of the words before Austin stomped his life away.\n[If… it's…you… I think*hah*...you might…defeat-]\n**CRACK**\nAnd with that, the end of the fifth stage master came to an end as Austin stepped on the man's heart and without hesitation crushed it.\nThere was still a smirk on the man's face as he felt his century's worth of life fading in the face of a single brat. But that smirk signified that he regretted nothing.\nNow there was someone who might…\n\"O-Onii-sama….\"\n**SNAP**\nHearing a familiar tone, Austin's gaze widened, and for the first time after a long while an expression of anxiety spread over his face.\nHurriedly he turned toward the source of the voice only to see the person for whom he started this massacre. The murderous daze took over his mind so profoundly that he forgot because of whom he ever fell into that state.\nRegret, sorrow, elation, and many other emotions vividly grew thick on Austin's face as he stepped toward his sister.\n\"Saya I-khak!!\"\n\"Onii-sama!!\"\nSaya limply got up with help of Cordelia as they followed Kyouki who reached for Austin first and helped the latter.\nAustin had his mouth wide agape as he tried to catch his breath. His face grew pale and his vision darkened severely.\nKyouki in a panic, laid Austin to the ground with his head on Kyouki's thigh in order to not let Austin choke.\n\"Hey, hey! Calm down and breathe, okay? Just relax and breathe properly.\"\nKyouki rubbed Austin's chest as he spoke in a hurried tone while the other two knelt on either side of Austin.\nNone of them had any idea what was wrong with Austin. Since mana should've been working properly there doesn't seem any reason for his sudden fall.\nSaya was crying non-stop while holding her brother's cold hand as she condemned herself for his condition. The chain of events has made her mind blank to even think properly at the moment.\nCordelia was checking his pulse and rubbed his palms to calm his nerves but to no avail. His life was evidently leaving his shell as the remnants of his mana depleted dangerously.\nKyouki was the only one yelling at Austin to calm down with tears also moistening his eyes. He just doesn't know what he should do and only could blame his incapability that Austin had to force himself to this extent.\nEven though the threat of the Wizard had subdued, the group was in deep desperation. If not, greater degree than before.\nThe person who fought for them. The person who saved their worthless life was now falling into a slumber that seemed no way of returning yet they could only watch him die while crying like a loser!\nAt times every hope seemed to diminish, a familiar voice resonated heavily on the labyrinth floor, making the three flinch in expectation and slight horror as well.\n\"I left my husband to you guys just for a few hours and this is how you have taken care of him?!\"\n_________________\nA/N: - Stalker for once, stalker for life.\nI hope you guys liking the story so far.

The hero, after telling the full story, stepped back as he stood beside the other two while waiting for the evident upset Luna's next words.\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, Luna's chilling tone finally reached up to the three but the most startled one was the person who got targeted by her words.\n\"Weren't you a Demi-God ranked or something, Saya? Is that just for show or you deliberately left your brother in trouble in order to see how much he loves you?\"\nSaya wanted to say something but in the end, she only bit her lip until a small stream of blood didn't start pouring down.\nEven though her words were hurtful and sharp, Saya knew she deserved it. And not only that, a lot more than this.\nDespite being strong and training for so damn long, she was nothing more than dead weight for her brother who brought him into such a state.\nShe was nothing more than a disgrace who doesn't have the right to live anymore!\n\"Try to hurt yourself and you will find your brother in more pain when he wakes up. I don't care at all, but I don't want my husband to be sad, so stay right there.\"\nSaya flinched upon witnessing Luna's perception, who without even looking at Saya could tell what she was thinking at the moment.\nShe really deserves to be on her brother's side.\n\"I… I am sorry Luna… I just… I-I just couldn't save him….\"\nMore tears rolled down her cheeks as she stuttered those words somehow.\nLuna sighed as she kept her gaze focused on the man for whom she had tolerated this foolish girl until now.\n\"If your brother wakes up, the last thing he would want to see would be your crying face. Cry how much you want but not now, since I wouldn't like to see any discomfort on my Austin's face.\"\nKyouki was astonished to see how selfish Luna has become to only care about Austin. But then again, it was the best way to console Saya in such a situation. After all, both the ladies had only a single weakness.\n'Lucky bastard… '\n…________________…\n[Austin's POV:]\n'Am I floating… '\nThe most recognizable thing I remember was seeing Saya limply walking in my direction when I felt a sensation protruding inside my body somewhere. And it hurt like hell!\nThe most painful thing was that I wasn't able to discern where I was hurting but it pained like my very soul would get ripped off from my body to escape this suffering.\n'How this started again… '\nI had a vague recollection of a notification that popped out in front of my retina when I was getting beaten down and saw Saya losing her strength inside that robe.\nI felt so pathetic at that time.\nI still had no idea what that notification was but I am sure it was a skill that flipped and helped me fight those huge golems.\nRight now I have no idea where I am or where I would end up. I won't be dying that's for sure since I have the Moon-stone.\nBut this feeling was creepy. It was the same as when I was reincarnating.\nPitch black surrounded me while I floated uncontrollably as I felt eyes on me from everywhere. Like someone is watching me yet I couldn't point my finger where this person or thing was.\nIt was eerie, to say the least.\nWhile I have the time I can think about my future and what I might be doing from now on.\nI might sound optimistic but there was a certain warmth over my chest which assured my safety.\n'Hmm… It's better that I get control over other nations as soon as possible… '\nThe rebirth of the Monarch of Darkness was now two years away if I take the main plot into account. But now the plot no longer matters\nI pretty much fucked up the story a long ago when I got first in contact with Luna. Not like I care. I feel fortunate that the plot shifted and I got my fair share of happiness in the face of my adorable Saintess.\n'I better hide about this fight with that Wizard Bastard from her… '\nI made a mental note to not tell Luna about this battle and also to make sure that those three do not speak a single word about this whole situation.\nLuna might be adorable and such but when it comes to my safety she becomes quite scary. She would pretty much tie a leash on me and won't let me go for a week, to say the least.\n'Well, that won't be that bad… '\nShooing away my perverted thoughts I felt a bright star shining in this endless darkness before I started to get sucked into it.\nMy thoughts were fixed on how to console Saya and convince the three to not speak a word about this incident to Luna.\nBut little did I expect that the first person greeting me would be….\n\"Ah, you woke up darling~.\"\n________________…\nA/N: - Luna is quite agitated with the three so her attitude was justifiable.\nPlease drop a comment if you are liking the story~",

      "content": "It was around two hours since the Abyssal Wizard was defeated and an unexpected yet welcomed person arrived.\nAfter Austin came back to his senses, Luna asked everyone to give them space before she chanted a barrier around the two.\nKyouki and Cordelia went to a corner as they treated each other with the first aid kit they had in Kyouki's pouch. They didn't have many injuries but the accumulated stress was much needed to be released.\nSaya just stepped backward but didn't move her gaze from the place where she knew her brother was. She didn't have the capability or intention to pry into Luna and her brother's intimate moments, but the greed to meet her brother as soon as possible didn't let her move away.\nDespite being tired both physically and mentally, Saya was standing still with her gaze frozen at the same spot.\n_._._\nInside the dome, Austin lay down on the floor with his upper body completely exposed.\nLuna did treated him but the blood stains were still there and so was her own assurance. She couldn't sit still until she doesnt check all his injuries by herself.\n\"Hey.\"\n\"...\"\nIt was the third time, Austin called for her but Luna still didn't reply and continued to clean him with warm water and soft towels. Her eyes were filled with concern but whenever she heard his voice her gaze turned slightly cold.\nAustin was even restricted to move his limbs since Luna was binding his limbs with mana.\nBeing annoyed a little, Austin spoke without minding whether she responds but it somehow backfired or not.\n\"Hey, it alright now. As you see, I am quite fine-\"\n\"Fine huh?\"\nLuna finally turned her chilling gaze in his direction making Austin shut up in an instant. Her hand which rubbed the towel gently came to an abrupt halt as she finally began to wail out her build-up anxiety.\n\"You know how hard it was for me to see you like that? After being separated for so long, I was greeted with a half-dead Austin…do you know what would have gone across my heart. I felt burning this world and the things inside it who dared to hurt you! To hurt the person I love!! And here you…hick..\"\nAmidst reprimanding, tears started rolling down her fluffy cheeks when Austin instantly broke free of her frail binds and held Luna in his arms.\nLuna also didn't resist and let herself get wrapped in her favorite warmth as she rested her head on his chest while he rubbed her back gently.\n\"Don't cry now. You know it pains me the most when I see you like this. I know it was reckless of me to go overboard but you know if it comes to you or Saya, I just lose it. And I knew, even if I push myself to the point which I can't afford, you will save me, somehow. So please don't be sad anymore. I am completely fine now.\"\nAustin kept on consoling and pampering the weeping Luna that he was alright but only she knows how she felt when her eyes landed on the lifeless Austin. If not for her arriving another minute, then he might have lost his life.\nThere indeed was a stone that would have bestowed him with another life but still, Luna was utterly distressed about the idea to let Austin die in the first place. She couldn't even think of that moment when he closes his eyes before her…\nIt took some time but Luna seemed to calm down after his continuous comforting and assuring her about his well-being.\n\"Baka….always making me worried…\"\nLuna bit on his nape in the complaint which Austin accepted wholeheartedly. If it quells her pain he would let her bite as much as she wants.\n\"I swear if you dare to let yourself get hurt like that again… I will chain you up and never will let you go away from my sight.\"\nAustin trembled slightly as he thought that Luna might have some y-dere traits but he shooed those thoughts away and hugged her even more tightly.\n\"Mm…whatever you say…\"\n_______________…\nAfter more than half an hour of recharging herself enough to survive for a day and two, Luna disintegrated the barrier making the three outside, startled.\nSaya stepped forward as she saw Luna walking forward while hugging her brother cozily. Compared to earlier it felt like even flowers might bloom if planted under her feet at the moment.\nHowever, Saya's gaze only lingered her for a moment before her gaze fell on the man beside her. Messy blond hair, evidently ragged condition but healthy enough that he was able to walk properly, and a pair of eyes that radiated nothing but genuine concern for her.\nHer brother's face and outer appearance might have changed but the emotions he carries in those eyes were still the same as she remember. Seeking out for her even though she messes up a big time. Or whenever she felt lonely, he would extend his arms just like he was doing now…\n\"Why do you look so dazed? Come here.\"\nSaya trodded feebly for some steps before she fell into her brother's arms, leaving all the worries and exhaustion she has been weighted down with.\nLuna gave the two some space as she approached the duo standing still in the corner.\n'Well, she deserved that much… '\n__________________…\nA/N: - The last phrase was actually Luna thinking about the harsh words she used upon arrival. Even the saintess feels emotions toward someone other than Austin.\nAnyway, lemme know if you guys liked the chapter.",

      "content": "\"So what's the plan from now on, Captain?\"\nAs Austin returned to the group while holding his sister's hand fondly, Luna asked in a mild tone. She couldn't help but feel a little bitter after she saw how close these two are and also how protectively Austin was holding Saya's hand.\nEven though she was the one who encouraged Saya to go after Austin, Luna wasn't actually entirely ready for this change. Thanks to the fact that Austin was a little dense when it came to matters like this, it was providing Luna with the time she required to adapt.\n\"After some rest, we will be moving further down. Since the curse of mana has been lifted, it would be easier to venture.\"\nLuna expected such an answer from him. Earlier Austin told her when they were in the dome, that the floor boss was aware of Austin's Villain System.\nIt goes without saying that Austin must be impatient and anxious to know more about his system's origin and things that may be about his rebirth.\nLuna undoubtedly was going to support him from hereon but for some reason, something was weighing down her heart. Like they might come to know something not-so-pleasant.\n'Ah, I have to collect myself… '\nShaking her head, Luna threw her useless thoughts as she turned toward Austin. Whatever happens, she wasn't going to leave his side.\n\"We are also ready to go.\"\nIt was Kyouki who declared for him and his partner's stead as he stood while supporting Cordelia. The latter mentioned was slightly pale-faced due to being constantly influenced by the Wizard but other than that she seemed fine.\nHowever, before Austin could have nodded and proceed with his further plan, Luna interjected.\n\"Your lovers might die at the rate they have been crying since forever.\"\nKyouki perked his ears as his lashes blinked in perplexion upon hearing Luna's remark which undoubtedly was targeted at Sicily and Lilia.\n\"What happened to them?\"\nIt has been only a week since they dived into the dungeon so Kyouki didn't find any reason for them to get worried so soon.\nHowever, the hero and everyone present inside got startled upon hearing Luna's following reality check.\n\"Well, of course not seeing their loved one for a month would make them worried. And they are aware of me entering this place so…\"\nLuna trailed off her words since she knew Kyouki had understood the essence of the matter.\nThe reason Luna dived into the labyrinth must be because of some unforeseen circumstance. And having no way to check on Kyouki's condition would undoubtedly make them uneasy.\n\"Yeah, you should go back Hero.\"\nKyouki turned toward his team captain with a bitter expression since he was utterly conflicted about what he should be doing now.\nIt didn't take time for Austin to know what the hero was thinking as he sighed and approached the raven-haired youth.\n\"Listen, your job is finished. You assisted me enough until now. Even with the wizard, I primarily thought of using you as the final strike but well…\"\nKyouki was a little taken aback since Austin rarely talked in such a manner with him before. Soon his expression loosened up since what Austin said made the hero slightly less guilty for being just a dead weight.\nWith a contended look Kyouki nodded along with his words.\n\"Okay, I will return now. And you too, don't go rampaging like a maniac again.\"\nAustin narrowed his eyes and smacked the hero in the torso.\n\"Buah!\"\n\"That maniac saved your ass, hero. Now get going.\"\nCordelia rubbed Kyouki's back in concern as the latter held his stomach in mild pain because of the punch. But amidst pain Kyouki had a snicker plastered on his face as he saw Austin retreating back to Luna's side.\nLuna was surprised to see that Kyouki and Austin have grown closer than before and the attitude of the hero toward Austin has also shifted a lot.\n\"I-I will be leaving with Kyo-chan as well.\"\n\"Hmm, alright.\"\nCordelia bowed after some time before she went to Kyouki's side and enveloped both of them in her shadow.\nKyouki gave a last glance at the blond youth with a nod as the darkness covered them before their presence vanished all in an instant.\nLeft were the three still on the fifth floor. Saya's condition was better than before. Luna was beautiful and smiling as ever. And Austin himself after Luna's care felt a lot better.\nAustin was about to use his skill to penetrate through the floor and continue his venture along with the two beauties when a familiar yet unpleasant voice reached up to them.\n[Where do you think you guys are going?]\n________________…\nA/N: - I wanted to add another scene but it would have gotten a whole lot longer.

      "content": "The person who brought this much trouble for Austin after so long a time. The man who nearly killed him. And the bastard who dared to hurt his sister as well was yet again standing in front of the three.\nHowever, from close observation, it became clear that the person standing all tall and arrogant was no longer a living existence. Rather, just a fragment of his soul.\n[You guys don't even seem surprised. How boring.]\nThe Abyssal Wizard pouted like a kid as if the person who was doing his all to kill Austin was someone else entirely.\nHowever, the whiny expression of the Wizard soon shifted exponentially as he sensed a peculiar energy radiating from the silver-haired girl.\nLuna had no motive to let this chance go. This was the opportunity to bestow the most painful death to the insect who dared to hurt her husband.\nThe Wizard realized that he might vanish from existence since the creepy girl had Holy Magic overflowing around her. Even being alive, the man was sure that he would've lost to such an absurd level of raw mana.\n\"Do you have anything useful to say?\"\nAustin gently wrapped his hand around Luna's waist before she could have gone berserk.\nEven being angry, Luna seemed extremely adorable to let go. And also, he had a hunch that this useless Wizard might deliver some information related to the thing waiting beneath them.\nLuna understood Austin's intention but still, it was too much to ask for. She just wanted to slice a limb or two for starters. That much wouldn't have killed the pest.\nHowever, she didn't protest against Austin and obediently stood at her spot.\nThe Abyssal Wizard sighed in relief as the overwhelming killing intent was pulled back temporarily.\n[Yes… I, as the guardian of this Labyrinth, allow you and your party to proceed further. But before you face the being resting at the base of this abyss, I want to request you guys something.]\nThe first half of his statement seemed utter bullshit since Austin didn't require any approval now to proceed further. But what intrigued the three was the Wizard's following words.\nWith a deep frown, the Wizard continued.\n[The one resting on the tenth stage of this place has the knowledge of your System and the person who caused so many troubles for you. But beware of one thing…]\nSaya frowned slightly since she was entirely unaware of what system this robed bastard was talking about. However, from her brother's expression, it seemed that this matter contained extreme concern.\nJust as Saya and Luna could see, Austin indeed had a severe frown on his head as he waited for the Wizard to continue. If things really go as desired then Austin may find various answers he has been pursuing for a long time.\nHis tone grew slightly mild like he was trying to not let someone else lurking around hear it, the wizard continued.\n[...don't piss her off whatever it takes. Once her tolerance level reaches a point she might explode and also take down the place situated above the Labyrinth.]\nAustin understood what this Wizard was trying to imply.\nIf the person on the tenth floor gets annoyed then she might eradicate the whole of Eden's Academy at once. Well, Austin doesn't believe what he has yet to witness but there was no harm to keep Wizard's warning in mind.\n\"You done right? Now let me slaughter you.\"\nLuna instantly got away from Austin's grip and approached the Wizard at a frightening speed.\n[Hehe… not so easy there… ]\nBut the wizard was able to escape by converting himself into a shadow and blending in the darkness.\nLuna's eyes glittered with cyan radiance as she used her skill to trace the bastard but…\n\"He's moving continuously. I better destroy this whole floor.\"\nSince the Wizard's consciousness remained only in his soul, he was able to use himself as a shadow and kept on moving to dodge any kind of lethal blow.\nLuna made her decision to bring this whole place into rumbles to see the despair on that creature's face and kill him slowly while listening to his agonizing screams.\nBut before she could have started, Austin held her hand and pulled her in an embrace.\n\"That's okay, Luna. He's already dead. Killing him again would gain us nothing. I am happy that you are angry in my stead but I think it's best to stop here and focus on the final destination.\"\nLuna, who was getting into her battle mode suddenly felt the warmth of her man enveloping her, before her eyes lost the glint they carried for the Wizard.\nThe Saintess whined like a child as she complained with a bulge appearing on her left cheek.\n\"You always forgive anyone so easily.\"\nAustin sighed in awe upon seeing the childish protest as he tried to calm down the troubled Luna.\n\"That's why we are the most balanced couple, aren't we?\"\nLuna quit struggling upon hearing the flirtatious comment as she dipped her face, deep into his chest while trying to hide her embarrassment.\nAustin laughed lightly as he extended his hand toward Saya who was cautiously keeping her eyes on their surroundings.\nSeeing her brother's approach, she instantly jumped forward and leaned slightly to place his hand on top of her head.\nWhile pampering the ladies, Austin's eyes looked intently at the base on which they were standing as a thought emerged in his mind.\n'Let's see who is the mighty creator of this wonderful system… '\n______________________\nA/N: - Drop a comment if you are liking the story so far~",

      "content": "The rest of the four floors were nothing but a walk in the park since the restriction on Mana was lifted.\nSaya wanted to ask about this System thing that the Wizard told them about but Austin assured her that it would be better for them to first clear this matter with Labyrinth.\nHe knew it was unfair of him to not tell Saya something so crucial about himself but right now, Saya was not in much stable mind to handle such a not-so-pleasant past.\nShe does have the right to know since Austin has never hidden anything from her and the same was for Saya as well, but right now, it would only make things worse for Saya.\nLuna was easily sweeping away the bosses and mob creatures on each floor since she didn't want Austin to strain himself anymore.\nSince she seemed very comfortable in annihilating those masses, Austin just stood at his place while being awestruck as they fluently dashed through the floors.\n\"Are we ready?\"\nOn the ninth floor. Standing in the middle of an empty hall that previously was filled with strange blue slime creatures, Luna asked in a serene tone regarding advancement.\nAustin looked at Saya who nodded albeit a little hesitantly as she strengthen her hold on her brother's hand.\nAustin knew why she and even Luna were nervous despite not showing outwardly but there was no way he would be returning after coming this far.\nNodding toward his girl, Austin and the others felt the ground rumbling before a small crater was formed, and through sheer force of heavy mana, Luna made a hole through the floor.\nAustin controlled their gravity to make the fall slower as their eyes wandered the whole floor.\nGenerally, some creatures would have already latched at them as soon the ceiling of the new floor disappeared but not on this tenth floor.\nStrangely, there was no presence whatsoever around. But that doesn't mean they didn't find someone on the floor who possibly was the final boss.\nIn the middle of the floor there planted a queen-sized bed with a crown like a headboard and a pink net curtain canopy over the furniture. Just like how a little princess would want their bed to be.\nThe three of them didn't land much further from the bed and they were able to see the person lying on the bed.\nThere was no snow white princess but an old hag clearly in her eighties with white hair spread all over her pink pillow. The small sleeping cap didn't make her look any childish or younger, rather the scent of cringe only reeked profoundly.\n\"Should we wake the granny up?\"\nSaya proposed the idea since despite being not the kind of being they primarily were expecting, this old lady was the only source to gain the knowledge for which her Onii-sama was so anxious about.\nAustin was contemplating a bit since it seemed rude to wake such elderly who have been sleeping so peacefully. But Luna had different plans.\n\"Austin~Can I have some money?\"\nAustin was perplexed by such a sudden and unexpected request but he didn't deny it and instantly pulled out a thousand gold coin pouches from his inventory.\n\"Don't you earn a lot already?\"\nSaya asked in genuine confusion, but soon she regretted opening her mouth.\n\"You won't understand the happiness of asking money from a husband~.\"\nWith those words, Luna started walking backward, with her face still toward the blushing girl who clearly was borderline offended but slightly tempted to feel the sensation that Luna told about.\nAustin had no idea what Luna meant but he felt slightly bothered thinking about Saya's marriage. Well, it must be his protectiveness toward his innocent little sister.\nLuna soon twirled on her toes and faced the sleeping woman who had no effect even though Luna was just some meters away from killing her.\nAustin and Saya also slowly followed the suit and walked toward the scene where they saw Luna bringing up the pouch of gold coins before jerking it slowly.\n**CLINK*CLINK**\nLuna felt happy that Austin doesn't hold back in spending money when it came to her. But due to the heavy amount, the coin made a slightly dull noise.\nHowever, it was enough to fulfill the purpose for which Luna shook the coins for.\n\"I will do the job!\"\nThe woman instantly shot her eyes and spoke the first thing which came to her mind upon hearing such a melodious tune.\nLuna knew that the woman was a Witch who can do almost everything if given the right amount. It was not a commonly known knowledge that was why Austin and Saya seemed oblivion about this old hag.\nThe witch straightened her back and turned toward the pouch intending to latch at the bag and greet her eyes with her favorite shining shade.\nBut Luna was not here to deliver free lunch.\n\"Not so easy woman. If you want this and five more of the same amount then you have to tell me everything about someone.\"\nThe Witch had a mastered ability to count the coins just upon hearing its clink and she can tell that the pouch had four digits coins no less!\nAnd five more of this just for information?\n\"About whom tell me. I will expose every single thing about the person. From birth to death…nothing is hidden from these eyes of mine.\"\nLuna frowned upon hearing the word 'Death' associated with Austin but she didn't say anything for now. Moving to a side she gave space for her husband to walk forward.\nThe Witch sensed a boy and woman walking in her direction but her vision was not clear because of her dying age.\nPutting up her round glasses she turned toward the subject whom she seemingly have to appraise.\nHowever as soon the Witch saw Austin's face, her movement halted abruptly and mouth parted agape.\nThe remaining vigor from her face paled right at the instant as a single drop of tear rolled down the Witch's left eye.\n\"Y-You……\n_________________..\nA/N: - Drop a comment if you are liking the story so far~",

      "content": "Witches are folklore creatures even for Austin's new world where things like mana and demons were a reality.\nDwarves, Witches, Elves, Vampires, and many other fantasy beings are often discussed and people knew they existed but no one found any evident clue to prove their presence.\nOne of those fairy book subjects—a Witch—is known to be a being who is equivalently greedy as goblins have the talent to alter even the universal law.\nIt was known widely that in return for a decent sum, a witch can do anything for anyone regardless of the person's intention behind it. And after Luna went for the venture where she found Venessa, she can say that indeed Witches only care for gold nothing else.\nBut right now something that could be called, being entirely out of character, a witch was actually shedding tears just upon witnessing Austin in front?\nLuna was undoubtedly shocked just like the other two, but an ominous sensation made her feel uncomfortable all over. She knew there was something unpleasant to come that Luna might hate to learn.\nBut, was there anything she could do rather than face the reality?\n\"W-What happened? Why are you crying?\"\nAustin walked forward and asked in a fluster since the old granny looked rather pitiful crying like this all of a sudden.\nThe witch was quite touched seeing the gesture as she tried to somehow collect herself.\nShe knew this moment would be arriving as soon she felt spiritual energy channelizing above her head but still that doesn't help her to get prepared for this situation.\nWiping away her tears which greeted the lady after who knows how long, she spoke in a hoarse voice.\n\"Please sit down, first.\"\nWith such words, the three of the guests felt the surroundings altering in real-time before they found themselves, sitting around a tea table.\nEven Luna wasn't able to trace the transition of the magic and by no means she was happy about being outplayed.\n\"What would you like? Tea, coffee?\"\n\"How about we start with some truth?\"\nLuna's straightforward response which probably both Saya and Austin also were wanting to hear, made the old lady sigh in defeat.\nWhile still wearing her night pajamas and round glasses resting over her long nose, the white-haired woman took the fourth seat, which was in between Luna and Saya.\n\"The essence of that beast has made you quite short-tempered.\"\nLuna narrowed her gaze coldly since she realized what the witch was speaking about.\nSaya and Austin perplexedly blinked at each other before they turned their gazes toward Luna who not long after cleared their doubts.\n\"Say another word about my grandmother and you may be sharing a table with your sister.\"\nThe beast which the old woman referred to, was Luna's grandmother who has trained the girl for years and undoubtedly poured her essence into Luna throughout the time.\nSince Saya and Austin knew those godly beings as Guardian Deity, the old witch's referral made them baffled.\nRegarding a deity as a beast was truly a little…\nHearing Luna's clear threat, the old woman just smiled with a shake of her head as she magically brought a set of cutlery and a hot teapot over the table.\n\"You killed Liliana huh? Well, not like I cared about that corrupted bitch.\"\nAustin looked toward Luna in hope of hearing what this old lady was talking about.\nLuna previously thought to talk about this after clearing this mess out and after having a good night rest. But well, since the topic was brought up, there wasn't anything Luna sought to hide.\n\"The person who created that Mana restrictor was also a Witch whom I found some days ago. Apart from being forced by some unknown entity, she didn't provide much intel.\" (Luna)\nAustin didn't have to ask what Luna must have done after scraping out the information and he was pretty satisfied with it.\nThat artifact was the reason why Luna fell into such miserable conditions during the war. There was nothing less than death that could have compensated for such a sin.\n\"You did a great job, out there.\"\nGently squeezing her hand over the table, Austin spoke in a soft tone making Luna smile in glee as she enjoyed the blissful moment.\nBeing complimented by her darling was the best thing she could count on until this date.\nThere was a small smile hanging on the old woman's lips but soon it disappeared as she remembered what has to come in the youngster's life.\n\"Are you okay, ma'am?\"\nSaya asked in an unsure tone since she was reading the Witch's expression all this time. The sudden shift of emotions was so vivid that Saya felt slightly scared of the lady's thoughts about her Onii-sama.\nAfter pouring down the milk tea into four cups, the lady swirled the teapot back into thin air before she looked at Austin and spoke in a weak tone.\n\"My life is nearing its end. So please, I request you to consider before trying to kill me.\"\nIt was evident that the woman was pleading to Austin with those words but that was quite baffling.\nThere was no reason for Austin to kill the lady until she doesn't attack him first. And taking her behavior into the account, it doesn't seem she was interested in fighting them whatsoever.\n\"Why would I… attack you…?\"\nAustin's query was to be expected but the woman's following words made clear all the doubts in one go.\n\"The one who created this Villain's system while keeping you as the primary subject was none other than me.\"\n_______________________\nA/N: - I did say, this labyrinth would unfold a lot of truth and move the plot drastically.\nDrop a comment if you are liking the story so far~",

      "content": "Austin always thought that in each of his lives he always faced what someone calls, a misfortune that he never deserved.\nHe never whined but not like Austin was entirely ignorant about it.\nIn his past life, he had to struggle for everything which a normal boy of his age should just receive without him even requesting.\nHe faced the evils of society and had to go through things that made Austin quite detached from reality and live a life of complete isolation.\nAt those times, only a single person reached a helping arm to him and made Austin aware of the brighter side of his life.\nThe person who never asked anything in return and always used to provide him with the share of happiness Austin deserved.\nHis little sister Saya.\nUndoubtedly, Saya was the reason why Austin never fell into the darkness and came to hate this world for the way it was. Saya was the primary reason why Austin became the person he is in the present.\nAnd Austin felt lucky to receive such life and got the chance to be reborn to meet Luna.\n…..but now, someone out of nowhere was telling him that all the life he spent in his previous vessel was a part of a plan?\nThat all the misery he went through and the reason why Saya ever coincidentally came into his contact…was just to prepare him for the next life?\n\"Don't spout bullshit! I never met Onii-sama by mere luck. I was attracted to his kindness that's why I approached him!\"\nSaya enraged shout broke the cutlery on the table as she cleared her point. It was not just a stroke of luck that she got close to her brother. And she was not going to take that crap by staying silent!\nThe older woman sighed without complaint and replied in a weak tone.\n\"Then can you tell me, why you were the only one who was able to identify his kindness but not anyone else? How come you always saw him at times when your brother was in the middle of helping someone or partaking in any good deeds? Please don't say something childish like it was fate or your brother was a social helper whose daily task was to assist people in need. We both know that's pure excuses.\"\nThe anger in Saya's eyes diminished slowly as she kept her mouth agape, intending to rebuke the Witch but after registering each of the words, Saya was left speechless.\nSaya was hating herself to question those moments which connected her with her brother. Now the old hag has told her something like this, it was impossible for Saya to not think anything otherwise of those chance encounters with her brother.\n(A/N: - I might detail why she even started questioning herself.)\nLuna was not completely sure of what reason Saya ever started regarding Austin, her brother but the Saintess has confirmed the strong bond between the two.\nHowever, now things are starting to seem different because of Saya's silence on the matter.\n…and it was a little disheartening as well.\n\"So what was the purpose of carving my life in such a way? And why did I receive this system?\"\nThe eyes of the two ladies turned instantly toward their beloved.\nUnlike Saya and Luna, Austin had a naturally calm expression spread over his face like what he heard was something he already expected.\nIf Luna didn't have felt Austin's hand clutching hers under the table, she might have gotten worried.\nHe's in utter chaos but right now, Austin felt utilizing his priority in something else that would be beneficial to the future.\nSaya also sensed the motive behind her brother's demeanor and decided to shut her mouth despite having hundreds of things to shout.\nHearing the query, the old woman kept her gaze fallen on the table as she responded in a grieving tone.\n\"We wanted a perfect human who would be bestowed with the Villain's System but doesn't exploit it. As you have seen, the system provides you with a marvelous reward that can turn a nobody into a single-man army. We wanted a person who does not misuse the resource and when the time comes, he can utilize the system in the best possible way.\"\nThe statement had some of the points which cleared Austin's previous doubts but a bunch of new questions arrived as well.\nHe took his time to sort all the stuff and raise the first thing he felt complicated about.\n\"And who is this 'we'you are talking about?\"\nLuna also had a very urgent itch to know about this reference to an unknown entity.\nThe Witch slapped her forehead lightly in the realization of how basic things she forgot to add to her explanation.\n\"I did tell you that I created the Villain's system but that was a request from my customer. And those are the customers who made it possible to change your fate in the first place. The beings who reside above all of us or what I call them, The Administrators.\"\nAustin glanced at Luna with an equally perplexed expression as hers before he followed up with words.\n\"Gods?\"\n\"Yes, you can call them that.\"\nFor a second Austin felt that the lady was indeed speaking nothing but bullshit but he felt some sensation from Luna's side.\nTurning his head, he found Luna almost pale-faced like never before as she raised one of her own doubts.\n\"H-Hey what was your na-name again?\"\nThe old lady frowned her brows slightly as she tilted her head and spoke in an unsure tone.\n\"Amanda Ravewing. I never introduced myself?\"\nAustin was not focused on the forgetful behavior of the witch but rather on Luna's reaction. Suddenly, he heard a voice in his head that cleared the clouds.\n'Austin…whatever she is telling might be true. '\nIt was telepathy. A branch of Space magic that was not impossible for a brilliant mage like Luna which didn't bring any shocked expression on Austin's face as he heard her continuing.\n'My grandma told me whom to be wary of… And Amanda Ravewing was on top of that list… '\nLuna could never have imagined that no one else but the most ancient Witch in existence would be waiting down here in the labyrinth.\nThe being whom even her grandma called to be unpredictable yet on the other realm from every guardian deity in existence.\nAmanda Ravewing wasn't just a witch but a presence who holds the ability to write over the reality of numerous with a wave of the hand and also become the cause of their demise.\nWhen such a being says that she has been in contact with God, then there was no possible option rather than to believe her words.\nAustin was worried about Luna's condition but he chose to focus on the matter at hand first.\nTurning toward the old lady, Austin moved to the very question which may decide where he might be leading from hereon.\n\"Then what is the purpose of this Villain's System?\"\n_________________…\nA/N: - Next chapter would probably conclude the Labyrinth arc but well, since I don't want to rush Austin's origin, I might take two more chapters.",

      "content": "\"Before I tell you the reason why I ever created this system, I want to ask you something.\"\nAustin blinked in perplexion since he didn't have any idea what she would be asking even though his life cycle was pretty much monitored by the lady.\nWithout thinking much, he nodded before the woman leaned slightly forward as her eyes radiated with somewhat severity.\n\"If the Demon Lord and the First Guardian Deity once again engage in a heaven-shattering war… which side would you pick?\"\nThat was not some tricky inquiry from the lady's side since anyone who has been living among the humans while being shadowed by the protection of the Guardian Deities would answer in their favor.\nDemons are creatures who know nothing out of destruction and chaos. Siding with them would be utterly foolish for distinct reasons.\nNot to talk about Luna's relationship with her grandma or to say a Guardian Deity. Luna had the essence of a heavenly being so there seemed only an obvious route to walk upon.\nHowever…\n\"I will not take any side if war really breaks out.\"\nThe expression on Saya and the Witch's faces evidently took a turn of surprise as they heard Austin's non-hesitant response.\nLuna was sitting with her eyes unfocused since she was already aware of what her husband had thought of their future. And she had no problem with such an opinion at all.\n\"You won't take either side? But why? With your strength and coupled with your women you can easily overwhelm your opposition with a huge margin.\"(Amanda)\nIt was true that Austin had a lot of room for growth before the resurrection of the Demon Lord takes place and not to talk about Saya and Luna's assistance.\nBut Austin has already thought about this a long time ago and he still adhered to his beliefs rigidly.\n\"I have learned a long time ago to never follow what others force you to believe. Not every time Gods are a source of prosperity and not every time Demons tend to bring detriment. I just seek my own happiness and for that this world can burn all it wants.\"\nHolding Luna and Saya's hands on either side, Austin smiled in satisfaction as the conclusion followed soon after.\n\"Just a small space where I can spend the rest of my life with my loved ones would be enough for me.\"\nAustin felt he was sounding like an old man but it was what he desired and could go to greater degrees to attain.\nA life where his lover and sister can coexist with him would be everything Austin could demand. He never sought strength or he would have taken advantage of his system. Neither he liked fame or any other superficial source of happiness to pretend like a happy man.\nHe just wants to live in peace.\n\"Never thought I would be hearing such a thing from such a young boy.\"\nAustin frowned slightly since what he suspected of himself, the witch worded it out. But he also agrees that his thoughts really don't match his appearance.\nAfter showcasing a small smile, the old lady leaned back on her chair as she started narrating Austin's previous query.\n\"You were granted this system because there would be a time when the world would become a literal hell. Demons and Humans would collide and world-shattering chaos would erupt.\"\nAustin was no longer concerned whether Amanda got the answer she desired or not from him. What made him and the other two concerned was the news she broke.\nWith her eyes oozing with a single emotion of concern, Amanda finished the part of her prophecy.\n\"And that war would end up swallowing each and every existence from the globe. The vegetation would dry up and so would be mana.\"\nThe atmosphere further grew heavy upon hearing the possible future that the Witch had spoken about.\nMight be this all bullshit but the war everyone has been expecting after the rebirth of Demon Lord may conclude in the same way which Amanda just conveyed.\nThe thought of such a world was nothing short of frightening.\nTaking a massive factor of concern aside, without mana the world would naturally die out since, like any human being, the planet requires mana as it's a fundamental necessity.\nIt was indeed dreadful.\n\"W-what if I stop Demon Lord from its rebirth?\" (Austin)\n\"Then you will invite the inevitable destruction on a sooner date.\"\nAustin was left speechless since there was only one thing he could think of to prevent the war. And that was to stop the Monarch of Darkness from regaining his grip on the reins.\nBut that would make things worse…?\nNo one had any idea what to say anymore as Austin leaned back on the chair in utter disbelief before the old lady continued.\n\"Listen Austin. This system was provided for you to stand in between the two forces and take necessary measures to stop the destruction. I know it might sound ridiculous but this is the sole purpose why the Gods groomed you and I instilled that system.\"\nAfter she finished speaking, heavy silence dominated the space as Austin stared at nothing constant while registering what the lady stated just now.\nIt was true that with the system he felt he could become something more. A better version of himself.\nBut standing against Deities and Demon Lord?\nThat's nothing less than suicide since neither side is, just powerful. They are literal Planetary level beings who cannot be compared to Captain Charles or Alex Nuèye.\nHell, their comparison is basically impossible.\nThe Demon King and the First Deity who has taken the role of Gram's guardianship are not the existence to ever be taken lightly.\nAnd to think Austin would be standing as a sole force against these two?\n\"I know your system gives a lot of overpowered artifacts and skills but it's simply impossible for us to stand against those monstrosities.\"\nHearing Austin's remark, the old witch tilted her head like Austin seemed to have misunderstood something.\nAfter a short pause, the lady spoke again in an uncertain tone.\n\"I think you misinterpreted something. This system was never built to grant you strength.\"\nNow Austin was perplexed beyond belief as he glanced at Luna and found her equally confused.\nTurning toward the woman with his brows raised and evident bafflement aroused, Austin stayed silent and allowed the lady to explain.\nBut little did he think that the answer would be so startling to believe his own ear…\n\"The system is not inside you to make you powerful. It's just there to restrict what you actually possess but never was aware of..…\"\n_________________\nA/N: - Drop a comment if you are liking the story so far~",

      "content": "Austin always felt that there was something inside him that he never scratched off. Something inside him which was too frightening and audacious to discover.\nFirst, he thought that it was the original Austin's soul or something related to his lineage which was not shown in manga that's why he never pried in that space.\nWith time he got busy with worldly affairs ever since he started partaking in adventurer works at the age of eight—through special permission—and also this Villain's system didn't help either.\nThings happened and Austin never found the opportunity to think of that golden orb inside of him which even Luna was not able to discover even though she diagnosed him various times in the past.\nSince he never thought of that mystery as a relevant component, Austin did never mention it either.\nBut today, a woman—strange in distinct ways—made him aware once again that Austin has yet to unravel the secrets he possesses since his birth.\n\"W-What the heck is this…?\"\nCurrently, the witch had her left hand on Austin's chest after she called him near for a survey. Luna was reluctant to let the woman touch Austin but upon being pursued, Luna conceded.\nShe knew that the Witch had the might to obliterate each one of them in an instant. If Amanda wanted, she could've hurt Austin ever since he landed his feet on the floor. That was why Luna somehow convinced herself that this analysis that Amanda suggested was for Austin's good.\nSaya was equally worried but with Luna's one comforting look which told her that she(Luna) could handle it if things went south, the raven-haired beauty also settled down. But never left her brother's side just like Luna.\nAs for Austin, then he was currently in a realm where nothing made sense.\nAs soon as the Witch forced her peculiar energy inside of him, Austin's eyes glowed with a strange golden hue before Austin found himself floating in darkness with nothing beneath or above him.\nThere was only a single visible thing radiating in a bright golden shade, some meters away from him. It was pulsating and was covered with thin veins-like lining around it.\nAustin had an idea what it was since he had seen the gist of this thing a long time ago. But the problem was….why now. He was anxious to know how the system was responsible for limiting his strength when it was already far less when compared to Deities and Demons.\nBut it didn't make any sense when the Witch was making him see something he never found to flaunt, at the times when she should be explaining things.\n'Wait…why am I being so impatient… '\nThe self-realization hit hard since Austin was feeling uneasy ever since Amanda sent him to survey his own body.\nAnd the voice of the Witch made his doubt about his uneasiness clear.\n\"You are anxious since you have already guessed the reason for that thing's existence inside you. \"\nAustin was pulled back to reality as a gasp left his lips while his vision abruptly shifted to see the face of the Witch in front.\n\"Are you fine? Do you need water or anything?\" (Luna)\nLuna was transmitting a low-grade healing spell that would help lessen Austin's anxiety but nothing was working on him at the moment.\n\"Tell me what's that weird thing pulsating inside of me?\"\nAustin was no longer asking politely. It was the series of events weighing down his shoulders ever since he entered the labyrinth.\nAmanda understood the reason for such behavior and she didn't have any complaints about it. She was impressed that Austin hadn't lashed at her even though he came to know how he has been played by God's ploy in his either lives.\n\"You have read a lot of novels in your last life, right? You have seen how an omnipotent being always grants a reincarnating protagonist with blessings or wishes. Well, then the golden orb or your 'Mana core' is just a gift from the being who was responsible for your transmigration.\"\nNo words were spoken further as Austin leaned back on his chair and registered Amanda's words slowly and carefully.\nThe period of his death and rebirth was done in a flash and he never was met with any being which every isekai manga or novel portrays.\nAustin always thought that the memory of his past life was hefty enough to expect anything further.\nHe was in a fantasy world where he could grow exponentially if he worked hard. He never greed for more.\nBut after almost seventeen years of his rebirth, this woman has turned around a chapter of his book that Austin never was able to unfold.\n…no doubt why he was feeling troubled about this whole dive in the labyrinth.\nAmanda cleaned her glasses as she spoke further about the gift Austin possesses.\n\"Unlike others who borrow mana from their surroundings, you Austin, generate yours without the need for any external source. Even if the world's mana gets sucked right at this moment only you and I will be left alive in this room.\"\n\"Wait…why you?\"\nIt was Saya who almost spontaneously raised the question. It was rather troubling for her to hear that she wouldn't be with her brother but this old witch could.\n\"It's because I don't have a single drop of mana baby girl.\"\nSaya glared at the woman being called such but her focus was distributed on rather something else.\nIt indeed was troubling her and the other two as well, that Amanda had no mana presence at all. Even Luna was unable to track down the witch's identity of mana even though the latter used it quite a few times ever since they landed on this floor.\n\"Don't ask me how or why since we are focusing on Austin here, right?\"\nSaya instantly pursed her lips and restrained herself from asking anything further. Her brother held her first and foremost priority.\n\"You still didn't answer my first question.\"\nWith a small pause, Austin again asked the same thing he did after hearing the purpose of his system.\n\"Why was something built in the first place to restrict my powers? What is the true purpose of this system?\"\nAmanda gathered her focus on the blonde boy once again as she sighed and explained to him further.\n\"Every being has a limitation for how much they grow and those limitations are decided by the size of their mana vessels. The storage in which someone contains their mana temporarily and channels it according to their use. But you Austin… have no such limitation. You can grow your vessel with time and proper training and your mana core would discharge such energy to support your growth.\"\nAfter a slight pause, she continued.\n\"The restrictor I provided with the system is the true purpose of its existence.

      "content": "\"I am glad that you all returned safely.\"\nA genuine relieved smile was expressed by the first Prince as he saw the trio return from the Labyrinth.\nAfter Kyouki and Cordelia returned to the surface some days ago, the latter mentioned went to inform the ordeal to her superior after a proper rest.\nKyouki didn't stop her but just he altered her report and asked his childhood friend to keep some of the things hidden. Cordelia assured him since she now knew, what worth Austin carried and how much Gram requires such a being.\nNo. It goes for the whole of humanity.\nThe second prince was undoubtedly anxious just like his sister who didn't even leave the headmaster's office ever since that day when Austin left.\nThe white-bearded mage had to shift his working documents to his quarters since the first princess was not ready to budge at all.\nMikhail had come to his conclusion about Tiara's unexpected actions but he has chosen to gather more information and let her collect her feelings first.\n\"Thanks to you, I was able to gain a lot from there.\"\nBoth men let go of each other hands after a shake, as Austin spoke with a genuine smile, much to Mikhail's astonishment.\nThere wasn't anything mentioned in Cordelia's report of gaining artifacts or other treasure inside so whatever Austin was talking about either comes from the last floor or was something beyond such level?\nMikhail had his thoughts but he did his best to hide his curiosity for now since the three in front deserved a much-needed vacation.\n\"I will probably find you in the evening if your highness has time today.\"\nMikhail sucked on thin air by being offered such generously as he jumped to snatch the opportunity without hesitation.\n\"Then I will be waiting for your arrival, Master Austin.\"\nAustin nodded as they once again shook their hand before turning toward their person in concern.\nLuna and Saya were chatting with Tiara and Merlin who was the only one present alongside with Kyouki who was standing silently in a corner after his initial exchange with Austin.\nThe hero was glad that they made it back and that was enough for him to stay at his place, smiling merrily as he saw the others conversing.\n\"Umm…since my dear sister has got assurance of Sir Austin and his teammates' safety, I am assuming I will not be returning alone today?\"\nUpon hearing her brother's remark, Tiara flinched as her face turned crimson within a second. A complaining glare at the smiling bastard brother was the only thing she could do for now.\nAustin blinked in perplexion before Saya told him about the situation.\n\"Your highness has been staying in the office since that day of our departure. She was quite stressed…apparently more than she should be.\"\nSaya's suspicious gaze made Tiara even more embarrassed since the latter found herself being gawked at by the man she could not resist.\nAustin with his brows raised in surprise, approached Tiara before he spoke his genuine thoughts.\n\"I am touched, your highness. But it's not good as well for your to keep your family worried, isn't it?\"\nTiara lowered her head in shame but from inside even the sweet scolding of Austin was making her squirm in elation and excitement.\nLuna had her focus on the girl ever since and with such behavior, she became certain about a lot of things.\n'This guy…really… '\n\"T-Then I will be returning now, Sir Austin. But ca-can I ask for your a-a-appointment as well in the evening?\"\nAustin was not sure why the fidgety princess asked such a thing but he affirmed without putting much thought into it.\n\"Sure. I will be looking forward to it then.\"\n_._._._\nAfter greeting the headmaster and having last words for the night with Kyouki, everyone except for the person whose office they were acquiring, left the place.\nSaya was mentally and physically exhausted so Luna cast a low calming spell on her and tucked her in the blanket.\nIt was a very harmonious sight for Austin to see his lover and sister getting closer with time.\nSince Saya was staying at Luna's place, both of them retired back to their love nest around midnight.\n\"That princess has fallen over heels for you, master Austin.\"\nAs they walked inside Austin's room, Luna suddenly broke the news since she had an idea of how oblivion Austin could be to such matters.\nAnd indeed he had no clue.\n\"Really? I think rather she is more concerned for us since we are considered as so-called Gram's assets?\"\nLuna could only sigh in resignation on how ignorant he could be at times as she let loose of her overcoat and was left in a simple one-piece dress.\n\"I don't want to surveillance so please keep an eye on what she feeds you tomorrow. Or should I just bind you in chains and declare you no longer accessible to others?\"\nAustin laughed hearing such an absurd joke as he shook his head and replied in an amused tone.\n\"I will take care so stop overthinking.\"\nAustin also let go of his armor as he put the other stuff in his inventory before he saw Luna approaching the bathroom door.\nTurning just at the partition, she raised her brows and asked in a coquettish tone.\n\"Care to join?\"\nAs she said, her dress slid down slowly on the ground, exposing her pale white skin which gave her curvacious body even more tempting touch.\n*Gulp*\n\"Can't say no to that… \"\n_________________\nA/N: - The last line… did you get the ref?",

      "content": "\"Do you really not ever get tired? I am not complaining but still, I barely have seen you exhausting yourself.\"\nLying on the bed with no space to pass through between their naked bodies, Luna asked in a curious tone as she enjoyed the warmth pressing against her body.\nAfter their wild session which went on for quite a long time and were elevated from the bath to the tea table before the final round ended up on the bed.\nIt was Luna who in the end had to accept her defeat since she felt numb everywhere with such never lasting fierce attack from her not-so-gentle darling.\nShe admits that she likes it that way but the problem was her pride which has been shattering for some time whenever they engaged in a love-making session. She always concedes early.\n\"Having such a beautiful girl as my partner, it will take a lot more to make me tired.\"\nIn response to her innocent query, Austin just caressed her bare back as he spoke in a whispering tone.\nAnd in actuality, with time Austin's stamina has been improving which made him astonished as well. But now, he knows the reason behind his rigorous growth.\nThe night sky has been nearing dawn with the early canaries chirping merrily which echoed vividly in the room as the silence prevailed for a short period.\n\"Hey, Austin…\"\nWith her head still resting on his chest, Luna whispered his name with her gaze unfocused and mind in a slight turmoil which Austin was able to sense.\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"That witch….told you something which I am not aware of right?\"\nLuna still could clearly remember the Time Barrier in which Amanda shrouded herself and Austin in after the discussion of his system was over.\nIt was just for a tenth of a second but Luna saw something transpiring which she felt nothing less than distressing.\nShe was aware of how Time Barriers work but had yet to entirely master them. It goes without saying that Luna could not breach such a barrier with her current strength, more so when the castor was none other than the oldest Witch in existence.\nShe knew that Amanda conveyed something to Austin that the latter didn't tell her or Saya about. And that was enough to make Luna feel anxious and nervous.\nBut as she primarily thought…\n\"There was nothing like that, Luna. I got to know everything which you and Saya also heard.\"\nShe knew Austin for the first time lying to her and she didn't like it. It was clear from the way his body stiffened even for a second or how he took his time to respond.\nShe knew that his eyes would also betray his words if she tilts her head in his direction and asked him to confess the truth.\nShe had ways to pry into his mind but Luna was not going to use them.\nShe respects Austin's decision and knows that it should be something Luna shouldn't be aware of, that's why Austin was left with no choice rather than to hide the truth.\n\"Hey, Luna… \"\nIntertwining his fingers with hers Austin slowly raised their hand which gave Luna a spot to keep her eyes on, as she heard him continuing.\n\"Do you believe in me?\"\n\"More than anyone. You are the only person I can blindly put all my trust in.\"\nHer answer came right after which contained not a single ounce of hesitation. And Luna meant what she conceded. Austin felt it and did not doubt her words.\nBoth of them knew why Austin was asking such a question but they had their distinct reasons to not talk about it.\nAustin silently gawked at their hand or to be precise Luna's well-sculpted fingers which were unblemished and porcelain as ever.\nBut something was missing…\n\"I was thinking…why don't we get married?\"\n___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___\nOn an open grass field, the slow breeze of early morning was making it almost impossible for a normal being to stand straight without shivering and seeking out for shelter.\nYet in such condition, a raven-haired youth was swinging his great sword without an ounce of discomfort or fatigue even though he was practically bathed in sweat.\nWith his torso wrapped in bandages and loose pants on his lower body, Kyouki practiced his sword skills while using the technique that old Hachi taught him.\nHis growth was evident but not enough since his mana reserve was stanant as ever and it was making Kyouki agitated.\nHis powerlessness was yet again proven in the Labyrinth and Kyouki hasn't been able to rest ever since. He just… couldn't forget how cowardly he just stood in a corner while relaying all the burden over Austin.\nHe no longer has dreams of acquiring Luna's heart since he knew he doesn't deserve her by a long shot. But this feeling of rivalry with Austin doesn't fades.\nKyouki no longer loathes Austin but himself since it was Kyouki's own powerlessness that he always made it seem that Austin was evil and he was on the side of justice.\nKyouki was delusional and that blindness left him hanging at his spot while everyone leaped forward, for a better future.\nLuna was already out of comprehensibility. Vanessa also left to attain something in her life. Even Sicily and Lilia had gotten proficient in their skills and had actively worked on their weakness in Kyouki's absence.\nHe just… can't tolerate his own existence.\n\"Stop that, Kyouki.\"\nA stern voice pulled Kyouki out of his reverie as he found himself frozen at his spot for who knows how long.\nTurning himself to the source of the voice, he found Sicily standing there with her gaze narrowed and annoyance written all over ger face.\n\"Sicily… Ah!\"\nWithout warning the girl walked forward before she wrapped her hand around him while she felt her cheeks heating just upon feeling his bare body.\nKyouki was startled since he never found Sicily so assertive before. But he didn't dislike the feeling, so wordlessly he let go of his sword and also wrapped his hand around her thin frame.\n\"Stop abusing yourself, Kyouki. It hurts to see you like this… You have no idea how your thoughts and actions influence me and Lilia.\"\nKyouki sighed inaudibly since he knew how caring his teammates were toward him. It made him gratified and slightly burdened as well.\nHe liked this feeling to be cared for by someone but it makes him feel miserable whenever he fails to respond to their expectancy or the emotions they carry.\nSicily felt that Kyouki was still troubled about his progress so she suggested the plan that her father preferred some days ago.\n\"You are worried because of your slow growth, right?\"\nAfter separating herself Sicily wiped the moisture off her eyes as she saw Kyouki nodding with a dumb look on his face.\nIt was quite an adorable sight.\nCollecting herself she held his hand as she spoke in a determined tone.\n\"Then let's go. It will be either us dying out there or coming out stronger than ever. It might be risky but I am certain that you will never feel the same way you are right now.\"\n___ ____ ___ ____ ___\nA/N: - Characters would scatter and new ones would be introduced.

      "content": "It was nearly five in the evening when with a serene smile, Austin approached the office of the second Prince in the central palace.\nThe guards were informed to not stop Austin from entering inside any time of the day. Except for the inspection near the entrance gate to verify whether it is Austin or not, there was no other disturbance in between his walk to Mikhail's cabin.\n\"Oh, hey!\"\n\"Uhh...Austin...\"\nIt was Cordelia who bumped into him as she was walking out of Mikhail's office, with some paper in hand.\nCordelia was evidently startled to meet Austin all of a sudden but since she got the chance, there was no way Cordelia was going to miss it.\n\"For whatever you have done for me and Kyouki is more than I could compensate with my life with. I am truly grateful, Austin.\"\nNow Austin was taken aback by being bowed in such a sincere manner and also the heartfelt gratitude was no helping either. It was the opposite of how he was being treated by her the first time they met in the palace.\nBeing a yandere character Cordelia bowing to someone who has tormented Kyouki in past was indeed surprising. But he has forgotten the past and has long grown uncaring toward what he read in his previous life.\n\"I accept your gratitude, so please raise your head.\"\nCordelia half reluctantly strengthened her back as it felt that she didn't express properly how thankful she was. But it would be too embarrassing to list those things here.\nWith an apologetic smile adorning her unblemished innocent face, Cordelia spoke in a regretful tone.\n\"I really wanted to have a chat with you and properly apologize for my behavior from back then but you see I am going somewhere.\"\nAs she said, Cordelia lifted the papers in her hand making Austin perplexed as he gestured in questioning.\n\"I am taking leave from my job and joining Kyouki's journey for some months.\"\nAustin was surprised that Kyouki was going on a journey all of a sudden. But then again, that guy must have been feeling quite miserable. It was just like Kyouki.\nAnd Austin understood his urge to get powerful as soon as possible.\nAustin himself after learning about his origin and his true potential has been itching to dive into dungeons and fight until exhausted.\nCollecting his thoughts, he smiled at the raven-haired girl as he spoke in a contented tone.\n\"Be safe out there.\"\nCordelia was taken aback by that ridiculously charming smile that only a noble like Austin could be capable of. But soon she gathered her thoughts as well and responded in a similar tone.\n\"Mmm. We will.\"\n_._.\n**Kncok*Knock**\n**Click**\nJust upon tapping on the door, it was parted from the inside before a beautiful woman in her twenties appeared from the other side.\n\"Greetings, Sir Austin.\"\n\"Evening Jeanne.\"\nWith a mutual nod, both of them finished their greetings before the secretary guided Austin inside the office where as usual emerged piles of papers and dusted old files.\nThe room was filled with the smell of caffeine but Austin's liking for coffee and the heaviness of the atmosphere was something that doesn't makes him bothered.\nSuddenly he found himself needing to take a lit while sipping on hard coffee.\n'Maybe later....'\nMikhail was standing at his place with a grin lifting the edge of his lips as the prince greeted his guest in an enthusiastic tone.\n\"Good evening, Austin. I hope you had a great night's rest.\"\nAustin felt like sighing since he never actually slept after walking out of the labyrinth thanks to his soon-to-be bride's excitement which soared higher than he ever saw after he asked her hand for marriage.\nBut Austin can't complain either since it was he who took the lead whenever Luna laid down on his chest, all spent while panting heavily.\n'Get yourself together you horndog! '\nReprimanding himself Austin greeted back as they shook hands and sat down facing each other with Jeanne as usual standing some feet to the left of Mikhail.\nThe two men then engaged in casual conversation which mainly circulated around the Labyrinth and Austin's experience.\nApart from what happened on the fifth and tenth floors, Austin told most things truthfully since there was nothing to hide.\nSoon a maid delivered the trolley of tea and snacks which Jeanne took a hold of at the door and proceeded to serve the two without missing a single word that left Austin's lips.\n\"So there's a chance where we might fight without the support of mana...\"\nA knitted frown was currently adored on Mikhail's forehead as he heard Austin's words.\nAccording to Austin, there might arise chances where the artifact that the Witch created for the demons might emerge once again on the battlefield.\nLuna did kill that Witch who was hiding in the jungle but that doesn't imply there couldn't be any more ancient creatures hidden from bare perception.\nNot to talk about Dwarves which now don't seem to be a part of a mere fairytale. If Witches could be alive then so be the Dwarves or maybe creatures like Leviathan.\nThe situation was growing severe and Mikhail has no issues in accepting that humanity is more or less the same as it was since the first Great war except for some advanced artifacts and weaponry.\n\"There's an option, Your highness. There's a way to fight while being mana disarmed. And no, I am not talking about a physical brawl.\"\nMikhail perked his ear and refocused his eyes on Austin. The impatience and anxiety were written over his face and one could easily guess the reason behind it.\nEven Jeanne was quite taken aback after hearing so many details and exposure to unheard reality.\nPutting the cup back on the saucer, Austin picked a chocolate chip cookie as he quelled their curiosity.\n\"Mana Craft.\"\nFor a second Mikhail thought he heard it wrong since what Austin said was nothing more than humanity's dream ever since they discovered mana core.\nHowever, it's a dream implying it hasn't been achieved yet but the enemy was ready out there.\nBut Austin's following action made the prince way beyond flabbergasted.\n\"Check this.\"\nAustin knew that the man in front won't believe it until he doesn't see the proof so he(Austin) took out a dagger from his inventory and put it on the table.\nJeanne got alerted instantly but Mikhail raised his hand in denial before he put his undivided attention on the peculiar short weapon.\n\"T-this....\"\nMikhail was left short on words as he touched the weapon and felt raw active mana radiating from the small ruby embedded at the bottom of its handle and carved in a way to assist in grip.\nUnlike how one imbues their mana in their weapon to bring a better version out of it, this short dagger was emitting its own mana energy like it was a living thing.\n\"If another Mana restrictor goes off in this room, this weapon would work fine for at least seven hours since that mana core belongs to a Terror rank demon. As higher the level goes the longer magical energy a weapon would sustain.\"\nMikhail felt the weight of the dagger suddenly increasing after he heard of what mana core was fixated on the dagger.\nBut he held his inner warrior who was itching to try this dagger right at this moment and thought more about his people's development.\nWiping away his awe, Mikhail looked at Austin with a severe expression as he asked in a sincere tone.\n\"Sir Austin. How much it would require to buy this and any other mana-crafted weapon you have.\"\nAustin leaned back on the chair with a sigh leaking out his lips, since he knew this question would arrive.\nMunching on the cookie and finishing it with the last sip of the tea, he spoke in a nonchalant tone, much to the other two's shock.\n\"It's priceless and I won't be giving anything from my arsenal.\"\n___________________...\nA/N: - Any reader out there who thinks this story should turn into a harem with selected members?\nLet me know in the comments~",

      "content": "A long pause spread in the first Prince’s office as the words left Austin’s lips’ so nonchalant.\nNeither Jeanne nor her lord was able to comprehend what they heard but by whichever means they thought, it was inevitable that Austin just now bluntly rejected the request to sell his weapons and completely pull away from the upcoming crisis.\n“Can I ask the reason?”\nWith a severe frown, Mikhail asked in a heavy tone since it was a matter of national security.\nIt was true that Austin was not liable nor bound with Gram but still being a citizen of the empire and also considering their ‘smooth’ relationship which has been continuing until now, Mikhail expected at least an answer of such an upfront rejection.\nAustin saw the assistant walking forward to refill the cup which brought a smile on his face as he liked the taste of the beverage along with the cookies. But that doesn’t means he would change his answer.\n“Two reasons, actually.”\nWith a brief pause and after thanking Jeanne with a small bow, Austin took the cup as he continued, “ First, I don’t want to. Second, you don’t need it.”\nMikhail felt his veins popping somewhere on his forehead but remembering who was sitting across him, the blonde prince held himself together and with a forced smile asked.\n“ I can understand the first reason, but can I ask why we don’t require such support which practically could help us from possible annihilation.”\nAustin knew the prince was frustrated since he had thousands of people to worry about. He really would be a responsible leader in the future.\nTwirling the cookie on his fingers, Austin burst their impatience but a cloud of bewilderment soon followed.\n“I can teach the blacksmiths some basics of mana craft and after that, it will be their hard work. Your people would get employment and the empire would strengthen altogether. Win-win, I guess?”\nMikhail leaned back on his chair in utter astonishment as he heard Austin's confident remark which seemed nothing short of bullshit. Well, Mikhail was having his doubts but remembering the miracles Austin have shown until now, he halted his thoughts.\nNot only does Austin have mana-crafted weapons but he also knows how to make it as well?\n‘Is it really true…’\nWell, it was certain that the weapons Austin carries are no regular shop purchases but some refined work of a godly professional smith. And to Mikhail’s knowledge, there hadn’t been any craftsman able to achieve such feat till date. Then there was a possibility as well that Austin might have been making all his weapons all by himself until now?\nIt certainly might be the case and since Mikhail didn’t have any other plan in mind, there was nothing he could do other than nod his head.\n“Then once again I will be relying on you.”\nAustin enjoyed the last sip of the tea as he thought to wrap up the meeting and see the princess before returning to his dorm.\nBut then he realized the primary motive for which he came here.\n“Umm…yeah, can I ask a favor of Your highness?”\nMikhail beamed with a surprised smile since favoring Austin was one of the things he could never decline.\n“Please tell me, Sir Austin.”\nAustin saw through the intentions of such elated curiosity even though Austin was going to ask for something. The sly prince just wants to raise more and more opportunities to burden Austin with favors.\nWith his eyes still narrowed, Austin confessed his request.\n“It's about Cathedral. You see I ….\n(Scene Break)\n“How nice~ Of course, I would help. Rest assured I would personally take care of everything.”\nAustin had a bad feeling about this but apart from the central authority he had only coercive methods in mind.\nSeeing even the stoic secretary smiling as well, made Austin embarrassed as he soon took his leave.\n—----------------------------------------\nAfter some more minutes, Austin walked out of the office having everything said and promised.\nThe next place he was guided to by one of the maids who was waiting just at the office door, was a beautiful garden.\nThere were small flower beds arranged and gardened neatly to give a peaceful vibe and attract attention.\nThe drowning sun at the horizon was flashing brightly as Austin located the only person visible in the garden, currently seated near a tea table.\nThere was something that made Austin hesitate before approaching the first princess Tiara and that was the things that Luna told him about yesterday.\nHe wasn’t bothered about it since he never thought about the girl in any other way but just inviting her to his wedding would now seem utterly disrespectful.\nAustin decided to refrain from doing so as he finally began to walk forward.\nThe flowers indeed smelt nice as he walked on the pavement made in between them while enjoying the scene.\nBut as soon he stood beside Tiara, his movement froze as his breath.\nShe was…crying…no, wailing actually….\n“W-what happened your highness?”\nAustin instinctively knelt beside her as he asked without minding the manners. She seemed just like Saya for a second there which aroused his brotherly instincts.\nTurning her head slowly in his direction Tiara took a hold of his hand as she sobbed her words out somehow,\n“You….you…c*sniff*can’t do this to me..….”\n----------------------\nA/N: Next chapter would be long.\nI have decided to tear this story into two parts since I don't want to rush things. The first part would conclude at their wedding so brace yourself.\nDrop a comment if you are hyped~",

      "content": "Austin in his either lives has been mostly clueless about a single subject and that is women’s emotions and their approach toward him.\nIn his last life, he had some physical relationships but just that. He never understood how those women think of him or whether someone can actually love him for what he was or is.\nEven in this life, he had various figures of the opposite gender around him, but most of them either hated him or simply avoided him. Except for his first and only personal maid who was the only woman who genuinely cared for him before he met Luna.\nLater when he came to know about Luna’s feelings he was over cloud nine since such an amazing and beautiful woman was romantically interested in him, albeit the reason behind it was a little different.\nBut still, despite spending a decent amount of time with Luna, he finds it difficult to consider a woman’s feelings through their behavior around him. Maybe because Luna is different from others but he never actually cared.\nNot so long before, it was Luna and Saya who told Austin that he was actually quite popular in the school and how many confession letters they have shredded, which baffled Austin.\nThey told him the reason why all the guys look scornfully at him despite him not behaving like a jerk anymore. And why there were so many girls visiting the church to pray these days when Austin was in the labyrinth. He was unaware of all of this.\nSimilarly, when Luna told Austin that the first princess is in love with him, he did not entirely believe in her. Apart from different social standings, Tiara never actually said anything to Austin which could have made Luna’s remark, believable.\nBut looking at the woman in front and the things she confessed started to make sense about those things which Austin took casually.\nTiara’s favoring him in the headmaster’s office and helping him get the approval of the upper echelons to enter the labyrinth was something Austin thought was the result of Tiara’s innocence or maybe she wants to weigh him down with favors, just like her brother? But he was mistaken.\nAbout a lot of things...\n“So Princess Tiara is in love with me for a long time and never was able to confess just because she was shy?”\nAustin summarized the long thirty minutes confession of the girl who told him about things he never has believed if she hadn’t have given him the proof. It was tough for her to say so many things but Austin constantly tried to calm her down and patiently each and every word of hers before he drew out such a conclusion.\nShe has been once saved by him during his adventuring days but Austin never got to know her identity since he left the scene soon after.\nThe precise description she gave of his adventurer uniform and also the exact time she told him about such an incident aligned with the memory of his when Austin saved a royal carriage.\nAnd since the first princess’ studied in another continent due to safety measures at that time she never got to see her savior again until her sixteenth birthday when she returned to Gram. However, it was already late...\nShe kept an eye on him and tried to help him from the shadows but due to her lack of authority and the consecutive wars in the nation made it nearly impossible for Tiara to do anything in order to help him or save him from various circumstances. She particularly hated herself for not being influential enough to stop that curse investigation on Austin.\nDespite understanding her situation Austin couldn’t help but feel that the girl was somewhat not speaking the whole truth. But he didn’t want to pry in those matters since Tiara haven’t done any damage to him or his loved ones. She was just...helplessly falling in love.\nHolding her hand fondly which the girl required in order to stop her from bawling, he spoke in a soft tone.\n“I understand your feeling Tiara, but we both know I cannot reciprocate them.”\nTiara’s breath choked with her long sob as her eyes started damping once again, but this was something Austin had to say clearly and firmly, in order to save her from any further misunderstanding.\n“I love my Luna more than anyone or anything and having more than one relationship would hurt her. And by no means, I could afford that, so please try to understand my feelings.”\nAustin never actually thought of having multiple women because of two reasons. First, he would feel like betraying Luna. Second, he doesn’t want to divide his attention from her.\nTiara despite already anticipating his answer still felt thousands of needles piercing her heart and dripping her life out. She felt like dying at that moment when she was forced to face the reality.\nA reality where Austin doesn’t see her as anything more than an acquaintance. A life where she could not be with him.\nThat’s it. He doesn’t love her. He couldn’t be with her. He has to go, far...far from her. And there was nothing she could do other than mourn and cry.\n“If... you can’t be with me...”\nAustin got startled as the long silent Tiara suddenly began to talk albeit it was more like she was gasping to utter those words.\nBut what caught his attention was the thing suddenly appeared before he heard her continuing...or more like concluding.\n“....then at least... let me die by your side...”\n“TIARA NO!!”\n----------------------------------------\nA/N: A little bit of drama is required before I conclude the first part of the story.\nI hope you guys liked the chapter.

      "content": "In the Eden Academy, it was a distressful day as every professor along with the headmaster himself was gathered at a place and was anxiously standing along with some major figures of the empire.\nAmong those were the first prince, Duke Reynold, and Alex who came to guard a single entity.\nThe Emperor of Gram.\nAfter they heard from Tiara’s maid that the first princess has stabbed herself and Austin had taken her away, Alex tracked down where the blond boy went and informed his majesty.\nIt was a matter of life and death which undoubtedly would panic any father, especially when he already has lost his eldest son.\nAlong with a troupe of soldiers, they all rushed to the Academy through the portal, and from what Alex sensed, Austin has taken Tiara to his dorm, where all these people have gathered.\nThe reason they weren’t able to walk in was because of a single woman standing as a guard who has forbidden anyone from trespassing.\nEmperor William through authority or by force tried to dismiss Saya but he failed when all his guard was lost just under her aura. She was frightening through and through, about whom even Alex conceded.\nThere was no hero Kyouki or Commander Charles around as well who could force with brutal strength and Merlin was also helpless since commencing some high-degree spell might damage Tiara who was inside.\nDuke Reynold was helplessly sighing as well since his best shot was his daughter who might have pursued the matter but some days ago he received her letter that she was going somewhere for some days.\nHe indeed was worried for her but he knew Sicily was a sensible girl who wouldn’t do anything rashly. But the matter of fact remains in this anomaly currently standing in front of Austin’s dorm.\nThere were reports about a strange professor in the Academy who regards Austin as her brother but neither Reynold nor any other high official paid much mind to it before.\n‘\nBut now, the Duke regretted such a decision.\nMikhail was the most nervous after his father since despite knowing Tiara’s obsession with Austin didn’t inform the latter. If Austin would have known what madness she possess then Austin might have taken things with Tiara more cautiously.\nBut all he can do now was to wait…\nAfter what seemed an eternity for some, which in reality was just half an hour, Saya jerked slightly before she stepped forward and announced in a loud tone.\n“Any five of you may go inside.”\nEmperor William didn’t even think a second before he marched forward, without caring whether he was guarded or even anyone was following him. He just wanted to see his daughter.\nMikhail nodded toward Reynold, Alex, and Merlin before they also walked inside wordlessly.\nSaya closed the door after the last man walked in before she stood straight once again, facing the crowd sternly.\n------------------------\nIn the room, there were three people present. Other than Tiara and Austin, Luna was also there who was sitting on a chair with her face pale in exhaustion.\nAs the others walked in, Austin turned to them and bowed to the Emperor as the man only responded with a small nod before he moved to the bed where his precious daughter was lying with her nape wrapped in a thick band-aid and a strange mana circle revolving actively around the region.\nTiara’s face had tear stains and the redness of her face was entirely evaporated like she was just on verge of dying.\nWilliam’s heart clenched but he was able to hold himself together as while roaming his hand over Tiara’s cold forehead he asked in a hushed tone.\n“How is she? Will you be able to save her, Luna-san?”\nThe saintess recognized by the pope of the cathedral undoubtedly would be the best doctor William could ask for so Luna’s following words were critical for the Emperor.\nLuna calmed herself; as she took a heavy breath before getting up from her seat. The others gave her space as she walked up to the man.\n“She has injected with an Enzaer which I have only come across once. I am trying my best to cure it but I need time. However…whether she would be able to hold that long highly depends on her willingness and from what I could sense, Your Highness is doing her best to oppose my cure.”\nAlex widened his eyes since he recognized the name of the poison Luna spoke of but never found one even though he tried all his resources. However, he was not going to quell his curiosity at the moment.\nWilliam didn’t have to ask further since he already grasped the fatality of the matter. He was left speechless for a long time as he thought of any possible resort of how he could save his princess but he was able to think of none.\n“Why…why isn’t she willing to live anymore?”\nHearing the mournful voice, Luna turned to look at Austin since she didn’t know whether she should be saying this. Thankfully, someone else walked forward to take care of the situation.\n“Father…let’s talk about it later. First, we have to save Tia.”\nMikhail squeezed his father's shoulder as he spoke in a whispering tone. His guilt and remorse intensified ever since he entered the room, but he have to keep himself collected.\nLuna stepped back as she stood beside Austin before the latter wrapped his hand around her shoulder while various thoughts resurfaced in his mind. He actively was thinking about whether any of his artifacts could help her.\nBut he could not think of any and he was feeling miserable about it. After all, even though no one blames him, it was no denying that Tiara ended up like this because Austin was late to react.\nThe room fell into dead silence with the only thing audibly echoing was the ragged breath of the princess.\nSuddenly, Luna’s eyes widened as she suddenly felt something but before she could have affirmed whether she sensed it right, a joyful voice abruptly barged in.\n“I heard there was a wedding?”\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nA/N:- Guess who?\nDrop a comment if you are liking the story so far~",

      "content": "“I heard there was a wedding~”\nEvery gaze turned toward the beautiful woman who suddenly entered the room despite the tight security at the entrance.\nThe woman, by appearance, seemed a middle-aged lady but her beauty and confident aura adorned with the tempting charm which made it nearly impossible for anyone to tear their eyes off made her presence prominent in the room.\nHowever, more than anything that made everyone except Luna, widen their eyes was the dense yet purest form of mana they felt from the lady which made the air slightly suffocating yet pleasant to breathe at the same time.\nThe natural admiration for the lady was making it seem natural for the others to kneel and worship the lady, but thankfully Luna’s loud call helped them get out of their daze.\n“Grandma!”\nLuna walked forward, after elbowing Austin who staring at the lady, as she hug the woman fondly and found the latter reciprocating the gesture by chuckling heartily as she patted Luna’s back.\nAustin instantly regretted and questioned his morals be eyeing like that to Luna’s grandma. He hesitantly thought about whether he should walk forward to introduce himself but found himself nervous like never before.\nFor Luna, her grandma was the dearest person she had apart from Austin so the blond-haired boy was anxious about how he should be approaching the matter.\nThankfully, the older woman seemed not-so-strict as she smiled at Austin knowingly before she separated from her granddaughter.\n“I, William der Gramdour, pay respect to the Lady Supreme.”\nMikhail had no idea why his father suddenly knelt on the ground but when he and the other two heard how their majesty referred the woman, they also fell on their knee and head leaned forward.\nThere was only no doubt in the fact that the entity in front who was extruding such dense mana was one of the guardian deities in her human form.\n“You recognized me?”\n“I did not receive the blessing, Lady Supreme, but I do have the experience to identify our guardians.”\nWilliam despite having an emotional breakdown some moments ago, displayed a sight of pure admiration toward the being he could have never expected in this situation.\nDuke Reynold had his mind short-circuited like the bespectacled mage beside him since it was the first time they had come in the air of a deity. Expect being too overwhelmed they could do nothing rather than let their majesty take the lead.\nCeleria, paused before the blond youth with a faint smile on her face as she surveyed him up to down. Austin could only glance at Luna in stress but the latter was just smirking since it was rare for her to see Austin so bloated with anxiety.\n“We shall have a nice chat over a cup of tea?”\nAustin didn’t let his gaze fixate her as he soon nodded and replied in a firm tone.\n“Yes, of course. “\nCeleria contended with Austin’s physical and internal condition from what she surveyed so these shortcomings he showed were already forgiven.\n“We have a rather pressing matter in hand to take care of.”\nWilliam was washed with a sense of relief as the lady advanced toward Tiara with a small frown on her face. Luna soon followed.\nCeleria traced her hand over Tiara’s whole body with a faint cyan hue radiating over her hand. The frown knitted further as it seemed she finally grasped what Luna told them earlier.\n“Enzaer huh….I am impressed how you have restrained its growth, dear.”\nCeleria smiled at her granddaughter which further making the girl smile in delight but that smile soon died down as she asked in a heavy tone.\n“But Grandma…”\n“Yeah, I know.”\nRefocusing her gaze on the young girl lying lifeless on the bed, the older woman continued.\n“Her mana is restlessly trying to accept the poison which in turn makes it nearly impossible for any cure to reach before the poison erodes her vessel and turns her into a corpse.”\nWilliam's heart clenched to a further extent as he heard a such a thing from Celeria who was the last hope left. Being at such a divine level, William knew Tiara wouldn’t survive if even Celeria declare her as a lost cause.\n“Father….”\nMikhail supported his father as they silently waited for the guardian deity to continue.\nCeleria turned her head in Austin’s direction as she spoke in a firm tone unlike before.\n“Austin…”\nHe stepped forward, still slightly tensed as he wordlessly nodded for her to continue.\n“I will connect you to this girl’s subconscious. You have to do your best to convince her that it’s not the end for her. Her reluctance for life derives from you so I guess you won’t mind taking some responsibility, right?”\nThe room fell dead silent since those who didn’t know why and how Tiara committed suicide or why she was not ready to continue her life anymore, got a gist of what might have happened. Well, they already had an idea but hearing the lady’s words, they got the clarity.\nOn the other hand, Luna had a frown adorning her face as she spoke in a complaining tone.\n“But Grandma-“\n“I know my child, but if Austin’s lies could help someone’s life then I don’t find any issue worth not trying~”\nThe fact of the matter was, Celeria wanted Austin to enter Tiara’s subconscious and on basis of some lies and sugar-coated words, convince the princess so she doesn’t actively try to end herself.\nAnd in the meantime, the lady could heal the patient back to safety.\nAustin didn’t have to think much since even Luna would have stopped him, Tiara’s condition was something he calls himself responsible for.\nWith a serene look on his face, he nodded toward the lady.\n“I’ll do it.”\n------------------------------------------------------------\nA/N:- We are nearing the end of the first half.

      "content": "Heavy silence prevailed in the room where several figures could be seen wearing different expressions.\nMikhail, his father, and Duke Reynolds were standing together with a trace of anxiety and a frown continuously knitted on their brows as they stared at a mutual side.\nIn a corner, Alex was conversing in a very low tone with the headmaster of the academy only after, he cast a barrier around them to not disturb the operation in the process.\nLuna with a solemn expression was standing beside her beloved without touching him as per grandmother’s instructor who currently was kneeling beside the first princess.\nWith a beautiful cyan hue covering her whole self, the guardian deity was currently channeling a specific kind of spell with her one hand connected with Austin and another with Tiara as she sent him into her subconscious to convince the dying princess. Simultaneously the older woman was healing the patient as well, since despite slowly she could sense the willingness of Tiara returning.\nAustin was succeeding in his task.\nLuna had a slight frown on her brows since she knew whatever sweet lies Austin was going to tell the princess, Luna wouldn’t like them.\nNot talking about Tiara’s disappointment to know that Austin wouldn’t be fulfilling any of his promises once she regain consciousness would be devastating for her for sure.\nBut this has to be done since her grandma was sensitive to strong emotions and from what she told, Tiara holds genuine and quite heavy feelings for Austin. Despite not admitting it, Luna was slightly happy that someone identified how much her man was worthy of, but not like she would allow anything to happen between them even if the princess returned back alive.\nSaya was already quite a lot Luna could share his love for. No one other than that was allowed near him!\n“It’s happening.”\nWith a charming smile on her face and her eyes still closed, Celeria announced which washed the room with relief as Mikhail exhaled audibly like he was bursting out his stress.\nWilliam had similar sentiments but the line of work has made him least reactive even in times like these, but that doesn’t mean he didn’t care about his children.\nFor more than ten minutes, the hue kept on channeling both ways as the audience kept their mouth shut and waited for the older lady to finish up first.\nFinally, after what seemed like an eternity for some, Tiara’s eyes fluttered groggily before she steadily lifted her lids only to be greeted by the man she was expecting the most.\nStood in her vision was the man who was the cause of her potential death and now was her savior as well.\nWith her gaze fixated on Austin, Tiara in an almost inaudible tone asked, “…you meant it, right?”\nAnother wave of tension flashed on the emperor’s face as he more or less understood the situation. The thought of Austin telling her that it was just a lie was making William’s heart clench.\nBut against his and others’ expectation…\n“I will comply with my promise, princess. Now focus on your treatment.”\nLike the first flower of spring, a smile bloomed on Tiara’s face as with her eyes curved she nodded.\n“Mm.”\nSoon William and Mikhail approached the girl as Celeria gave them space while negating the last drop of poison from Tiara’s system.\nAustin backed away and exchanged some words with the other three, mainly about Hero’s party and future prospectus.\nAs per what Merlin said, Kyouki left the school some days ago with Lilia, Sicily, and Cordelia with him for an uncertain period. Austin has an idea of what must be going through the hero’s mind so he didn’t pry into the matter.\nDespite being now weaker than he should be according to the actual plot, because of Austin’s intervention, Kyouki was destined to shine in the near future. And the way things are going to turn, Austin needs strong people he could trust.\nAfter excusing themselves, Austin and Luna left the building for some fresh air since the treatment was going to take some time.\n“Onii-sama?”\n“Everything is fine, now. But don’t crowd the dorm since it might not go well for the patient.”\nAustin announced to the crowd of soldiers and professors as they sighed in relief and nodded in understanding upon hearing the latter part of the statement.\nTurning his head toward his little sister, Austin gently patted the girl as he spoke in a calm tone.\n“You did well, Saya.”\nIn response, Saya only kept her head down but the redness her ears adapted didn’t go unnoticed by Luna or the shocked surroundings as they saw the previously stern woman acting all shy and adorable in front of the boy.\nThere indeed was something fishy…\n“Should we grab something in the meantime?”\nOn Austin’s proposal, Saya nodded without much thought, similar to Luna who was silent ever since Austin has returned from Tiara’s subconscious.\nAustin knew she had to ask something so he took them to sit somewhere before he could talk things out.\nThe canteen was open for the students until ten, so they had no problem choosing the location to grab some light while they chat.\nAs usual, Austin brought some cakes and tea for the ladies as they sat on the dining table by the entrance where no one was present. Well, the canteen more or less was empty.\nWhen Austin returned to his seat with trays in his hand he saw that not only Luna but Saya also had some serious questioning look in her eyes, signifying that the saintess has spilled the beans.\nWell, not like he was going to hide such a fact from his sister.\nSighing he plopped down on his seat and served something sweet to both as he voiced his concern first.\n“…regardless of what I promised to the princess, I want you to know Luna that you are the only woman whom I could come to love ever in my life. Remember that.”\nSaya’s heart clenched but she didn’t let it show on her face. She might be disheartened after hearing that her brother couldn’t love anyone else, but the promise mattered more at the moment.\nSimilarly, Luna also was tense. More so upon hearing his words which told her that something undesirable would be following.\nBut even so, she has decided to hear it whatever it was.\nNodding she urged him to continue.\nAustin took a deep inhale, making the two in front even more nervous as he finally decided to tell them what caused Tiara to agree with him.\n“Actually….”\n----------------------------------------------------------\nA/N: - Maybe five or six chapters are remaining.

      "content": "“So she asked you to be hers for a day once a year…”\nInside the Academy cafeteria sat a group of two beautiful ladies with a grim expression on their faces. In front of them rested a blond-youth with his hand scratching his head as he didn’t think his words would be this impactful.\n“Don’t phrase like I will be belonging to her. Tia-..I mean the princess just asked to spend a whole day with her once every year and that would be enough for her. And since I didn’t find any problem in promising such small request…”\nSeeing the narrowed gaze of both his lover and sister, Austin closed his mouth before he could have blurted anything wrong. Or he already has gone over the board?\nThere was a long silence spread in between the three as the chattering from the background became prominent.\nSaya had complicated look on her face and her entire being wanted to protest against such a decision her brother took without putting much thought behind it. But she knew it wasn’t her place to object his decision.\nAs for Luna…\n“What if I don’t like it, Austin? What if I want you to not to meet her ever again?\"\nLuna had her face leaned slightly with her fingers tracing the ede of her cup as she asked in a heavy tone.\nAustin upon hearing Luna’s words didn’t have think even for a minute before he responded with a voice which was void of any hesitation.\n“Then I will go back on my words and not see the princess even once from this point on. If there is something which you don’t like Luna, I will not try to force with it in names of my circumstances or anything like that.”\nLuna heard what she expected as she clenched her fist under the table. It was not that she was frustrated or angry. It was more like she was overwhelmed by how love he pours in their relationship.\nShestayed silent for some moments which made Austin naturally tensed but soon an audible sigh leaked her lips as she leaned back on her seat and looked at her man with a tired expression.\n“I sometime want to lock you up to hide you from others…”\nThough she muttered Saya was able to hear such tremendous idea which she herself has thought in the past. And if it’s Luna then Saya would be granted to be with them as well, so she has no problem with such arrangements.\n“Did you say something, Luna?”\n“N-No nothing. I just want you to know that whenever you meet that princess, you are strictly not allowed to breach a thirty-meter distance between you two. Got it?”\nAustin blinked perplexedly as he heard the requirement which told that Luna had no problem with his promise.\nSince he was himself was a loyal partner he was not going to get intimate with Tiara in the first place so he readily agreed with Luna’s condition.\n“Sure.”\n----------------------------------------------------\nIt was around seven in the evening when Luna’s grandma was done with her treatment as she retired off the dorm along with the other nobilities. The emperor did try to invite the Guardian deity to the palace, but she politely rejected since she wanted to spend this brief time with her granddaughter and son-in-law.\nSaya chuckled at the sight of her nervous brother who knew Luna’s grandma would be having a chat with him as he continuously kept on asking Luna about how he can impress her grandma so she doesn’t break off the marriage.\nAnd Luna being Luna, kept her lips pursed despite him pestering as she left all the responsibility of the matter on Austin.\nFrom Saya’s point of view Luna was troubled with the promise her big brother made and she herself was anxious to let her brother meet that weird princess as well. But Saya knew that if Luna had agreed on the matter which meant she already have made necessary arrangement.\n‘When did I become dependent on her…’\nSaya had no idea when but slowly she has started to see Luna as someone she could rely on. On whom Saya could entrust her big brother on. Maybe it was the fact that Luna is stronger than her or maybe because it was the immense love Luna carries for him? Saya don’t know and she was not seeking an answer either.\nFor her, Luna was a figure on whom she can trust and if someone can keep her brother happy for his life then it could be only her.\n‘Yeah…it would be for the best…’\nJust when Saya was resigning her role to stay as Austin’s little sister as long as she can, cold water poured down her intention as Austin returned after chatting with Luna’s grandma for some minutes.\n“It seems, Celeria-san would be staying with Luna in her dorm, so let’s go and rest at my place Saya.”\nThe fact the conversation between Austin and the old lady lasted for a minute described they might be continuing their chat tomorrow. But this wasn’t the fact which made Saya shocked beyond belief at all.\n‘Me…and Onii-sama…under the same…for a whole night…!!!’\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nA/N:- There would be a chat between Kyouki and Luna in the following chapter as well, so look forward to it and drop a comment~",

      "content": "‘What should I do…’\nIt was nighttime in Eden’s Academy when Saya and Austin returned to the latter’s dorm after having a relaxing dinner at the cafeteria.\nLuna’s grandmother was also there. She seemed to be rather enthusiastic talking about Saya and Austin’s past and how come Saya calls him big brother.\nLuna has already told them in the afternoon that she didn’t share Austin’s and Saya’s reincarnation with anyone so Austin came up with some story and kept the conversation going. The old lady also didn’t seem suspicious and most of the time gossiped about Luna and her past which Austin eagerly entertained despite the adorable protest from the saintess.\nSaya was also surprised to hear so many things about Luna that she could never have imagined from someone like so cool and dignified. The most embarrassing part was when Celeria started to talk about Luna’s impression of Austin and how much she praises him, whenever the saintess visited her grandmother past months.\nLuna had a red face all the time and in the end, she dragged her grandmother away before she could pry in deeper secrets. However, the old lady promised Austin that she would continue their chat at a later date when Luna would not around. Austin readily nodded since knowing more about Luna seemed to carry his greatest interest.\nBack to the present. Currently, Saya was standing in the washroom of her brother’s dorm, pondering whether she really should go out wearing something indecent like this or not.\nCurrently, Saya had a black negligee on, which was mostly see-through except for the private part, fortunately. The two thin straps over her cream-white shoulder somehow held the weight of her bust which was giving a decent view of her cleavage. To check her attire, Saya put her arm under her breasts and saw the two globes, even more, enlarging in her arms, before the girl shyly let go.\nHer long legs were protruding sexily out of the dress and giving off a dangerous amount of view of her shaped thighs which despite being her slim stature, seemed a little bit on the meaty side. Even Luna has complimented her legs that’s why Saya picked this negligee where she could show her assets to her brother but now, she had a feeling that she overdid it.\nTwirling on her toes, she checked her back which was the least covered as a big ‘U’ was missing and her bare flawless back glimmered in the mirror. Without any makeup or other beauty products, her skin seemed this smooth after the bath but Saya had no mind to pay attention to that at the moment.\nShe sighed and took something of her spatial storage. The first thing was blood-red lipstick which she got from her brother. She steadily moved her fingers and painted her lips without any essence of smudge spread which gave a significant compliment to her tempting puffy lips.\nShe already had dried and combed her hair, so she just draped them over her shoulder to expose her nape and back in clear view. The last thing that remained was a perfume that Luna gave her just before she walked away to her dorm. Saya had no idea what it was, but she had enough trust in Luna that she didn’t joke with her.\nEven so, Saya inhaled the top of the perfume and found a very sweet fragrance exuding. Letting go of her remaining hesitation she sprayed the perfumed on her nape, wrist, and around her bosom.\n‘Sigh* I just hope it works…’\nExhaling deeply Saya clicked the door open, and while trying to keep her legs as steady as possible, she walked out of the washroom only to get startled at the sight with which she was greeted.\n“O-Onii-sama?”\nWith his toes pressed on the chair, Austin was doing declined push-ups. But the fact that he was topless made the scene enthralling enough to make Saya forget about her previous nervousness. The manly cuts around his arms and the way his sexy collarbone was in full display made Saya subconsciously gulp.\nHe was too damn hot to handle…\n“I thought since I have to wash up then why not do som-“\nAs Austin got up from the ground and stabilized his feet, his eyes naturally drew to the woman he was talking to. But when his eyes rested on Saya, his tongue halted in mid-way as his voice cracked.\nBut soon he pretended to be normal and finished his sentence as he approached the woman, who was his sister.\n“..some workout for a change.”\nSaya’s heart began to race as she smelt the profound raging manly pheromones in the air, as her brother walked in her direction. She was elated to see that even for a second his eyes traveled all over her body, providing a thrilling sensation for her to remember for the rest of her life.\nBut it was not the time to rejoice since her brother was now some inches apart from her and eyes are drawn to her face. Saya stood at her place, entirely frosted as she waited for her brother to walk away, which he usually would have done.\nBut….\n“You look beautiful Saya…” As he said, Austin tucked her glossy hair behind her small ear which was flushed enough that even Austin noticed who generally skim over such details.\n*BA*DUMB*\nHer heartbeat thumped audibly as she heard his compliment from this close along with his hot breath which brushed all over her face. His scent from this closeness made her feel slightly dizzy like she was getting drunk, but she held her ground and replied in a bold manner.\n“I am glad you liked it, Onii-sama…but you see, since it’s my first time wearing this…I-I am kinda nervous.”\nAustin can see how shy she was wearing such an adult-like dress which signifies she was not accustomed to such apparel. But even so, it suited her well and made it vivid how quickly she has grown when Austin was not with her.\nWith a smile, he put his hand on her left cheek and asked in a warm voice.\n“Then tell, your brother what he can do to calm his little Saya?”\nHearing the words she was expecting, Saya leaned her gaze downward and gathered the very last ounce of her courage to spread her arms meekly as with teary eyes she spoke in a delicate tone.\n‘T-Then…please h-hold me O-Onii-sama…”\n------------------------------------------------------------\nA/N:- It’s official that Saya would be his lover as well and no more spreading harem than two wives. If I write the second part of the story then you will find various cute scenes of these two.\nDrop a comment if you are hyped for the upcoming chapters~",

      "content": "“It’s surprising.”\nIt was after dinner when Celeria borrowed Luna for tonight from Austin since she wanted to have a peaceful chat with her granddaughter.\nAfter returning to the dorm Celeria and Luna took a bath and after changing into nightwear Luna had in her wardrobe, the pair sat on the bed with Luna’s head resting on her grandma’s lap.\nHearing her grandma’s words Luna glanced upward with a confused look.\n“What is?”\nCeleria ran her finger through Luna’s hair as she responded with a smile, “ That you are willing to share Austin with that girl, Saya.”\nLuna blinked in astonishment since she wasn’t the one who suggested Saya to be alone with Austin in the first place but still Luna wanted to give Saya some space so she can express her feelings for Austin.\nBut as Luna could expect from her grandma, she saw through her without Luna even saying anything about it.\n“If anyone can love Austin to the point where I can no longer keep them separated from him, then it’s her, grandma. “\nGazing at nothing particular, Luna expressed her genuine thoughts in a soft tone. For Luna, Saya can be the only one who has the right to love Austin and get reciprocated since that girl is the one who has taken care of Austin at times when Luna was not a part of his life.\nLuna has witnessed the immense feelings Saya carries for her brother to the point where she could sacrifice herself on the drop of a hat. Saya also preserves a peculiar admiration for her brother which Luna was never able to understand, but she didn’t dislike how Saya sees her brother.\nLuna might love Austin more than anyone but if there could be any second person below her, it could be only Saya.\n“You are not afraid that she might snatch him away?”\nHearing her grandma’s voice, Luna forced herself out of her daze as she rested her eyes on the old lady before replying in a more certain tone.\n“I believe in Austin and to a certain extent, I trust Saya as well. And even so, if she really tries to take him away, I have my ways to pull the string and bring Austin back to where he belongs~”\nCeleria was elated to see how brilliantly her granddaughter has grown up to and how Luna had control over things that she holds dear. Nothing less to be expected from her~\n“Ah, about your marriage, Luna. I have the ring for you.”\nLuna’s straightened her back instantly upon hearing the word ‘marriage’ as she looked at her grandmother with sparkly eyes.\nCeleria chuckled at Luna’s enthusiasm before she pulled out something from her spatial storage.\nIt was a violet small box which Luna carefully took from her grandmother and hastily lifted the upper case.\nThere rested a centimeter and half thick ring which was golden in color and a blue tear-like small gem embedded at its center. It looked beautiful and nothing extravagant in nature which Austin would probably like.\nBut knowing her grandma, Luna was expecting some mana-imbued special ring however Luna could perceive there was no signature of mana on the ring at all.\nFinding the slight frown on her granddaughter’s brows, Celeria sighed as she patted her shoulder and extinguished the little one’s doubts.\n“It’s not some ordinary ring, Luna. Actually, it will….”\n_____________________________________\nAustin was in a dilemma on how he should respond to his sister’s sudden request to be held by him.\nIn the past he never found any trouble hugging or cuddling with her since he always thought of her as a kid sister on whom he doted and pampered wholeheartedly.\nBut the current Saya was different. Let’s not talk about her physical appearance but her fragrance and aura were something that brought Austin on the edge.\nHe never took a notice of how Saya could blush so vehemently like she was suffering from either sickness or it was her embarrassment she was experiencing to be in front of him.\nBut why she would feel shy in front of him when he was her big brother?\nAustin didn’t know and this situation was overwhelming enough for him to get dizzy.\n“Come here.”\nHe inched forward and wrapped his arms around the girl as Saya trembled slightly feeling the foreign sensation enveloping her frame and caging her in such a stronghold.\nShe was stiff for a brief moment after she presented the selfish desire to be held by her big brother. She was extremely nervous upon the thought that what if her brother gets disgusted by her behavior or worst case scenario starts to dislike her?\nBut when he calmly gathered her in his embrace then she relaxed herself and let go of all her anxiety in a swift moment.\nShe had already decided to not hold back tonight which was why she didn’t remain passive and also snuggled as close she can to her brother. His manly scent actively wafted and made her enshrouded with his presence.\nHe was everything she can see or feel at the moment and it was the same for Austin as well, who strangely felt somewhat comfort and exhilaration at the moment when he had his sister in his arms. He might reprimand himself for such vulgar thoughts but at the moment he wanted to enjoy the moment with her.\nThat night none of them talked much after their short moment, however, there was a lot of things changed in their relationship and Austin was aware of those changes.\nEven if he want to, the instant he thought of Saya as a potential partner would never fade from his memories. And when he would look back in past, he would never feel regretful about this day at all.\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nA/N:- That brings a sweet closure to their relationship for this first half. Now Austin is at least aware of Saya.\nDrop a comment if you guys liked the chapter~",

      "content": "It was a very joyous occasion for Eden Academy and Capital of Gram since two of the well-known figures, legendary figures are going to be tied in the holy knot named marriage.\nIt was exactly a year since the first-year student was admitted to the academy and saw various ordeals in their first year. Either it was the brawl of the knight commander with Austin or the great war at the academy boundaries where if not for Austin, thousands of innocent lives would have been annihilated.\nDays went, the calendar flipped, and in the month of spring, the news of the most-heard names of the past year began to circulate even more as soon people heard of the auspicious event unfolding in the central cathedral of the capital.\nThe Saintess and the Savior were going to be wed and uncountable blessings would make the occasion memorable for everyone to remember down the history.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nIn a brightly lighted hall that had a stone furnished structure and a long conical top window carved at the side wall could be seen several figures currently giggling and gossiping with a sole beautiful young lady as its center.\n\"Never thought your day of marriage would arrive this soon, Luna-san. I am happy about you both~\"\nOne of the classmates who have shared a decent time with Luna during the start of the first ear sighed with her words as she hugged Luna's shoulder from the back while staring at the bride through the mirror in front.\nLuna just smiled shyly since whatever was being said today was only escalating her heartbeat, resulting in the maiden being all beet red with each comment.\n\"Awww~ Luna-san is so cute. I bet Austin would be in a daze once he sees you like this.\"\nAnother short girl chimed in whose words were being nodded by others as well since the current Luna was dangerously adorable. If not for the fact that no one was allowed other than some selected guests in the church, there were thousands of audience who came to catch a glimpse of the Saintess.\n\"Do you think, Sir Austin would be shy to kiss, Luna-san? Ne~ne, do you guys have already held hands?\"\nOne of the girls asked on which Luna felt stumped since she thought they were just teasing her but the expectation in their eyes told that it was the norm for the young generation to be slow in their relationship.\nLuna barely held herself from sighing as she parted her lips to reply when suddenly she sensed something and changed the words she previously intended to say.\n\"Now, you girls get going and join the others. The ceremony is about to start.\"\nThe girls grumbled since they wanted to tease the bride some more when they got the chance but it was true that the time of the ceremony was nearing so after some groans and well wishes they left.\nLuna sighed for a moment before she looked at herself in the mirror as she heard a familiar voice from the corner of the room.\n\"Should I throw him away?\"\nIt was Saya who was standing at the side without giving away her presence all this time, who suddenly spoke in regard to the sudden appearance of a certain someone.\nLuna contemplated for a bit before she shook her head and replied uncaringly.\n\"It's okay, and you may enter.\"\nThe last of her words were slightly louder to alarm the man who was standing just at the entrance of the bride's cabin, pondering whether he should be meeting Luna or not. But as the lady herself affirmed, he solidified his resolve and walked in with nervous steps.\n\"It's been a while...L-Luna.\"\nWalked in was a raven-haired young man wearing a formal black and white suit, with a nervous expression shrouding his features. His eyes were drawn to the bride as he felt himself falling into a daze, where it felt nearly impossible from recovering.\nKyouki always regarded Luna as the most beautiful person he has ever come across, regardless of how many beauties he has seen in the past, but right now, she couldn't be described with mere words.\nShe looked like a goddess descended to bless humanity with her presence.\n\"It's really been.\"\nThanks to Luna's reply, Kyouki was able to pull himself out of his stupor as he redirected his gaze in another direction to save himself from further embarrassment.\nLuna didn't take it as an offense as she turned herself and stood while facing the boy,\n\"So you are here to...?\"\nKyouki in a fluster pulled out a small box from his spatial storage before he shared his good wishes in a hurried tone.\n\"I...I just came to congratulate you and Austin. This is a small gift from me, Sicily, and Lilia. I hope you like it.\"\nLuna took the box and upon lifting the top she found a pair of pendants resting inside it which has a half heart carved at the end of each pendant, designed to be complete when the duo would be together.\nIt was beautiful enough to bring a smile to Luna as her reply came in a much softer tone.\n\"Thank you for the gift. And thank the other two as well for me.\"\n\"Ah...sure I will.\"\nAs Kyouki responded the atmosphere around the two became awkward as Luna stayed silent with her gaze awaiting the thing which Kyouki majorly came to say.\nKyouki was a little hesitant at first but soon he let go of his uncertainty and after landing his gaze on hers, he spoke in a gentle tone.\n\"I just want to thank you, Luna. Despite you never realized, you were the greatest motivation I had which helped me to always get stronger and look forward to a greater future. And I wanted to apologize as well for my past behavior toward you and Austin. Without considering your feelings I always imposed my thoughts and whatnot. Anyway, I can't ask you to forgive me but as a friend please don't hesitate to ask for me ever in the future, if you find my requirement.\"\nLuna stayed silent and despite wanting to stay something about the last part, she stayed silent and respected Kyouki's dignity. She particularly didn't like the boy but his past recent behavior has cleared out some clouds of hatred for him.\n\"I will be mindful of it, and you also take care of the girls.\"\nKyouki smiled with a nod before he walked away without any further ado.\nIn this life, he was never able to confess his love for the girl he has ever fallen for, but seeing the person who he dearly adore smiling beside someone else, was enough for Kyouki to rest assured.\nAnd like that Kyouki brought a final closure to this chapter of his life in which he never was the main character yet he was still contented with this happy ending.\n-----------------------------------------------------\nA/N:- Drop a comment if you are liking the story~",

      "content": "It was a special day for Austin for which he was both excited and anxious as well since it was the first time in his both life that he was going to be tied in a bond called marriage with the woman he could have only dreamt of if someone would had asked him a year ago.\nSure, he got engaged to Lilia and if things would have proceeded in the correct order and Austin wouldn't have had to act like a villain in mid-way then he would be marrying her in the near future. But looking back now, Austin was thankful for the system that made him do things that led to the engagement annulment.\nIf not for that night when Lilila insulted Austin in the middle of the whole crowd, maybe Luna would have never approached him in the first place, and maybe not anything that has been currently taking place would have transpired if not for that eventful day.\nAustin still could vividly remember that night when he was sitting in the corner of the garden of the academy while staring at Saya's almost lifeless profile through the tablet when a mysterious yet familiar scent approached him.\nIt surely was a really eventful day since thinking about such a prominent person as Luna approaching someone who has only acted rudely toward her and also pursued him to tell everything was entirely out of something that Austin could consider as a wishful imagination.\nYet, that night his soon-to-be bride consoled the near-broken Austin and gave him the courage to move forward in life. Despite his betraying her soon after during the expenditure, she returned to him and lend her shoulder at Austin's worst time when his family disowned him.\nLuna has stood beside Austin at his loneliest times when he had no one to rely on and always has thought of his best without asking anything in return. She truly is a goddess in his life and Austin knew, he was never worthy to be standing beside her yet he fought his fate and for his love, he dared to hold Luna as his.\nNow Austin has almost everything. He has the strength and godly potential to become a human who can protect the people he calls his beloved. He has his sister who was currently standing at the side and smiling at him with contentment. His mother, whom he always thought to be hateful to him, was sitting with other ladies in the audience seats with a joyous smile adorning her lips as she sent some prideful glances at Austin. There were professors and warriors along with the Prince of the nation as well who came just to attend his wedding because of the deed he has partaken in the past, signifying his current worth among the masses.\nThis fame, this strength, this love that he was receiving from so many people, might have never come face to face with Austin if not for a single person who held his hand and never let go of whatever it took.\nIndeed Austin was lucky to have Luna by his side and just like always he today as well, promises to god and himself that until his last breath arrives, he will take Luna's utmost care and never let her face any sorrow or grief. And for that Austin was ready to go on any length.\n***\nThe ceremony time was about to begin and everyone stood up from their seats as the choir began playing the music of the bride's arrival. The esteemed guests who were allowed to attend the marriage of the two legends were limited to a number however that number was enough to fill up the cathedral until the last row.\nAustin who was standing by the priest, held his breath as his eyes fell on the beautiful fairy advancing with slow steps toward him. Her eyes were covered with a veil however because of the fabric he could see her blue eyes directly staring at him, increasing his heart race to a further extent.\nThe white bride dress seemed so perfect that made it seem to Austin that this dress was made for Luna as he took his time to check out his wife and gave a hundred out of ten in his heart. Despite being a little too nervous he held himself perfectly and stepped down to take Luna's hand from Nordeik's.\n\"Take care of her, brat!\"\nLuna's uncle Nordeik's rough voice reached up to Austin to which the groom nodded vigorously with a cold sweat as he gently squeezed Luna's hand in anxiety-like he was holding her for the first time.\n\"You seem nervous, Mister Husband~\"\nAs Austin led her to the center, he heard Luna's teasing tone whispering only for him to hear which made Austin even more conscious about his actions.\n\"I mean can you blame me? Seeing you like this...I am barely able to stand still, you know.\"\nAustin replied truthfully as the current Luna was anything but healthy for his heart. Even her soft hand in his hold was making him sweat like a virgin loser but there was nothing he could do. It was his first time marrying someone damn it!\nLuna on the other side forgot all her nervousness to see the adorable reactions from her man as she giggled silently and made a mental note to tease Austin afterward.\n'\"Please maintain silence.\"\nAs the priest announced, he came forward with a book in his hand as he looked at the pair and with a nod began to narrate the vows.\n\"Father Charles, it would be not necessary.\"\nWhen the father was about to begin the vow, suddenly Austin shook his head on which the bald priest tilted his head however he soon understood Austin's intention.\nLooking directly in eyes of his wife, Austin who has been nervous since morning, suddenly grew calm and began to utter the words which he never learned yet just came off naturally from his heart.\n\"I, Austin, ask you, Luna Eldritch, that will you accept me as your better half. I might be not the coolest guy out there, but I can promise you a future where you wouldn't be alone in your worst or best. I wouldn't leave your side even if you ascend to godhood or grow old along with me. I promise that whatever happens to this world or whoever goes against us, I will always hold your hand and make you assured of my presence. I promise to always take your utmost care and never let you face any kind of worry if possible. I know it might sound cringe, but I promise that my love will far surpass any limit that you know of. And for the official vow, in richer or poorer, in sickness or in health, I promise to be your side. So tell me Luna will you accept a wannabe villain like me as your lawful husband?\"\nBy the time Austin finished his words, the smile of amusement from Luna's lips has already vanished as tears of joy clouded her expression. Hearing his words made her so delighted and fortunate to have this man, that she was no longer able to hold herself.\nFeeling the loss of words her mind was allowing her to, there was only one thing Luna could respond with using all the remaining energy she had.\n\"Yes...yes, I do accept you, my husband!\"\nLuna let go of the last thread of restraints as she jumped toward Austin and after removing her veil she planted her lips on his which Austin accepted with a contended smile as he supported his wife comfortably in his embrace.\nAnd like that, the wedding of the two living legends came to a conclusion as everyone presents inside the church cheered and shed tears of joy seeing the two in front. This day would forever be etched in history when the two heroes of the whole of humanity and this world united and were tied in the bond of marriage.\nOnly god knows what chapter and what deeds would these two be partaking in the future which not only this generation but many of future generations would remember as a legacy of the two entities who despite being just humans by origin, were able to pull things which even Gods shudder to think about.\nUntil that time, let's just raise a toast and congratulate the two love birds.\nCheers!\n------------------------------------------------------\nA/N:- And like that, the first half of the 'Isn't the Wannabe Villain too cute' comes to an end. I first thought to finish the story but just because the number of readers has decreased doesn't mean I would ruin the story so I have concluded to tear in two parts and probably write the next one depending on audience reviews in the future.\nIf I get positive reviews then we will meet shortly again with new chapters, and if not then it was a really memorable journey so far~\nDrop a comment and congratulate the newly weds~",
