      "content": "<\nKishikan\n>.(1) It is a word that means déjà vu.\nIt is a sensation that a memory has happened before, even though it has never been experienced in reality.\nMy life was full of <\nKishikan\n>. But mine is different from what déjà vu normally is – rather, it felt more like this “never happened before”.\nMy name is Lycoris Radiata. I just turned 6 years old. I am often told that my way of talking is not like a child. In impressions as well, rather than being called “cute”, the compliment that is usually given to me is “grown up”. Even though in my opinion, “cute” is the universal compliment for a child.\nMy social position is also remarkable – I was a duke’s daughter.\nMy mother, who died long before I could make sound judgement, had a lot of portraits that were left of her. Although she was very beautiful, she looked like she would have been a cold woman. My father, who is a duke, constantly travels to foreign countries due to his work. He rarely returns home. However, since there are a lot of servants and tutors at home, I never feel lonely.\nSince I am often praised on how good my memory is, I have often thought that it was my special skill. But when I carefully think about my memories like this, a sense of discomfort swells up.\nWrong. Wrong, absolutely wrong – there’s definitely something wrong, my heart would cry out. But “what” that something was, I don’t know.\nThis unexplainable uncertainty within me, I resolved to consult with a sensible adult.\nThe person who I chose, a familiar adult who I trusted deeply, was my wet nurse. When I confided to her my troubles with clumsy words, my nanny’s eyes widened her wrinkled eyes and said, “Oh my...”\nShe was bewildered for a while, and with a stunned expression she replied. “My lady, what you told me is too difficult for me to understand, <déjà vu=””>is a word that I am not accustomed to hearing”\n—-Come to think of it...\nWhere did the word <déjà vu=””>come from? How come I know that word? I thought that <déjà vu=””>was used in writing before, but from which country’s language did this come from?\nThe result of my resolve ended up with more questions that further increased my confusion.\nFrom then on, I eagerly began reading books. I sought the answers to my question from the wisdom of my ancestors. Aside from eating, sleeping, and studying, I spent nearly all my time reading.\nAbsorbed with reading a variety of books and having no interest in playing childish games, I was unaware of the divided opinions inside the Duke’s mansion on whether “Our lady is a genius” or whether “Our lady is crazy”.\nAround this time, I formed the habit of wrinkling my eyebrows. Exhaustive worry and overworked eyes are most likely the reason.\nI don’t like being a six-year-old.\nSeveral years have passed since I started a life of indiscriminate reading. To what was called <\nKishikan\n> that brought incomprehensible discomfort, one answer was brought forth.\nAn unforgettable day happened, just before my tenth birthday.\nOn this day, I heard about my fiancé from my father.\n「Hey... It’s been a while, hasn’t it, my little princess」\nThe teeth grinding greeting came from my father. The duke of Lilia was that kind of person.\n「It seems you are well, Father」\nWhile giving a greeting unlike that of a child to a parent, I stared at my father’s face motionlessly.\nWith combed slick back hair that had combined colors of gold and brown, the impression of a baby-face could not be wiped off from his face.\nOnly having hit thirty years old, with a presence more like a young nobleman than a duke, the impression that he was my father is weak.\nIt’s not as if I’m questioning my blood relation to him. It’s just that the time we talk as parent and child is too little.\nWith majority of the year spent outside the country, on those rare occasions he comes back, however, he’s the type of father that will bring souvenirs without fail. It’s hard to say whether this person thought about his actual daughter or not.\nBrightly giving endearing words to his daughter, there wasn’t a chance this father was anywhere reserved.\nThis situation, which was explained based on the souvenirs, looks as if he enjoys spending time with his daughter.\nHowever the other party, as a duke, displays competency in diplomacy. The subtle emotions of a young lady probably wouldn’t get past him. Is that really a heart-felt smile? Or is it a trick he learned due to sociability? ...Or could it be that I had over-analyzed it too much?\nThere is one thing that I can say about my father,『I don’t know whether I dislike him or not』.\nThat same father, while smiling and laughing, held out a hand gesturing me to sit on the sofa.\n「I came to tell you great news」\nOnce he began the introduction, with a few words, my normal everyday life collapsed.\n「Your fiancé has been oficially decided. That person is Viscount Wolfgang Eisenhut. Duke Ranuncula’s first born child. His heir. I borrowed a recent painting of him」\nWhen my father mentioned it, a butler that was at the side of the wall came out with an oil painting, taking several steps closer so that the painting was easily visible.\n「What do you think? He’s a pretty boy, isn’t he? Tomorrow is your first meeting with him. I’m certain you’ll like him」\nMy father’s voice seemed far away, as my gaze was glued to the picture.\nToday, my everyday life until that point and the life that I had hoped, in one morning, shattered. This was by no mean an exaggeration.\nWolfgang Eisenhut.\nWhen I heard that particular name, something flashed through my eyes. It felt like I had just awoken – the feeling as if I was stumbling through the dark and then suddenly given light.\nDéjà vu. The strange knowledge. Everything was connected.\nThat déjà vu was my 『former life』. The knowledge was also gained from my 『former life』.\nThe name, Wolfgang Eisenhut, was also included that memory. Embracing a woman with soft golden hair, the grown up version of the young man in the portrait whom I had just laid eyes on, came to mind.\nRather than saying it was an accurate portrait, it looked like it was actually a still picture from the game.\nFrankly, if you want to form this situation into a phrase...\nIt seems like I got reincarnated with some of the memory from a previous life.\nInside the world of a yandere otome game.\nFurthermore, my position was the rival character of the golden haired heroine. And there was a death route available for me.\nThis is bad.\nIn more than one way.\nThe reincarnation part is okay. I loved reading those kinds of stories.\nBut, why was it a world of a yandere otome game of all things?\nAs a game player, if you get in contact with a capturable character, whether it be a Tsundere or a Yandere, it wouldn’t be scary. But, in real life, you wouldn’t ever want to meet a Yandere.\nYou might be able to endure the cutting words that a Tsundere brandishes, but would you be able to endure a kitchen knife that a Yandere brandishes? Absolutely not.\nNo, actually the kitchen knife was just my imagination. In the game, there was no scene like that.\nIn any case, when confronting a Yandere, an LCD screen was the strongest shield required. Seriously.\nEven more, if the heroine doesn’t have any special skills to compensate, if for example, a Yandere appears as an obstructive supporting character, it’s no different from being in the same league as when you encounter a zombie. Give me a shotgun!\nNo – I wouldn’t really shoot though.\nI’ll say it again.\nThis is bad.\n(1) She first used the japanese term, “kishikan”. Before using the french word “deja vu”. When she consulted with her nurse, she used the latin word and that resulted in the confusion.\n</déjà></déjà></déjà>",

      "content": "Telling my father a suitable excuse (the contents of which I couldn’t remember), I withdrew to my room to clear my muddled thoughts.\nIf I believe the sudden memories that overflowed within me, then I have just obtained the memories of my past life.\nAre these... really memories from my previous life, or are these just well-thought out fantasies? With these questions, a practical answer was brought out. That is, when the time comes, and I end up getting my foot stuck from going forward because I couldn’t see, then at that time, I’ll stop.\nIn the meantime, I decided to believe in myself. These were my memories from a previous life.\nThe “me” from my previous life was an office lady that was from Japan. In the administration division of a small company, I would stare at numbers and grappling with the photo-copying machine everyday. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a lover. But if I could have had 3 – no, 5 more years, I would have had an incredibly electrifying romance.\n— is what I like to believe.\nI died due to a traffic accident. If it was painful or if it was scary, I was fortunate enough not to remember. But I did remember feeling frightened when I saw myself about to get struck by a car. At that time, I felt like I received a huge shock, but now, it felt like the incident happened much too fast.\nDying earlier than my parents might make me a person who lacks respect to her own family. But I’m fortunate enough to have siblings that will take care of my parents in their later years, so I have nothing to worry about.\nAlthough I might incline my head from doubt to most claims that something could be achieved in a person’s short span of life, I did believe that living life to the fullest would grant eternal peace.\nOn a different note, since a while ago, the thoughts that came flowing naturally before has started making my head hurt when I got more details. When I overworked the limited operations of my nerves, an unpleasant feeling overwhelmed me.\nThanks to that, I could only remember a few detail about each individual’s life. In spite of that, strangely enough, I could vividly remember the few details about them. For example, how I used to play a game... that had those characters.\nWiping my head with a handkerchief to cool down from a fever that broke out, I found myself standing. (1) In front of the full length mirror, an actor half its size looked to be also standing.\nIt feels uncomfortable finding myself reflected in the mirror, and it might be because I know the reason why. Oddly, and without hesitating, I had the urge to face my own reflection.\nA girl in a crimson dress stared back at me. When I raised my hand, the girl in the mirror raised her own. And when I pulled at the corners of my lip, the girl in the mirror also made a firmly funny-looking face.\nBlack hair and white skin under a monotone color scheme and, whether it was painted on or not, red lips and cheeks that attracted attention. With that, the name “Snow White”, from my past life came to mind, but the projection in the mirror did not feel like the princess in the fairy tale story. What I mean is, not only did I have a pair of slightly intense-looking upturned eyes, I also had – although it’s small – a mole under one eye.\nThe crimson dress, which was far from the impression of cute and refreshing, might also be a contributing factor. It seems like it is the image color for the Lilia household. Almost all the dresses that come out of the wardrobe also appeared to be of this color.\nAlthough I filled my smile with charm as much as I could, I felt extremely embarrassed, so I stopped.\n（With this appearance, even in the game... laughing didn’t fit this image）\nThe game’s Lycoris Radiata. The『Me』- no, let us call her『That girl』- that girl was the heroine’s rival, or to be exact, the villain of the game.\nIncidentally, when Wolfgang Eisenhut and the heroine became involved in a youthful love, she was the obstacle that had to be climbed over.\nAppearing as Wolfgang Eisenhut’s fiancée, she was known to rampage aggressively. She, who had an unusual obsession over her family-chosen fiancé, injured the heroine with her relentless bullying, carried out many acts of intimidation, and even used self-injury to get her way. A truly frightening woman. She was, as some might call, a yandere.\nBut then, she wasn’t the only yandere in the game. The male character, Wolfgang, was also of the same sort. Furthermore, the heroine’s other love interests’ all had yandere tendencies as well.\n（The game’s title was... huh?）\nSomehow, I couldn’t remember it. And to think, I could remember the game’s content so well.\nHow weird. I had the feeling it certainly wasn’t Japanese, I wonder if my catastrophic English proficiency was to blame.\nDespite agonizing over that fact for a while, I felt like my head was sluggish and heavy. For some reason, I couldn’t clear my head, so I decided to give up.\nIn any case, because there were all sorts of developments and violent actions in it, the game was given an adult rating.\nWay before its release, there were a lot of discussion over it. The director and main scenario writer was a shotacon who loved yandere.（Even when he was a novelist, he was known to write those kinds of stories）Additionally, the person responsible for the sub scenario gave users a lot of psychological damage, showing that he was also the type to enjoy writing those stories. And among other things, the person who was previously in charge of the endings had a habit of adding in the cruelest of bad endings.\nConsidering these, the advertised text, which was released earlier than the game’s title, was 『More and more... you’ll want to be killed』\nThe actual『Lycoris Radiata』and the me now were two completely different people, so this sales message was unthinkable. Although the『you』referred in the message was definitely the game’s heroine, it could’ve referred to Lycoris, as she was subsequently and swiftly killed.\nI could vividly remember a portion of that ending.\nAfter Lycoris harmed the heroine, she ended up getting killed by Wolfgang; Then he and the heroine ran away and led a fugitive life. Burdened with a high social standing, he, who didn’t trust even his own family and bounded with obligations, threw everything away so that he could be together alone with his beloved person. A merry bad ending.\nThat is what I absolutely want to avoid.\nNot only did I die, I also burned myself out in that hopeless sense of love. On top of that, I definitely don’t want to become a hurtful human that could only harm everyone around her.\nLycoris might have been just a supporting character in the game, but, right now, I am the brilliant and sparkling hero of my life. The one and only lead.\nAdding to my determination, I glared at the mirror. I will definitely find happiness.\nBut – just as I was about to conclude things after organizing the information, Father’s words came back to me in a flashback.\n「Tomorrow is your first meeting with him. I’m certain you’ll like him」\nFirst meeting. With whom, you say?\nYour fiancé.\nThe fellow that could possibly kill you in the future, that’s who.\nBlood quickly drained from my entire body. All of a sudden, the situation went downhill.\n(1)知恵熱 – teething fever; developmental fever, fever that brings with it an intellectual or psycho-developmental growth spurt",

      "content": "Just in case, I made an effort to avoid the situation.\nWhen I visited my father for the second time, I resorted to playing the part of duke’s weak daughter with all my might. Saying things like: I don’t want to meet my fiancé, tomorrow’s meeting is way too soon, and『Rather than hate, I’m afraid of meeting him 』, I appealed with tear-filled eyes of which, weren’t part of the act.\n「In any case, if you don’t meet the person, you wouldn’t know whether you’ll dislike him, right? Since I’ll be coming along, I’m sure it’ll be fine. For now, just go to sleep.」\nThat’s right. I’ll go back. This is what an adult does.(1)\nAnd so on the next day, in a horse-drawn carriage that rocked to and fro, I headed to my fiancé’s residence, Duke Ranuncula’s mansion, to meet him.\nI heard the trip would usually take around ten days or more with a carriage.\nWhat played a big part in the shortened voyage was the teleportation tower. As a fairly large-scale magical tower, it was indispensable as a continental long-range transportation.\nWe jumped from the lone teleportation tower in the Dukedom of Lilia to the – similarly – only tower in the Dukedom of Ranuncula. With that, the ten-day trip was reduced to half a day.\nThat ten-day trip sounded nicer.\nMoreover, if we arrived at the destination of a lifetime, it would’ve been even better.\nThat was my current state of mind.\nNevertheless, time was too cruel for being too quick, I thought, as I stepped out of my carriage and into the battlefield without so much as a plan.\n（I screwed up......）\nAs I down on the soft chair at the reception area, regret swiftly overcame me.\nSitting beside me, my father, who noticed my terrible complexion, recommended a warm drink. However, feeling like it wouldn’t likely pass through my throat, I declined.\nWhen I say “screw up”, I mean about the fact that from night till morning, I was anxious about various things and as a result, didn’t get any rest at all. I could’ve had some time to sleep in the quiet carriage, but instead, I had stared out the window in order to escape reality.\nIf the engagement doesn’t follow through, I can at least rest easy – It would be nice if my physical condition improves after I come back from this place.\nNo use crying over spilled milk, is the maxim I reflected on as I waited. Soon after, a knock resounded across the room.\nIn accordance, my father stood up and greeted the person who entered.\nWith hair mixed with white, the person who entered the room with brisk movement, was a good-natured old man. Next to him, with glossy black hair, was a young boy.\nI intentionally cleared any expression from my gaze. It was the proper behavior for a lady when being introduced to another person. Although, it might not seem proper for a child.\nWhen the gentleman finished exchanging greetings with my father, he immediately turned his gaze towards me.\n「Let me introduce you, Duke Ranuncula. This is my daughter, Lycoris. Lycoris. This is his excellency, Duke Ranuncula」\nIntroducing the duke to me, and vise versa with very concise words, my father pulled me forward. Naturally, I ended up directly facing the gentleman.\n「It is an honor meeting you. My name is Lycoris Radiata.」\nAfter ending my bow, I spotted a gentle smile on his face. His eyes, which were very clear but in a shade similar to when peering into a deep deep ocean, crinkled in a smile.\nCompared to my father, Duke Ranuncula was much older; he should be close to around fifty years old. His old age was evident from the visible wrinkles on his face and hands.\n「Yes, it’s nice to meet you too – but having said that, I’ve already met you when you were a baby though」The duke said with a light-hearted tone before kissing the back of my hand. His white speckled grey mustached traced over my hand, tickling the thin skin.\nWhen I mentioned that, the corners of the duke’s eye wrinkled even further. After sharing a good laugh together, our short conversation ended.\n「You grew up to be quite charming that you surprised me. Although, you got the hair and eye color from your mother, you definitely inherited the shape of your eyes from your father」\nWith those words that voiced the similarity between my father and I, my father became a bit flustered and returned it with a “I’m often told that”.\nAs for me, I became unnerved for being called “charming”, a compliment that I was unaccustomed to hearing.\n「But you don’t look so well. It seems like you’re exhausted from the long journey. Is it your first time riding a carriage for such a long distance? 」\nWorry and sympathy filled his light blue eyes. Then he placed a warm hand on my shoulder and with a gentle voice said「It’s okay to sit down」, as he urged me to do so.\n「I-I’m alright. It’s better if I stand or walk, at least I can get distracted...」\nIn vain, I stuttered an answer.\n「As I thought, it was because I asked you to come here. I’m really sorry」\n「No! Uhm... I like going to new places. It was refreshing to get to view the sea in a large town. And I got to see the windmills at the main roads, it was very interesting to get to see the sights for the first time... ah – no, what I mean is, today, I was incredibly happy to be invited here」\nWhen I finished giving him nothing but greetings, I felt ashamed because it ended up turning into a weird babble. It was unusual for me to be jittery like this.\nThankfully, Duke Ranuncula looked happy as he smiled and laugh asking me to describe to him the shape of the windmills.\nSeeing him listening to my story attentively, I was astonished from the bottom of my heart.\nWith a sincere smile on his face, this was our country’s prime minister.\nThis country was a monarchy – under the noble royal family stood five dukedoms. Among them were the Dukedom of Ranuncula and my very own, the Dukedom of Lilia, and so the standing of a prime minister was established within the nobility.\nWith that standing, and my bias that he was above all 『That yandere man’s father』, I didn’t expect that he would turn out to be a good-natured man. It was very rude of me. I shall reflect on it.\nThat Prime minister-sama(2), said「Your hunger for knowledge is truly a remarkable talent」with a smile that couldn’t be mistaken for anything but joy.\nHonestly, I felt my heart throb.\nHow much did it throb? Well, it was so much that I momentarily forgot the existence of the yandere – I mean, my fiancé, next to him.\nFather, who stood behind me, cleared his throat, and I finally recalled the purpose of this visit.\nI sent a sidelong glance to the young boy next to Prime Minister-sama.\n「I’m terrible sorry. Lycoris, let me introduce you to my son」\nPrime Minister-sama’s big hands guided the ten-year old, Wolfgang Eisenhut to stand forward; the boy gave the barest of greeting,「Best regards」with his eyes on the floor.\nWith a「Same here」returned to him, our conversation was cut off.\nThe atmosphere in the room grew dead silent, causing the two adults to grow anxious.\n「Our conversation will be complicated」\n「Lycoris, why don’t you take my son to the gardens?」\nWith a sudden『Go take a stroll...』, the two ten-year old children were thrown out to the gardens.\nThis wasn’t what you’d expect from a scheme made by an appointed minister who supports a country – Honestly, this was a poor plan.\nFirst of all, the two adults should’ve soften it up by bringing up a topic, the right thing to do would be give one or two common topics for the two of us to talk about. But as I began thinking, I felt like I was playing the role of a woman who did a lot of matchmaking in a drama. Even if a man could work for a living, he might be weak at playing as a matchmaker.\n... realizing I went off track, I shook my head.\nThe young boy, who continued to walk together to with me to the garden, was a slender good-looking youth.\nWhether it was unexpected or not, or maybe it was due to our age, but between the two of us who were in the same age, he was comparatively shorter.\nHis black hair and violet eyes were astounding.\nAnd even though the outline of his cheeks were of a young boy, he had plenty of intellectual features. His form had a steady movement as he walked smoothly; although, it might be because he is aware that a lot of people pay close attention to him that he developed this gift.\nThough the game characters had an outlined image color associated to each of them, for him, that color was just black. During work, he would only wear black clothes. Even now, he was wearing an expensive outfit with silver embroidery that was certainly black.\nWhen the rose arch of the garden was nearly visible, that beautiful young boy blocked my path as we were about to arrive and said.\n「You – do you understand what it means to be decided as my fiancée?(3)」\nBecause it happened too fast, my reaction was delayed and all I could do was nod my head.\nThat beautiful young boy, with his astounding violet eyes, quickly glared at me.\n「Yup. I don’t like you. Your face is okay, but to begin with an overall gloomy person is not my type. Not only that, you’re way too big. –But, your linage balances it off. I’ll compromise. Don’t you dare misunderstand your position as my fiancée and think of telling anyone about my behavior」\nAh... That’s right.\nHe had this kind of character.\nWhile thinking that in the corner of my head, in truth, my feelings were filled relief.\nMy worst fears didn’t happen.\nI mean that at the moment I met Wolfgang Eisenhut, I didn’t change.\nWithout understanding my heart’s working, wasn’t I unable to control my feelings and nearly grew to like him? Although I knew about my destruction before hand, didn’t his dazzling eyes almost pierced the passion of my heart. It was most frightening.\nYeah. It’s good. It is....『Not』.\nThat’s because I’m not masochistic.\nI want to hit this cheeky brat on the head.\nBut I’m already an adult from my previous life. It would be impossible not to have obstacles as a life experience.\nI pulled my own eyes down, enjoying the fact that I could laugh at him under my nose.\n「If you prefer a smaller body, then yours would be suitable」\nAh, it slipped.\n(1) A bit ironic since she’s being sent to her room by her daddy...\n(2) Really, I’ll stick to this translation until someone gives me a better one. Because god damn, that little lady has the hots for that gentleman...\n(3) In here, he uses the pronoun (ore). It will be a detail later mentioned in chapter 4",

      "content": "If you wonder what happened with Wolfgang Eisenhut after the words spilled out of my mouth.\nWell, his eyes only widened with bewilderment.\n（H-huh? Somehow I was thinking of a different reaction）\nFor one, I was expecting the image of him transforming into a fire-breathing dragon. And naturally, a hate-filled glare along with it.\nHaving my hands in front of me in a complete stance had become a waste of effort\nIf I illustrated his current situation, it would be like encountering a cat as an unknown enemy. Rather than caution, it was surprise that was greatly bred.\nGuessing from his reaction, it seems like the young boy has never experienced insults from anyone of the same age. Actually now that I think about it, even if the person was an adult he wouldn’t normally face any rebuttal from them.\nHis father is the duke; it won’t do to call his son short.\nA cold sweat ran down my back.\nAnyone who lives in modern day Japan would most likely agree with me when I say this. I certainly don’t want to be a victim, but I also don’t want to be a perpetrator.\nEven if the other person was a yandere in the future. Right now, by answering back with a similar remark, it ended up becoming a breakdown of a mentally weak child. My earlier remark was not befitting an adult.\n「Uhm, that was rude. I’ll apologize, that was inexcusable」\nMy words became an opportunity to melt the ice, Wolfgang’s face flared up with blood.\n「D-don’t think I’ll forgive you!」\n「Hah. Well, I’d be fine even if you don’t forgive me 」\n「...tch!」\nHis white face became red like a ripened tomato. It might be because he is young, but it doesn’t seem likely to see any blood vessels popping from him.\nSpeaking of which, I wonder how much this young boy gets spoiled every day. To be so surprised by someone just answering him back.\nAlthough Duke Ranuncula was a fine gentleman, I wonder if he’s the type of father that couldn’t scold his son. If I’m not mistaken, people in their later years tend to cherish their children more.\n（...nh? Come to think of it）\nI arrived at a certain possibility.\n「Umm... about Duke Ranuncula, he usually lives in the imperial city right?」\n「Are you planning to tell my father?!」\nI wouldn’t have thought it’d be this cute that he got scared thinking I was planning on telling on him, I forced myself to give him a civil smile.\n「No. I’m not planning on doing such a thing, so could you engage me in some idle talk?」\nGlaring at my proposal, the young Wolfgang looked like a cautious cat with hair sticking out from its body. The smile aimed at softening him was downright fake.\nI repeated my words to somehow ease his wariness.\n「I’m interested in your relationship with your father... my father has to travel all over the country because of his work, so I don’t get to see him often. If you live apart for a long time, you end up not having anything to talk about. Since Duke Ranuncula is busy, wouldn’t he be staying at the capital all the time?」\nWhen I revealed my intention, the other person’s interest was slightly piqued.\n「It’s true, my father is usually at the capital. He only comes back a few times a month.\nTalking about your problems with Duke Lilia was unexpected. You’re quite the talkative lady」\n「Yes... however, the only thing we can talk about is our fathers – my father is eloquent at conversations, but he can’t follow any of the fun stories I give. In that situation, wouldn’t family conversations feel lonely then?」\nThat was supposed to ease his worries, but I ended up saying more than I expected.\nHowever, it looked like it paid off. The young Wolfgang, who had an earnest expression, began opening his mouth.\n「...I don’t think my relationship with my father should be used as reference. We don’t often communicate with each other as well. When I report the results of my studies, he would only give me a compliment to some extent. Although, a long time ago when mother was still alive, it wasn’t like this」\n（This person... is he aware that he shifted from the first person pronoun『Ore』to 『watashi』?(1) I feel that his use of 『watashi』makes us feel closer.）\n「What was your mother like? In my case, my mother died a long time ago, so I can’t really remember her」\nMumbling,「I see... That is...」, he tried to offer his heartfelt condolences. No matter how mature a child is, he wouldn’t know how to express his condolences in words. He would have no experience with it after all.\nI lifted my skirt in a curtsey offering thanks, telling him that his feelings were conveyed. It seemed that he understood my action, as his expression loosened.\n「...my mother – she passed away four years ago. She wasn’t a very talkative person, and she rarely rebuked or compliment. But no matter what, she would always watch over me. She was a beautiful, gentle person」\nInadvertently revealing that he yearned for a past that was long gone, he then added「It was just a common expression」embarrassedly. Hearing that child-like confession, I felt my heart breaking.\nEven though I recalled yesterday’s facts, I did have a previous life. Although he was born as an innocent baby, he only had six years to spend with his mother.\nFor me, when I instinctively hear the question 「Are you lonely?」, I always reply that I have servants and tutor, so I don’t feel lonely.\n「How about friends?」\n「There’s no children I can associate with in the mansion」\n「Same goes for me」\nThe two of us looked at each other and sighed.\n『Our high social standing is really inconvenient, huh』, and so we began to sympathize with each other.\nAlthough we had our differences as a boy and a girl, our circumstances were similar.\nBoth our mothers passed away. Our fathers were always busy, so we rarely saw them. Between servants and tutors, and the like – we were only surrounded by adults because of our circumstances, we didn’t have anyone of the same age to play with us.\nI decided to switch the conversation about family to something else.\nStarting from political science and history, we moved to recent books we found interesting, to even our horse-riding skills.\nHaving interest in those fields meant that he was an avid reader, so my conversation with him was quite interesting.\nBecause of our entertaining discussion, I eventually told him a secret I kept even from my own father.\nIt was about the time I went exploring the town alone.\nAccurately put, there was a servant who accompanied me in my whim to go to town. But then, taking advantage of his enthusiasm in haggling with the merchants, I separated from him to take a walk in town for a while. That was pretty much it.\nBut for me it was a big adventure. Since I keep it a secret from the adults knowing they will get angry for my safety, I got tempted to tell a child my age about it.\nWolfgang answered my expectations. At first he was surprised, but then he gave me some words of admiration.\nAt that time, I wasn’t aware because I was a little bit gleeful.\nLooking back on it, I think that at that time, my usual way of talking using the careful『watakushi』 turned into 『watashi』. Something I don’t use with anyone.\nIt might be an excuse, but the unrestraint conversation we had when we met was the first I had in this life.\nCompared to my wet nurse, he was someone that I can consult with, as my nanny was above all, a servant whose duty was to take care of me. Although her existence was close to family, it was far from a friend.\nTime flew by too quickly as we surprisingly had a fun time.\nWhen the two of us came to our senses, both our fathers, who were unable to hold back the weird looks on their faces were, for some reason, smiling as they called us back for dinner.\nAt that time, we began calling each other, Wolf and Lycoris.\nHey me, what are you doing getting friendly with him for?\n(1)\nIn the previous chapter, he was using (ore) , now he switched to (watashi). (Watashi) does feel more intimate than the arrogant-sounding (ore) in my opinion.",

      "content": "Finishing our luxurious, but moderate meal for dinner, the adults began drinking liquor. My father has been in high spirits since the events this afternoon.(1)\nFather is the type of person who normally doesn’t drink alcohol at home, though I would say he doesn’t like drinking it too much either, but well – there are probably those times you just feel like drinking.\nWanting to talk with Wolf a bit more, I decided to invite him to go to the mansion’s library and had him guide me there.\nI had just the right topic I wanted to talk to him about.\n—\nMagical lights illuminated the library at night.\nFor a place that was highly flammable, magical lights were the best. There weren’t any worries of anything catching fire, and it could be sustained for a long period of time without oil. Furthermore, since it was unlike the unstable flickering flames, it was easier for me to follow the words in a book with my eyes.\nAlthough it is a high-class item, it is a frequently used light fixture. Light is produced by exposing a palm sized orb inside the glass container to morning sunlight. During the night, this light is constantly used. It was simple to imagine it as rechargeable solar power.\nThe only problem with it is that unlike an electric light, you can’t turn it off with a switch. Since we lacked that flexibility, we would turn off the lights by covering them with thick blackout-like cloths.\nUnder those magical lights, we talked about each of our recommended books. Having said that, we actually did as we pleased – straying off to any topic that sparked our interest.\nAlthough our freewheeling discussion was senseless, and any adult who listens in might call it nonsense, it was fun for me. Perhaps, it was fun for Wolf as well.\n—\nNo one would have found fault with it, but somehow, we were both speaking softly. This excusable『night activity』of a child probably wouldn’t do any harm.\nBut for children like us, once the adults find out, they would try to put an end to it. If the adults noticed that we were doing something in the middle of the night, we would be told『children should go to sleep』, and then they would take away that precious time.\nThose whispered conversations were soon cut short. At that moment, I directed the discussion to an important topic.\n「Hey, Wolf... About our engagement...」\nCaught off guard from my sudden words, Wolf could only respond 「Eh?!」while raising his voice.\n「It’s about the engagement our fathers were talking about. It’ll be problematic in a lot of ways – I’m not sure if our fathers are serious about it, but in any case, I want to clearly declare my intentions」\nSince I thought that I had built a fairly good relationship with Wolf, I wanted to be as open as I could with him.\nWhen the part of『problematic in a lot of ways』was said, Wolf demanded to know what it was about.\nMy engagement with Wolf was, in truth, a slightly dangerous gamble for the Dukedom of Lilia. In the carriage, I hurled the question to my father and found out about his speculation.\nThat question was of course, whether it was right to get the Duke of Lilia’s only daughter – me – to marry into the other family.\nEven though I couldn’t inherit my father’s court rank, my relatives could choose a husband for me – meaning to say, it would likely be a safer option.\nNot accepting that reasoning, my father said『a capable person that could make such a judgment doesn’t exist』.\nAnd then, my father asked whether he could use my youth as a gamble. Hoping for me to marry Wolf – the current minister’s son who had a good family, wit and his approval(2) – my father considered having the child of that matrimony, that is, his grandson, to inherit the title of Duke of Lilia.\nIn other words, I would have to have at least two children to succeed both lines of the Dukedom of Lilia and the Dukedom of Ranuncula; furthermore, he was betting on the possibility that I would be able to give birth to two sons.’\nBy announcing my engagement with Wolf, the number of people knowing about my father’s speculation would increase. Not only would there be opposition if two of the powerful families within the five Dukedoms were to bind together through this marriage, but even within my own family – my relatives would think that their own sons would be more appropriate as the next Duke of Lilia.\nPersonally, I also don’t feel satisfied with this explanation. After all, this isn’t my will.\nBut even so, I was grateful that my father explained the various circumstances to me. That was my father’s sincerity to me, and I must show that same sincerity to him. Meaning that, at the very least, I needed to oppose my father head on, in order for me to convince him.\nInitially, Wolf’s personality would be difficult, thus, I prepared this evidence as a reason, but...\n「Why don’t we cooperate?」\n「Cooperate?」\n「Yes. Because this talk about engagement, frankly speaking, you oppose it too, right?」\n「...Eh?」\nWas he aware that he’s only been either repeating my words or pronouncing the syllable「Eh」since a while ago?\n「I mean – I understand there are various circumstances regarding the lineage and the duke’s title, but they completely ignored our feelings in this. We’re only children. We don’t know who we’ll meet in the future」\nOr to be specific, once Wolf begins school at the age of twelve, he was destined to meet with the soft golden-haired, emerald-eyed young girl. However, they would only meet six years later — because it will happen at the peak of our school life, this will be a talk for a later time.\n「That’s why, I don’t think we have to follow through our parent’s arrangement to marry. But if we just turned down this engagement, wouldn’t our families just bring forward new proposal arrangements?」\n「...」\n「Hear me out on this. All we have to do is stop pretending that we are both satisfied with an engagement; I want you to bear in mind that if you ever want to marry someone else, I am willing to help you」\n‘So please don’t stab me to death, okay?’, is what I didn’t say.\nWith utmost sincerity, I brought up the talk about coping with our engagement and consider the conclusions.\nWolf was better than how I imagined him to be – no, he was originally imaginary to begin with – therefore, he was an exceptionally good human that could rationally comprehend the conversation and understand the compromise.\n「And, how about you...?」\nThat’s why, when the dark tone came out of Wolf’s voice, it was completely unexpected.\n「Do you also have another person you want to get married to? Is that why you don’t think anything of me?」\nWolf’s hand stretched out, grabbing my wrist.\nIt wasn’t like the strength of his hold caused me pain, but since it was sudden – as if the hand had stretched out from the darkness, I felt shocked.\n「... What are you talking about?」\nIn contrary to my attempt at shaking off his hand, the hold on my wrist only grew stronger, pulling us closer.\nEven though I was taller, Wolf’s hands were remarkably bigger than mine. It was natural since he practiced with a sword, but surprisingly, even his grip was strong.\nUnable to free myself from his hold, I got sucked into his deep violet eyes and was drawn closer.\n「Saying that『We don’t know who we’ll meet in the future... 』,from the way you’re speaking, you’re taking away the possibility of me being your partner. That is why, I’d like to hear whether you’ve already had that so-called fateful encounter. Is there a man you like?」\nHis voice sounded as if he was questioning a lover caught cheating, so I was taken by surprise.\nAbsurdly, my face became red; at any rate, I denied his claims by shaking my head. So much so, that I could hear buzzing as I swung my head.\nAnd so, Wolf who had been furious until now, eased up. I was a little startled to hear a sigh coming from him.\n「In your case... how many men do you know in your life? No, it would only be natural for a duke’s daughter...」\n「Eh? Are there any girls around you, Wolf? U-uhm, like a beautiful maid onee-san, perhaps? Or...」\nAlthough he doesn’t have any friends, he might be leading an unknown life with a sex friend. And so, giving reign to my imagination, I made a revolted face.\n「There’s no way that could be true. I’m innocent. But there are some people who take in servants as their lovers, and within the royal palace, the coming and going of these scandalous relationships between men and women reach my ears even when I don’t want to」\nTalking about these love affairs, it was as if Wolf was pointing out that I grew up as a sheltered princess. The feelings of both a friend and a younger brother towards the unpredictable Wolf for some reason, made me remember his irritation from a moment ago.\nWolf’s hand, which was holding my wrist from the resulting chaos, still remained.\nAlthough it didn’t hurt, somehow, it was making that spot on my wrist warmer. Not only that, his face is close.\nLeveraging on my previous life’s memories, I wanted to say something that could startle him to let go. But I haven’t the slightest idea on what to say. Jokes? Information on health insurance?\nIn the game, Wolf was generally a bit fussy about everyone else except the heroine, so wasn’t he someone who hated women? It’s probably too late to say this. But how can anyone make such an excuse when he is this close.\nI. Am. Confused.\nSeeing my confusion, Wolf suddenly made a grown-up smile. Although I called it grown-up, it was somewhere closer to a nasty smile.\n「In other words, you said those things without even having experienced those feelings」\nI don’t want to hear that coming from a ten-year old! Ever!\n「Rather than yearning for a prince from a story, it’s better to consider a man you can see in front of your eyes」\nI also don’t want to hear that either! Whether it’s yearning for a prince or something else, I can always think of a chapter in a book, so this is unnecessary!!\n「...I won’t cancel the engagement」\nDeclaring this clearly, Wolf finally unravelled his fingers from my wrist.\nBut before completely letting go, he stroked my wrist with his finger, taking care of the spot that was constrained before.\nEver since a while ago, I didn’t have any resistance to Wolf’s actions, and now my face was boiling red like an octopus. No matter what I said, it wouldn’t fit my current condition.\nWhen Wolf stood up and said『Let’s return to our rooms』, I could only nod my head several times. At any rate, I feel that once I’m alone, I can calm down.\n「Good night, fiancee-dono. Have a pleasant dream」\nThat’s why, I couldn’t complain when Wolf, after sending me to guest room, kissed me near the eye (possibly on top of the beauty mark under my eye) just before he left. (3)\nI would say that the fiancé that my parent chose for me, was a yandere.\nHowever, he was a person that was considerably difficult to hate.\n(1)\nAuthor wrote it as: My father has been in high spirits since the news arrived.\nSince there wasn’t any mention of other news, I assume it’s talking about the last chapter.\n(2)\nForgetful-dreamer:\nI don’t know whether it was on purpose or not, but in the previous paragraph, her father said that “a capable person that could make such judgment (眼鏡) doesn’t exist”. But in this paragraph, the wording for “his approval” (父の眼鏡”: literally father’s glasses judgement) was talking about judgment – so her father was probably aware that he wasn’t capable person to judge and that’s why he’s betting? I’m confused. Author-san needs to make it easier to understand for stupid me...\nMidori:\nI have my own interpretation of this, but it should be somewhere near to what the author had in mind. For the ‘capable person that could make such a judgement doesn’t exist’, it refers to the earlier part. Whether Licorice marrying into another family, or her marrying her own relative, is a ‘safer’ option. Her father is saying that there’s no one who’d be able to know for sure which one’s better.\nThe second part of the approval would refer to the father’s judgement of Wolf. From the father’s perspective, Wolf is a worthy person, and is fitting to be married to Licorice(something like that), so the children of Licorice and Wolf should be children of ability and skill, therefore, his plan of having two grandsons to lead both families would work with Wolf as the partner.\n(3)\nI’ll be using it interchangeably with mole under the eye.\nPlease give your appreciation to midoriha “Midori” for the fast PR. The following chapters might be a bit slow, since I don’t have any other drafts that are completed yet.",

      "content": "The next day, my father and I departed from the dukedom of Ranuncula.\nWith that, somehow or other, I became pen-pals with Wolf.\nAt first, letters came in early every day, but after lecturing him that letters and diaries were different things, the frequency decreased to only twice a week. It was worthwhile reading the thick letters he sent, and I undauntedly sent my own letters talking about various things back to him.\nSpeaking of which.\nFor some reason, a letter from Duke Ranuncula came.\nThe contents of which were all about Wolf, about how recently he’s become more mature, and that it was all thanks to me. It looked like he was very happy while writing the letter. A really cute prime minister-sama.\nThat being the case, the meeting with my fiance ended, entirely and unexpectedly, peaceful. Blades, blood, pain, or even violence, were not brought up in my encounter.\nFor the time being, it was the feeling of having weathered the storm.\nBut. Having said that.\nDid I really escape the threat of a Yandere?\nLet’s think back one by one.\nFirst, about Wolf. My fiancé, thankfully, didn’t suffer from any mental illness. When I first met him, he had an unyielding personality, but I think he also has a cute side now.\nSince Duke Ranuncula was a man of character as well, their blood relationship as father and son was apparent. I think that was the most important thing.\nAnyway, I couldn’t see how this would be a problem.\nNext, is about me. Suddenly remembering a lot of things caused me confusion, but in the end, I’m still me. Meeting Wolf also didn’t change me.\nRight now, I have memories of the game’s death ending for Lycoris, and I plan to avoid that at all cost. Becoming a yandere, will probably not happen.\nThe next issue would probably be... the other game characters aside from me and Wolf.\nWhat I mean to say is, I wonder what life the other characters are living at the present. It would be good if I can find out.\nIn truth, other than Wolf, I can’t remember any details about the other capturable characters.\nAfter all, 『Past life!?』,『Yandere Game!?』,『Engagement!?』 had me confused, since I’ve only been trying to remember things about『Wolfgang Eisenhut』in the meantime, I had left the other characters details aside and wanted to think about them later.\nNow that I could pause and think about the other characters, I had considerably little information about them.\nTo start with, there were four capturable characters, including Wolf. That was for certain.\nEach of their image colors, excluding Wolfgang’s black, was red, yellow, and white.\nSo far, so good.\nThen, when I began thinking about the characters’ faces, they were blurred beyond recognition.\nBarely making out the name, the red character was 『Shade』. Having showed up in a lot of endings with Wolfgang, I think that he was treated as a『peerless』character, but I couldn’t remember what kind of routes he had. His hair color was brown. But, because of his image color being red, it was probably reddish-brown, to be more precise.\nThe yellow character, was a bright blonde. The white character was an exotic black-haired beauty....I think. Most likely.\nConsidering this, it’s highly probable that, in order for me to remember the game’s content, I would probably need a trigger.\nHaving suffered from doubt since infancy, it was only the introduction of Wolfgang Eisenhut that erased it. In the same way, in order to recall the bizarre thing that is the『memories of my previous life』, I needed to have something to start with.\nIf it’s like that, as long as I don’t encounter the remaining characters, I won’t recall them.\nSince all the capturable characters supposedly had high social standings, I initially thought that I could somehow make contact with them. Although there was no way to find out about the yellow and white characters, since I was able to recall the name 『Shade』, I wanted to investigate.\nThe result was — there was no one by that name.\nEven if I couldn’t find out by trying to investigate now, there was one reliable method.\nIt was best to wait for the time to come.\nThe stage would be the game’s royal magic school. The children from the nobility who can wield magic assemble there, and it was the oldest school in the history of the kingdom.\nAfter about two years, when we turn twelve years of age, both Wolf and I will be attending that school. So, if you wait one or two years, with the exception of the heroine, all the characters will meet face-to-face.\nSpeaking of which, the game heroine will only appear to me and Wolf six years later, when she enters the school through special admission.\n（Well... in the first place, there is no guarantee that all the game characters will be there... I do wonder what what will happen, but it’s nothing to worry about.）\nHaving those happy-go-lucky thoughts, I was considerably hasty, and was simply an idiot.\nAt that time, I had wanted to just pass through the toughest part.\nAs a future warning as well, I have to etch these words to my chest.\nA Yandere– will appear— when you least expect them to.\nIntending to upload this on the weekend, but Midori is too fast at PR work.",

      "content": "As luck would have it, the omen slipped into tranquility.\nIt had been three months of correspondence with both my fiance and his father, and around that time, I became troubled about the storage location of my received letters.\nMy letter had a wish for consultation from Wolf.\nThis is because Wolf is currently faced with a very difficult problem.\nThere were talks of Duke Ranuncula taking in a second wife.\nThe duke’s wife, that is to say, Wolf’s mother, died four years ago. During that time, these talks wouldn’t go through. There was one particular audacious lady, who since four years ago, had not been seen giving up at all.\nThe duke said 『Having a second wife at this age is too late』 and so he never had another person, but personally, I think he underestimated himself too much. Leaving his position as prime minister aside, if it’s that person, it wouldn’t be strange for any woman to say『I want to look after you...』.\nIn any case, four years had already passed since that time, and Wolf’s engagement was officially announced. By the way, this was just from one week ago. If it’s among children, an official ceremony for the decided engagement isn’t done. I was only told to nod my head to the duke, then to my father.\nAt any rate, it was then that they began sinking their teeth in for a second time. The relatives began whispering things like「Think, now that your son is getting married. You’ll be lonely without a second wife in your old age」which seemed to upset the duke.\nThese kinds of issues, in truth, even I have it at my home. In our house there was only my father and me, and no doubt presently, there are these hardships. In my family’s case, since there was no apparent heir, the fight of being the second wife was even fiercer.\nThere was only one single warning that came from me. Save for a woman that my father personally introduced to me, I absolutely won’t allow those sort of women to step foot into our house.\nThese people existed in the aristocracy.\nThe methods they used to show that they could become good mothers was something that I disliked. For example, taking their own servants and placing them into the household. I’ve also heard that they forced things like clothes, jewelry, horses, dogs, and cats, as much as their circumstances allowed.\nAlthough it would be over once the latter was refused and sent back, the former was worrisome. By taking action, that means the person was capable of doing unreasonable things.\nThat was what I put together in writing and sent back to Wolf, and the response was this.\n『There was a lady who came into the house when my father wasn’t around, alone』\nThat even now, she doesn’t understand the refusal for her visits, or rather than doesn’t, it was more of, she doesn’t want to understand them, was what he replied back.\nIt seems that woman has always liked Duke Ranuncula for a long time. She was a woman who continued to think of the duke even after he first married, and she insisted to Wolf that she couldn’t bear being away from his father.\nDo you think it would go well? With that question he asked, somehow I replied to him that it might, with great effort. It was really sweet of him.\nHearing my friend trying his best, I also could not sit still.\n『Even if she’s not related by blood, the most important thing is that you become a good family. That’s why, good luck. I’m cheering you on』\nAfter composing that letter to my close friend, I sent it to him.\nLater on, I would regret those irresponsible words from the bottom of my heart.\n—\nOn a clear sunny day.\nA letter came in from Wolf,and it was completely different from usual.\nWith an adequate envelope and stationary, there were only short sentences.\n『Tomorrow is father’s birthday. The same lady will be preparing the feast for dinner. Since father will be late from work, it’s embarrassing to start the conversation. It might be a bit sudden, but won’t you come? I also want you to meet her. If you come, then we could think of words to praise whatever cooking she makes together. I’ll come pick you up』\nIt was a pretty hasty request.\nBased on the date, the『tomorrow』in the letter, meant that it was referring to today. But if I depart by noon, I might still make it for dinner.\nHe probably only wrote this much yesterday because he was in a hurry.\nIt appears like he was so nervous that he couldn’t calm down.\nAlthough I was not socially capable of striking a conversation on our first meeting, it would be more comfortable for her to be with a woman. Above all, it would be better to have two people with her instead of one. Somehow, I wanted to try cooperating.\nUnexpectedly, my father easily gave me his consent. In fact, Duke Ranuncula asked my father to come, arranging his presence for dinner as well.\nIt might be because of distrust, but the duke didn’t want any third party to know about the second wife candidate’s presence at the dinner. Socially, my father was considered as part of their family now.\nWolf having wrote『I’ll come pick you up』with a polite demeanor like a gentlemen in the prime of his life, sent over the Ranuncula house’s butler. Moreover with an escort.\nDeparting separately from my father’s preparation to go with the duke, I prepared as much as I could before leaving the house early.\nFor that reason, I expected to arrive at the duke’s house earlier.\nI felt exhilarated.\nAfter three months, it was a good opportunity to see him so I could confirm if he really had an unexpected growth spurt like he said. If he, who was previously shorter than me of the same age, were to grew exceptionally, I wouldn’t be able to tease him anymore.\nThe day was still early, I hope I’ll have time to spare before dinner. Then just like he said,『think of words to praise whatever cooking she makes 』, we would be able to think of them together.\nOf course, I’ve already decided the best words to describe a heartfelt compliment about delicious food.\n（In truth, it would be traumatic for the person cooking if their food causes food poisoning...）\nThat was when I had the thought.\nMy head was filled with information.\nIt was the second time I felt it in my life.\nI received awareness after the shock receded.\nFrozen solid, I heard an unpleasant sound.\nAlthough I thought that, it was actually the sound of my teeth chattering.\nBecause of the shivering of my quivering body, no strength entered it, when the carriage merely shook I fell down from my seat.\nNot caring about it, with the sound of warning bells in my head, I was able to regain some strength and hit the carriage door.\n「What’s wrong!? My lady!」\n「W-Where is this place? No, I mean. How long until we arrive at Duke Ranuncula’s residence?」\nEven with the abnormal situation I was in, sitting on the floor with a pale face, he still responded「We’ll be there shortly」.\n「Please, as much as we can, hurry. Please. Ple-.... It’s okay even if it shakes! I need to arrive as early as possible!」\nHaving lost his bearing, with me clinging to him with a menacing look, he could only nod back.\nAs the carriage started again, I gripped the seat from my place at the floor.\nI remembered.\nWolfgang Eisenhut, from the game, was a misogynist. But it wasn’t like that when he was born.\nThe reason why he got messed up, was because of an incident.\nThe word that triggered my memories was『Food Poisoning』. No, rather, it was the word『Poison』.\nWolf told the game heroine, that in his childhood, he was served poison by a certain woman. On his father’s birthday, he thought that woman would become his new mother.\nAfter somehow escaping from the edge of death because of a young body, what met him, by a forced double suicide, was the cold corpse of his father.\nThanks to Technicolordiscode for helping give me a second opiniom on this.\nAnd same goes to midori for PR again.",

      "content": "When she — the candidate to be Duke Ranuncula’s second wife, Robinia, heard from Wolf that the number of dinner guests would increase, she said「Okay」. Appearing to be smiling, as she nodded.\nWith the excuse of practicing her cooking, she confined herself to the kitchen early. That was why, in the evening, she already called Wolf over to the kitchen.\nHolding out a small saucer of soup, she offered Wolf a taste.\nIt was at that exact moment, that I rushed into the kitchen of the Ranuncula residence.\n「Wolf!」\nCalling out as loud as I could, Wolf’s head quickly turned my way.\n「Lycoris, what’s wrong? Did something happen?」\nRunning all the way here as fast as possible, I voiced the word 「Doctor」 to Wolf .\n「I don’t feel well, would you call the doctor for me? Please.」\nBecause I had sprinted all the way here, my breathing was suspicious, so Wolf panicked.\n「Robinia, this girl is Lycoris. I’ll leave her in your care for a while.」\nOnly saying that much, hurried footsteps made their way out of the kitchen.\nAnd so, I faced the woman who was standing still in front of the pot of soup.\nRobinia was, from head to toe, a slender and fair-skinned woman. She looked younger than I imagined, it was hard to believe that she was already in her late thirties.\nThe aura she had looked like nothing but a fleeting innocence.\n「Nice to meet you, my name is Lycoris Radiata.」\nMy voice was impatient, curt. From the beginning, I had no plans to make small talk with her. I only wanted to confirm one thing. If this was all a mistake on my part, then I will happily try all I can to make amends with her.\n「Pardon my rudeness, but may I know whether you’ve tasted the soup?」\n「...」\n「If you haven’t, I would suggest you try it out first」\nBringing out a new saucer, and innocently adding a silver spoon as I said so... I then offered it to her. (1)\n「Even me, when I try to cook, there are times that I would unbelievably fail at it. For example, accidentally putting sugar instead of salt. That’s why-」\n「How did you find out?」\nI wasn’t able to finish my sentence as she cut off my words with a flat tone. My face quickly turned white.\n「I wonder how you found out. How strange.」\nThe woman’s eyes certainly reflected that of a killer.\nAdding poison to her own cooking, and confidently making people eat it. In that matter, without defending herself on her attempt at murder by poisoning, I can’t think that her behaviour would indicate she’d try to escape.\nShe stared at the poisoned soup that she had made, looking like a child at a loss.\nAnd then.\n「...How mean. Now the soup has gone to waste.」\nShe murmured with a voice that sounded to be in deep sorrow. (2)\n「... Even I, at first, thought I could be a good mother. But, you always had a displeased face, and you never once called me “Mother”.」\nWhen she said 『You』, she looked in the direction of the doorway, where Wolf stood, with all color drained from his face.\n「And then I realized, for the Duke and I to have a new life, I couldn’t stand having someone else in this house after all. With a clean slate, I wanted to build a wonderful family with the Prime Minister-sama. The second wife’s children, it’s common that they’ll get bullied by the first wife’s children. If I give birth to my cute baby, what could I do if you bullied that child? What’s more...」\nShe sent a resentful look towards Wolf.\nInnocently muttering those blunt complaints to a child, seeing that sent a dreadful chill down my spine.\n「That’s why, in order to kill the nuisance, I got this. I don’t know whether it was handy, but when I put the poison in my purse, the feeling I had was really dreadful」\nShe placed a small vial on top of the table with a clink. As expected, she really didn’t plan on hiding what she’d done.\nRobinia was a psychopath. At least, I could only think of her as nothing but one.\nAt any rate, I had to pull Wolf away from this terrible woman.\nStarting from the butler who looked like he was bringing in the medicated bath for me, people started coming into the kitchen.\nFacing the perplexed bystanders,「I’m not the one at fault,」she continued on saying,「Because, I only did this so that I would be the only one the Duke would love.」\nMoving my two trembling feet, I approached Wolf. I tried pulling Wolf away by the black clothes he was wearing, but he continued to devour Robinia with his eyes, dumbfounded. So at the very least, with my two hands, I blocked Wolf’s ears.\nWith that, his violet eyes turned to me. A distorted crying face of a child was reflected in his eyes. My face.\nI was incredibly relieved that Wolf was okay, and dreadfully, dreadfully angry at Robinia.\nAt that time, I felt a lot of conflicting feelings. I was unable to bear the heavy feeling in my chest, and as a ten-year-old child, all I did was gulp uncontrollably, unable to do any reasonable action.\nSoon after, I let out a loud wail as I cried my heart out.\nActually, when I thought about it, the person who should be crying right now was Wolf, but I only realized it later that night.\nWe left everything about the dinner to the Duke and my father after they returned. Meanwhile, we just sat down in Wolf’s room, cuddled together with the lights turned on. Although both my hands held the book open, not even once could the sound of the page being flipped be heard.\nOnly for today, even if the adults ask us to sleep alone or to turn off the lights, we won’t obey.\nI closed the book with a plop, then turned to face Wolf.\n「Go ahead and cry」was what I said.\n「I’m fine」was what he returned.\nThinking that there was no way he could be fine, I pressed a wet towel to his face so he could cool his eyes.\nHowever, Wolf quickly took it from my hands, pushing it back to my still swollen eyes.\n「You’ve already cried this much. This is more than enough.」\nSaying those illogical words, his gentle voice sounded like he was pampering me.\nMy eyes started to swell up once again, and the wet towel became even wetter.\nI suddenly recalled the letter that Duke Ranuncula wrote.\nWolf has become mature. It might be just as the Duke said. I wonder if it’s because he’s becoming mature that he could overcome such a painful event. And with such an amazing speed.\n「...At this rate, Wolf will surely end up becoming a woman hater.」\nWith my unexpected words, it seemed he thought it was a joke.\nLaughing like it entertained him, he suddenly stood up and looked down at me.\n「Because that’s all you’ve been thinking of, you’ve been sitting inside a man’s room in the middle of the night, crying defenselessly. You have to sense at least an ounce of danger, or else a man’s honor might get questioned.」\nAfter he said it, with a jerk of his arm, thinking that he was pulling me up to my feet, Wolf instead lifted my body.\nThis posture is what you would call carrying a girl “princess style”.\nWith a blank look and my mouth wide open, looking like a fool, I was surprised. Although I was shocked about Wolf’s strength, but more than that...\n「Could it be, Wolf – did you really grow taller than me?」\n「... You didn’t believe me?」\n「That’s not what I... but, it’s only been three months.」\n「I’ve been struggling to become mature. Along with my body. And my mind, too.」\nWith him laughing embarrassedly, to me, he seemed mature enough – he looked strong.\nNow it was clear to me.\nHe was really becoming mature.\nAnd maybe.\nHe is becoming different from the one I knew in the game, a new『Wolfgang Eisenhut』was being formed.\nNote:\n(1)\nSilver reacts to some elements of poison.\n(2)\nI’m guessing she tried to drink it. Crazy woman...\n—\nOne more chapter to go before the end of this arc. How are you all feeling about this story? Happy? Sad?\nAt this point, I’m planning to translate the next arc as well. I’m reading through the new arc, but I’m a bit stuck... Anyone know of a flower term that sounds like Rankuratsu? Or any German name in particular?\nAt this moment, I’m using Rankgerüste(trellis/flowering fences in English). But it might not be the right name.",

      "content": "「Today we’ll be cooking」\nSuddenly saying that and shoving a cloth at me, was my fiancée — Lycoris Radiata. Recently, her visits were relatively frequent that such visits didn’t surprise me anymore.\nOn our first meeting, she greatly angered me; in some respects, her only attractive features were her slanted eyes and the mole under her eye. Although her mature appearance might be attributed to the fact that as a ten year old girl she was fairly tall, now it was clear that it was her mind which surpassed her height in displaying that maturity.\nWhen the girl in question came into my line of sight, my eyebrows knitted together.\nThe reason for this was because her usual loose wavy black hair was inelegantly tied with a string and a crooked triangular piece of cloth covered her forehead. The rouge dress that suited her well, was hidden from view by a thick white apron.\nHer outfit was an imitation based on the maids that wore apron dresses and white headbands to work (although, I don’t know what they’re officially called).\n「You know, no one wanted to lend me an apron dress」\n「That’s obvious」\nNoticing my dubious look, she pouted. I could just imagine the bewilderment of the people in the house if they find out that the duke’s daughter was running around in servant’s clothing.\n「But I was able to somehow find a clean cloth to work with. Ah, don’t worry though. The cloth you’re holding is something I properly borrowed from mister butler」\nRight before she pointed out that fact. I was unfurling the cloth that she passed to me. Attached to a rectangular fabric by a string was a very simple vest. The rectangular fabric would probably be wrapped to the lower body as an apron, but what was the need for the vest?\n「It’s exactly black」\nShe, in some way, proudly declared this fact.\n「I’ll be standing in the kitchen wearing this?」\n「There’s nothing wrong with that. Duke Ranuncula gave us his utmost support. And it won’t hurt if a man can cook. Besides, once we’re twelve we won’t be able to do this in the school dorms」\nAlthough my father indulged her by consenting, this was really illogical.\n「We’d probably have a cook in the dorms...」\nBut my complaint went in Lycoris’s one ear and out the other as she wrapped the waist-cloth around my waist and dressing me in the vest atop my shirt. Even though I had planned to properly scold her about the distance being too close, I always wavered.\nAt least before the chances of coming into contact with other men increased while entering the school and debuting in high society, I had to rectify her defenselessness.\nNot knowing my complex inner thoughts, Lycoris muttered「Garçon style~ cute~」.(1) I don’t understand the first part, but calling a man of an impressionable age 『Cute』was definitely taboo. Truly, I want you to stop calling me that from the bottom of my heart. But I didn’t want her to think of me as a narrow-minded man.\nBeing rebellious by desperately cutting down on being called cute was not my intention, but I continued to get dragged by the arm into the kitchen.\n「Today, the challenge is to make 『porridge』」\n「What the heck is it?」\n「It’s a bit difficult to explain what it tastes like. It would be simpler to just make it」\nAnd so, the sudden cooking course started.\nI began by carefully washing my hands, proceeding to wash the vegetables, and some unfamiliar grains right after, then chopping the vegetables and adding all of the ingredients together into a pot.\nWhen I noticed that the ingredients being chopped were very sour and weak in substance,「Are these also going to be added in?」, was what I asked, and「These are incredibly important ingredients that cannot be missed out」was what she replied. Somehow, today had me completely following her pace, I hope that I don’t end up with anything I’m not satisfied with.\nAfter finishing the cooking of the so called『porridge』, I cautiously scooped a bit of the sour ingredients I hated into a small saucer.\n「Wait!」\nDue to the panic in her voice, my hand stopped.\n「I’ll be tasting it first. It’s mortifying if it has a weird taste after it was done」\nHer point was illogical.\nAlthough she was the one guiding, the one who did the cooking was me. Even if the outcome of the cooking had a weird taste, there wouldn’t be any reason for her to feel ashamed.\nFinally, her intention became clear. Well, it was kind of expected though.\nAfter the incident of almost getting served poison, the people around me began preparing my meals with care. The servants in charge of the kitchen would offer to personally taste-test the meal for poison; furthermore, soup was no longer added to the table.\nI told them I was fine even if they didn’t do it, but no one listened.\nThe food I consumed didn’t decrease.\nHowever, it was a pathetic to say that I felt melancholic every dinner time. It seemed she realized this small disorder I had.\n「...Ok. It’s pretty good」\nShe said this after taste-testing it for poison for me, after quickly washing it, she offered the small saucer.\n「Do you... want to have a taste as well?」\n(Forcing me to make the dish, then making that anxious face, isn’t this cheating?)\nEven with a small height difference, having Lycoris send me an upward glance in a helpless state stirred something within me. Wanting to cherish her, and at the same time wanting to tease her – it was an extremely complicated feeling.\n「Yeah, let me have a taste」\nHaving said that, I opened my mouth slightly, and sure enough, she was put in an embarrassing situation.\nBut eventually, a small portion of the『porridge』in the small saucer slowly came closer to my mouth.\nWith moderate amount of sourness inside my mouth, the natural sweetness of the cereal spread through.\nNot bad.\nWith the sound of a gulp from my throat, I remembered my hunger.\nNo matter how meddlesome it is, this was the deep affection of my fiancée.\n『As long as it’s your hand that offers, even if it was poison I’ll gladly take it』or so the lines of a play I heard somewhere before, drifted into my head.\nIf I said those words out loud though, I’ll surely get scolded for indiscretion.\n—\n(1) Garçon – actually French Waiter style\nAuthor-san likes teaching us a lot of new words.",

      "content": "For the time being, looking through a list Father obtained of people who possessed magical qualities in this generation, had become my daily work.\nProduced by the magical association, you could say this list, as it is now, was an estimated list of people who would be able to get into the royal magical academy.\nHowever, there were some exceptions. The game heroine’s name was not in here. Her case was certainly an exception, since she was a person that was admitted midway; At present, her magical abilities would not have been recognized yet.\nAmong the group of names on the list, I would mark down some of names with a circle. From those of the five dukedoms and its branches, I selected the children of these notable aristocrats.\n‘Wouldn’t people with high social status have higher chances of being the capturable characters?’, was my expectation as I selected these names. For those potentially high social-class people in particular, I marked down with a double circle.\nHowever, this wasn’t a sure hit.\n(How should I say it, I wanted a group photo shot similar to how the Japanese take it)\nThat time when I remembered Wolf from the game, I had the liberty of getting his full name and portrait. However, I got this list by telling my father that『I want to know a little bit about the other people who will be attending the magical school with me...』, if I tell him 『While you’re at it, I also want a portrait of each and every one of them...』, it might put him off.\nOr perhaps, rather than being a problem, it was impossible. Pictures only became prevalent in modern day Japan.\nBy the way, the name『Shade』wasn’t in this list.\nIt was possible that the name was a nickname derived from his real name, as I couldn’t find even a trace of him.\nLearning that falling behind on the situation was terrifying, one way or the other, I desperately tried to do everything I could. However, I made little progress.\nBecause of the inspiration I gained, after staking everything on the list and the countless of times looking over it, I became familiar with the names on it.\n(Since it’s capturable characters from the game, I’m sure the common feature all of them have will be that they’re all good-looking)\nI wonder if I there was a chance I could obtain any rumour about a good-looking guy that could narrow down my search. The chances of that ought to be slim. The moment I request this from my father, my credibility with him will drop, and I won’t be able to fix it without doing something drastic. But if I can succeed with that chance, I was willing to try it...\nInterrupting my destructive thoughts half-way, my nanny called me over after lunch preparations were completed.\n「...Will my father be joining today?」\n「Yes. He is waiting together with a guest.」\n「There’s a guest?」\nHow disappointing.\n「Yes, it’s your relative. The madame’s younger brother. Does my lady remember him?」\n「It’s Uncle Narcissus, right? I wasn’t informed that he’ll be joining us today」\n「That’s correct. The conversation was a sudden one. He wanted to have a consultation with the Master no matter what」\nI didn’t know whether this starting point was a good one or a bad one. It was rare for me to attend lunch with numerous people.\n「Good day, Uncle. It’s been awhile since I last spoke with you. I’m Lycoris」\nI said it with a ladylike manner. For a short while, my uncle had a convincing look of surprise on his face. He was a little slow.\n「Lycoris! My, how a child could change, in just a short time of not seeing her. You’re becoming so much like my older sister.」\nTelling me that I was similar to my mother, truthfully, made me a little lost for words. After all, with only her portrait, I didn’t know much about the other person.\n「Are Aunt and Crinum also well? 」\nCrinum was a cousin a year older than me. Although we exchange letters often, in truth, it’s been awhile since we’ve seen each other.\n「Yes. Yes. They’re both fine. But Lycoris – how old have you become?」\n「I’m ten years old.」\n「I see, I see. At any rate, you look grown up. I wonder if this is what kids are like nowadays. Although that child is younger than you, that kid is considerably–」\n「Narcissus.」\nFather cut off Uncle’s monologue.\nHearing Father use a slightly hard tone unusual for him, I was surprised.\n「Save that talk for later. I don’t want Lycoris to be involved in that discussion」\n「Come now. It should be fine, Kaffir. In any case, she’ll find out sooner or later. I don’t mind.」\nKaffir is my father’s name. No one in the house calls him by that name, so hearing it used was a bit out of the ordinary.\nNevertheless, why did father say that he didn’t want me to hear『that talk』? It’s been known for a long time that Uncle goes slightly off topic.\nProceeding with a wrong guess, I wanted to try satisfying my curiosity.\n「Uncle. Who do you mean by『that child』? From what I know, Crinum is a year older than me」\n「That’s right, it’s not about Crinum, I’m talking about another cousin of yours. That kid... is a child that I had out of wedlock...」\nThe instant he said something incredibly unexpected, I turned to face my father. I wonder if Father understood the feeling I was facing. He sent a somewhat troubled-looking smile back to me.\n「Recently, I’ve taken that kid home. That kid is a boy. His name is Shade」\n――――――――――――――――eh?",

      "content": "「U-uncle! I want to meet that cousin of mine!」\nThe instant those words left my mouth, Uncle made a happy-looking broad smile, while Father made a bitter one.\n「Lycoris, come here for a moment」\nI obeyed father and walked up to him, what met me was his slightly rigid face.\n「Lycoris. You shouldn’t thrust your neck into another person’s circumstances too much」\n「But Father, this is my cousin we’re talking about. Aren’t you also curious about what kind of child he is?」\n「That might be true... but, as far as your aunt is concerned, she especially doesn’t want outsiders to know about this. Do you understand?」\n「That’s... Yes. I understand」\n「Then be a good girl and take care of the house, okay?」\nFather was planning to go with Uncle, that much I gathered.\nThe discussion with Uncle was no doubt about the child that was brought in. Thus, Father was coming along in order to check the current situation.\nFather’s point may be valid, but since I knew nothing more about『Shade』other than the child’s name, I couldn’t remain passive.\n「Father...」\nAt loss without a good excuse, trying to stop him, I held on to the cuff of my father’s shirt as he said 『This discussion is over』.\nSeeing this, my father frowned.\n「...You... want to meet him that much?」\n「Y-yes. It’s fine even if you only bring me to greet him. I won’t say anything unnecessary, that’s why, Father, please...」\nMy father heaved out a sigh.\nMy uncle, Narcissus Rankgerüste, together with his wife and daughter, lived thirty minutes away from the Lilia household via horse carriage. (1)\nOfficially, his job was to govern the different territories in the vast dukedom of Lilia, to ease up the dominion. My father didn’t have any brothers or sisters, so Uncle Narcissus, his brother-in-law, took on this responsibility.\nBut having said that, his post was actually upon my father’s personal instruction – the arrangement of the multiple jobs related to the dealing of those under my father’s jurisdiction, were taken care of by the person appointed as the magistrate. So, the kind of work my uncle was actually doing? That was probably something a child should not hear about.\nBy the way, it looks like Uncle’s hobby was gardening. Apparently, inside the Rankgerüste premises, lies a wonderful greenhouse.\nAnd it also seems that due to his work, my uncle almost never opens it when he’s at home, but he went far and wide in order to procure the plants for cultivation. U~huh.\nAlthough I kept nodding my head to whatever my uncle was saying, my mind was preoccupied with the constant hope (or should I say, worry) that I might not get to meet with 『Shade』.\n「Where is that child?」\nWithout any pretense, Uncle Narcissus inquired the head butler as soon as we arrived at the mansion. And in a well-informed manner, the butler quickly returned an answer.\n「He is together with Miss Crinum」\nI was looking forward to seeing my one-year older cousin, Crinum. And of course, I won’t leave her be if she’s distressed right now.\nEven though we were generally cousins, Crinum and I aren’t so similar. She is a beautiful lady with straight brown hair, and a neat and tidy appearance. Her personality was what you might say quiet and shy. When the family members met for a gathering, as the only one younger than her, she hid behind my shoulders.\nBeing close relatives, as well as having our houses close to each other, we became pretty good friends. Although I did say that we corresponded primarily with letters, we united together as fellow bookworms.\nShade’s origin might be an illegitimate child, but he was able to take Uncle Narcissus’s affections, and was also getting along well with Crinum. It’s curious what Aunt’s stance on this was, but with two allies on his side, I think this place would not be as terrible as it could be for him.\nWith that expectation in mind, I boldly stepped inside the Rankgerüste residence.\nBut.\nRemaining in the guest room, my father and I continued to wait. However, none of Uncle’s family members showed up.\n「Father. Are you okay leaving work aside for today? 」\n「Yeah. From the beginning, I accepted that most of my time today will be spent here if I came along. As Narcissus’s brother-in-law, and especially since I’m the eldest in our family, I can’t think of it as just someone else’s affairs」\n「That’s true... Father, have you already met that child before?」\n「No. Not yet. I had just heard that they’ve been searching all over for that child’s mother. It was only yesterday that they found something about her」\n「Eh? Then, does that mean that child was only taken in just yesterday?」\n「No. Some time has already passed since he was taken in. It’s because I wasn’t concerned about my younger brother that I noticed this too late」\nIn other words, there were no reports made before my father became aware of this situation. My uncle had decided on his own to take in the child, and was able to keep it a secret, even from my father. It might be rude of me to say this— but that was amazing.\n「Uncle is surprisingly a man of action, huh?」\n「Well- ...yeah, he is」\nAfter Father said it, he hesitated a bit. How rare.\n「To tell you the truth, his way of thinking is something that cannot quite be understood. He used to be my second cousin, so we had an old relationship. But even in the old days, I felt that we had a different pace. If anything, I missed those days. Although it is inexcusable for me to say this, I didn’t have to have a really friendly relationship with him」\nFather confessed his socializing problems(?). That was even more rare.\n「I see, I guess even you, Father, have people you don’t understand and get puzzled over, huh...」\nFather looked to be taken aback by my words, and subsequently gave me a wry laugh.\n「You’re right. In the first place, I――」\n「Kaffir! Sorry to have kept you waiting!」\nThere was one more thing I learned about Uncle. This person – had incredibly bad timing. (2)\n(1) I stuck with this name, the German word is translated as trellis or a flower fence. The reason I had, was that it’s like saying they’re supporting characters. And greenhouse, which is Narcissus’s pastime, would have flower fences, right? RIGHT??? OTL\n(2) I’m taking the literal approach of the Japanese translation. 間(TIMING)が(IS)悪い(BAD)[間が悪い]. Actual translation is unlucky/unfortunate, but unless Kaffir gave him a sucker punch or something for interrupting, it wouldn’t fit.",

      "content": "When Uncle came in, it was my cousin, Crinum who accompanied him. For some reason, it was only her.\n「Kaffir... Actually, my wife doesn’t want to come out of her room. Would you be so kind as to help me pacify her?」\nSaying it rather miserably, Uncle asked Father to come along with him.\nBefore leaving us behind, we both exchanged strained smiles.\n「Good day, Crinum. It’s been a while」\n「Yes, Lycoris. Thanks for always sending letters」\nAfter greeting each other with a smile, I was amazed by her change.\nShe had grown taller with a curvy, womanly figure. But I didn’t mean that she was fat, her waist and limbs were still as slender as before. Although dark freckles might considerably cover her unusually white skin, I dare say, it would likely fade away in a few years time. And though she likely put on perfume in her hair, it had a fragrant smell.\nI don’t know whether it was because she’s been living together with Uncle, but since the day I met her until now, she was far more mature than I was. Perhaps, it was because of age.\n「Crinum, during the time we didn’t meet, you grew even prettier」\n「Eh?」\n「You were already a beautiful girl to begin with, but now you’ve gotten closer to becoming a beautiful woman」\n「You praise me too much, Lycoris. You’ve grown considerably as well. You’ve always been conscious of your almond-shaped eyes for a long time, but that child-like roundness stands out from your features. You’ve become an incredible beauty in my opinion」\nSince it was Crinum who was evidently saying all that, most likely, my face turned bright red.\nWhile that was going on, Father came in escorting Aunt. How should I put it – as expected of Father’s skills, that was extremely fast.\nCrinum and Aunt, when they were standing next to each other, were really a spitting image of each other.\n「Hello, Lycoris. Thanks for worrying about Crinum and coming today」\nHaving Aunt give a slightly weak-looking smile, I could only return a「No, it’s nothing much」as I thought of how unforgivable my true intentions were.\n『She was worried about Crinum~』was probably the explanation Father gave to her. Although I was worried for Crinum, in truth, the reason I came to this place was mostly so that I could meet『Shade』.\nTimes like this when I rush on madly towards one matter, I might forget to consider other people’s feelings. I shall reflect on this.\nNow then, what has happened to 『Shade』?\nEven at that time, when we took our seats for dinner, he has yet to show his face .\nThe reason he hasn’t shown for dinner, as Aunt explained, was:\n「He hasn’t learned etiquette yet. That’s why he can’t come out and taken the seat」\nWell, I think that might be highly probable. Dinner etiquette was demanded in the aristocracy; I’d say, if it wasn’t obviously beaten into my head at a young age, it would be doubtful for me to comprehend the intricate gestures required during mealtime.\nHaving said that, in Aunt’s words, were a biting sense of coldness as expected. Even considering that Aunt was reluctant to let it out in front of us, the thought of having a stepson should be a complicated affair. That was only natural, though.\nDirecting to me, Uncle said.\n「That’s right, Lycoris. If you don’t mind, why don’t you teach manners to that child? He’s a slightly shy kid, but he might trust you who is of the same age」\nIf Uncle believed a『shy kid』would lower his guard to a female relative who appeared out of nowhere, then that would be considerably “positive thinking” in my opinion. Everything won’t suddenly work out just because we are of the same age. I didn’t voice that out though.\nCrinum was very quiet throughout dinner. Honestly speaking, I had been curious about what Crinum thought of her little brother, but asking her directly is, as expected, not possible.\nAnd so, after dinner.\nFinally, Uncle led both Father and I to 『Shade』 and met him face-to-face .\nShade was an adorable, seemingly angelic child.\nPeculiar gold-brown hair framed his soft cheeks, his eyes were a deep brown... was what I thought, but when I looked closer, his eyes had more of a reddish tinge than brown.\nHis skin looked transparently white, and his cheeks were rosy red. I seriously didn’t think a day would come that I would\never describe a boy like him\nHowever, his body was considerably and delicately thin.\nThinking of a guy that was around the same age as him, Wolf came to mind. Although since Wolf rapidly became buff recently, he probably wouldn’t be a suitable target of comparison. But, even then Shade was really thin. I wonder if he was malnourished as a child.\n「This child is Shade. Shade Rankgerüste」\nIn response to Uncle’s words, as usual, my head was filled with information.\nShade. In the game, he had been in the same magical school as the heroine for five years. In other words he had been sixteen years old. The current him had no resemblance to his older self; his masculine appearance floated in my mind. In the game, his still-pictures had lively, or otherwise charming smiles on it.\nContrary to Wolf who had hated women, Shade had been a character who loved them. However, there was a problem with his love for women. He actively pursued women by happily giving out sweet words — then blatantly leaving them afterwards. You’d think that he just hated women, but if he only hated them, he wouldn’t try getting close to them. In other words, he had a love-hate relationship with them.\nBeing cheerfully sociable, was a well-crafted lie. He was the type of character who had a good head on his shoulders.\nHis mother was a harlot. His father a nobleman. Pulled away from his mother, and only receiving neglect from his step-mother, when he somehow sneaked out and arrived at the nightstreet where his mother should have been, he found his mother running away with a new man. Such a painful pas– hold up, wait – wait just a moment.\nThe father in this case was Uncle Narcissus. Wouldn’t this mean, he received ill-treatment from Aunt?\n「Shade, she is your cousin. Beside her is the Duke of Lilia, my brother-in-law. Look carefully you two. The color in this child’s eyes are red」\nThis... happy-go-lucky Uncle, at the moment, he unveiled his family. Aah, isn’t this how he conducted himself when he was searching high and low for the many cultivated plants or purchasing them?\nAlthough it’s horrible, I’m already completely awake.\nFurthermore, this was closer than expected.\n「Your Grace. Miss Lycoris. Pleased to meet your acquaintance」\nHe — Shade, was anxiously clutching\nhis chest with small thin hands, but still, he smiled with all his might as he bowed his head. Because of the other party’s high social standing he didn’t really know what to do, but still, the young boy used all his might to show his thanks. This was how it looked like to me.\nI wouldn’t know what the actual contents of his heart is by only looking at what’s outside.",

      "content": "Afterwards, I was given some time alone with Shade.\nThe one who forcibly brought out this development was Uncle Narcissus. It seemed Uncle was serious when he asked me to take charge of Shade’s training, as that was how it was explained to Shade. Neither I nor my father remembered agreeing on this matter.\nI wonder what was the cause for Uncle’s forceful actions. Was he expecting something from me? Or was he hoping to get Father’s support on this? I can’t discard the possibility that he didn’t think about anything, though.\nAt any rate, this was a chance for me to ask the questions I had about this complicated situation.\n「I’d like you to call me Lycoris. There’s no need to add 『Miss』after all. Would it be alright if I called you Shade?」\n「Yes」\n「Have you already had dinner?」\n「Yes. I apologise for not coming out for dinner」\n「It’s fine, you don’t have to worry about things like that. By the way, what did you eat? Did you have the same meal we had for dinner?」\nAlthough internally, my heart was pounding as I asked the question, Shade smoothly replied that he had the same menu for dinner.\nI was relieved. It seems, at least for now, his meals haven’t been left out. While it was rude, I was able to hit the nail on the head by asking a slightly blunt question.\n「Do you have a small appetite? You seem incredibly thin」\n「No. That’s not the case... it’s only that I’m not used to the『good food』provided here」\nIt wasn’t an unnatural answer. For most people, it’s likely the things they ate from an early age would be what they would consider as delicious.\n「I see. Well, even if you get used to the meals here... you’d still yearn for your honored mother’s cooking, right?」\nAt the mention of his mother, his red eyes seemed to wobble and tremble.\nAnd then those eyes, towards me– towards the girl in front of him who had asked the rude question, sent just a small glare.\n「Even if I yearned for it, I can’t go back. After all, it was my mother’s own volition to send me away」\nFinally able to take a glance at him after he shared his sentiments, I was overcome by a strange sense of relief. That’s because, while being this small, having a person with complete control of himself as an opponent, somehow, I felt like I wouldn’t stand a chance.\n「That was careless of me to say, I’m sorry」\n「...it’s alright」\n「From tomorrow onwards, I’ll be teaching you a little bit about manners. It would truthfully be better if you learned this from a man, but for the time being, I’ll try to teach you what I can」\n「Yes. Thank you very much」\nShade smiled and laughed delightfully.\nThis one-year younger cousin of mine, the aspect of him that was very innocent seemed unnatural no matter what. Of course, this was because his personality had a gap with the game character Shade; but some might say that my opinion was biased.\nThat’s why when I saw this kind of smile, I instead ended up thinking that perhaps he used it when he wasn’t being honest.\n「Studying about manners is very important. If firmly disciplined, it’s an armor that can be used to protect yourself in the aristocracy. Because it would become your strength.」\n「...strength... is it?」(2)\n「Yes, that’s right. It’s strength in a broader sense. Did it pique your interest?」\nShade merely tilted his head, but I think it got a little of his attention. Even if this role of mine as a teacher was only for a short time, I wanted my student to have the desire to learn.\n「Then, let’s continue tomorrow」\n「Yes」\n「Good night」\n「Yes」\n「Good night」\n「...good night」\nFor boys of this age, it might be a bit embarrassing to have this exchange. But greetings are important. From tomorrow onwards, I will have to thoroughly train him on it.\nWhen I realized it, I completely became serious in taking up my role.\nAfter that awkward farewell, I parted with Shade and began walking towards the guest room.\nBecause I had visited this place countless times since I was still small, there was no need for someone to guide me there.\nFor the first time, I thought about Shade.\nI wanted to know his situation and his thoughts. For example, was Aunt really maltreating him? What were his thoughts about Uncle and Crinum? If I was able to obtained Shade’s trust, I wonder whether he would talk to me about them. Or, should it be with an adult he could trust– should I leave it to Father, then?\nUncle adores Shade, and Aunt most likely neglects him, at worse, he’s probably detested. In Crinum’s case, I wonder what she thinks of him?\nWhen she first learned about his existence, she must have been shocked. She probably despised her own father’s actions. And she might have even been angry about it. But, at present, I think she is taking care of Shade. Crinum is a nice girl.\nMy thoughts flew to the time I was playing with Crinum in this mansion.\nWhen I was young, I was holed up inside my room and was branded as a child that was only into books and nothing else; but, when father took me to come to this mansion, I didn’t have the free time to read those books. That’s because I was too busy playing with my gentle cousin who was close to my age.\nSince Aunt’s educational policy did not allow us to play outside, the young Crinum and I entertained ourselves by exploring every nook and cranny of the house, with dolls in one hand. As small children, the usually never visited closet or storage room was a world of unknown adventure to us; the strange appearance of the attic was what we were especially pleased with.\nTaking along our dolls to the attic, we chose to play pretend in the house. The little bit of sweets we hid in our pockets were all gathered there. I wonder if that attic still remains even now\nSuddenly wanting to talk with Crinum, I tried to turn back.\nSo there was no way with such a timing, could I have expected that I would be accosted by the person herself.\n「Lycoris」\n「Eeeh!? ...Crinum?」\nI likely jumped in surprised. Crinum’s thin body stood leaning on the wall, exactly in between the corridor’s lamps and lights.\nThe corridor’s lamps were in equal intervals; the parts that were bright and the parts that were dark were intensely different. Naturally, since I only concentrated on the parts that my eyes could see, it was only when I was this close that I noticed the other person.\n「S-sorry. I was lost in my thoughts while walking. For me to do such a thing, my attentiveness was half-hearted. What’s wrong? Were you waiting for me?」\nCrinum didn’t answer my question.\nWhen I tried to approach Crinum, she backed away several steps from me.\n「...Crinum?」\n「Lycoris, I have a favor to ask from you, so I was waiting for you」\nFinally, Crinum gave me an answer and I was relieved, her words rousing me.\n「What is it? Tell me whatever it is」\nI answered, puffing with pride. For example, if she wanted to speak out against Uncle, I’d happily do a suicidal attack on Uncle’s room.\nHowever, Crinum’s words were different from what I had expected.\n「Please, to that child– to Shade, don’t get too close... I’m begging you」(1)\nFacing down as she said it, I could not see her facial expression under the cover of the darkness.\n「Crinum? What do you...」\nMy question was drowned out, as she repeated「\nPlease\n」once again.\n「That’s... is it by any chance, because Aunt doesn’t want anyone to see that Shade is being maltreated, is it like that?」\nMentioning the likeliest possibility that I’d realized, Crinum hanged her head in shame.\n「You knew about it then. What Mother thinks of that child? Is the Duke also aware of this? Did you guys... come to this house for the sake of helping that child out?」\nSuddenly lifting up her head, her expression was brimming with hostility aimed towards me. I was shocked about various things, and yet confused.\n「No... I’d say it was only me who had thought of it. Most likely, Father has yet to notice it, and even if he did, if there was any way to settle it in this house, then he should have already gone and tried thinking of it」\n「I see... that’s good. Please, Lycoris. Don’t tell the Duke that Mother is treating that child badly」\n「That’s... If you’re the one that asks this of me, then I would grant the request, but... why? If you ask Father, then wouldn’t he be able to help Shade out? At this rate, I don’t think that Aunt will be okay at all. And if you left it to Father, then I doubt he would ever cause Aunt harm blindly. Let’s consider the best option for all of you」\nCrinum kept silent. After a long, long time, she finally opened her mouth.\n「You know, Lycoris. The first time I met that child, I thought what a beautiful child he was」\nThe vigorously unstoppable torrent of words that Crinum spoke out about, was not about Aunt.\n「But at the critical point of introduction, Father introduced me as that child’s older sister, and he said all of a sudden:『Crinum, if you didn’t have freckles, you would have looked a little similar to Shade』. I... was so ashamed. Somehow, I felt I couldn’t compare with that child’s face and I thought there was no way I could address myself as such. That child wasn’t just beautiful, he was also smart. At the start, he had a strange accent, but soon after, he began mimicking people’s pronunciations, and his way of talking became beautiful as well. When he first hears the words, most likely he hears the person’s pronunciations even before it leaves their mouths. Repeating those, it’s like he never had an accent when he talked. Isn’t that amazing? That child, on his own, spoke to me. He said that my freckles will vanish when I became an adult so it was okay, and that I... was really beautiful. But, as expected, standing before that child, I was perpetually terrified. But you know, a turning point came. For some time now, Father had wanted to obtain a particular rose, and he went far away for it. When Father left the house, Mother locked up that child. Telling us that we absolutely cannot bring out any food or water to him. I thought, that was something that cannot happen; so that night, I secretly came and brought some food and water to that child. That was the first time. That child spoke to me on his own. That child needed me. I...」(3)\nSpeaking in one breath until that point, Crinum seemed to return to me.\nWhen Crinum was engrossed with a book, she would discuss the hero or heroine’s sentiments, and became talkative. Right now, she stared dreamily like she did at those times.\nHowever, I wonder whether she realizes it. That is, the kinds of things that are coming out of her own mouth.\n（T...this is...）\nFrom her hands and also her pale lips, it was evident she was quivering, even in the dark. However, her words did not stop.\n「Lycoris, you’ve really become beautiful. And even long ago, you’ve always been smarter than I was. I... absolutely don’t want you to get close to that child!」\nSaying it over her shoulder with a strained-sounding voice, she ran away.\n—\n(1) She actually says “please” twice in this sentence. First, as どうか and then as お願い. The latter sounds more desperate.\n(2) Initially he was saying, “Strength?” But quickly added ですか, which is a polite way of asking. Scary kid.\n(3) When Lycoris said it was a torrent, it really was... when Crinum was speaking, there were no spaces/different paragraph. It just continued on. However, for the sake of my editor’s sanity, she asked me to add spaced to make it easier to read.\nedited it back to the original, because I was told by a certain someone to make the readers feel pain...",

      "content": "Family Arc – Chapter 5\nThe next morning.\nI started my special attack on Shade.\n「Good morning」\n「Ha...? Eh...?」\n「Good morning」\n「....good... morning」(1)\nEven though it was morning, my goal is to make sure that there won’t be a time he’d be impolite.\nIt looks like Shade is weak in the morning. With a sleepy look, he was bewildered in the face of an uninvited guest.\n「I apologize for the abrupt visit. But a lot of things are tangled up, and I already don’t know what – or perhaps I should say, I already don’t know whose feelings would be the correct one to prioritize. That’s why for the time being, let me hear about your sentiments. You.... In this house... you were locked in a room by Aunt, and your meals were stopped, right?」\nMomentarily dumbfounded by my non-stop chattering, he was then plainly suspicious; Giving me a look as if he was searching for my intentions, he stared at my face.\n「That is... who did you hear it from?」\n「From Crinum. And in truth, I did slightly doubt that possibility」\n「............」\n「It’s not like I’m asking you to trust me, whether it be me or my father, we are on Aunt’s side; I don’t have any means to dispel your suspicion on whether I’m really deceiving you or whether your distrust is unjust. But, I want you to answer me one thing no matter what. Why didn’t you tell Uncle that you were receiving terrible treatment from Aunt? Or for instance me or Father – you could have searched for someone reliable who could take care of you and get you out of this house. Was it that troublesome for you?」\n「I...」(2)\nBecause I was surprised at the first spoken word he said, he immediately gave out an apology.\n「That was rude of me. Since I was poorly brought up, I lost my focus for a second」\n「No, I don’t mind. In particular, if you’re able to converse with it, then it’s fine no matter what form of speech you use. But if you want to get used to polite speech, I’ll go along with you」\n「Well then, I do hope you forgive me even if I mix in inappropriate words. Personally, I do think you are a person I can trust」(3)\n「...even when you’ve only just met me yesterday? As you know, I am related to Aunt, the person who neglected you」\n「But... you’re related to me too. You’re my cousin, right?」\n「That – might be true, but...」\n「At least, no one in this house greets me with the common『Good night』 or 『Good morning』 courtesy. Compared to them, I\nconsider you as someone who I can speak frankly with」\n「Then, would you let me hear the reason? Why didn’t you say anything to Uncle?」\n「There was no major reason for why I didn’t do it. It was simply because it would be useless even if I did tell him」\nShade said indifferently, with something akin to coldness in his voice.\n「Aside from flowers, the only thing that person is interested in is my eye color. That’s it」\n「Eye color? Well, your eyes certainly are unique in color, did you happen to inherit it from your honored mother? 」\n「When you say『honored mother』, I had to think about who you were referring to. Mother was normal, she had brown-colored eyes. According to Father, the gene was from his grandmother passed through my father. In other words, I inherited this color from my great-grandmother」\n「Great-grandmother...? Oh, her...」\n「Were you acquainted with her?」\n「Since it’s regarding your father’s grandmother, it’s also related to me. She died long before I was aware of my surroundings so I personally didn’t know her. But, there were a lot of tales about her. Like, she completely ignored the marriage proposal from the royal king of that time. Now that you mention it, I feel like I’ve heard something about her unique eye color before」\n「In the Duke Lilia’s family, I heard that a lot of people had possessed hair and eyes of the color red」\nIndeed. My closet was filled up exhaustively with a puzzling rouge color. Could this literally be the clan’s image color?\nLooking at Shade’s dark red pupils under the morning sun, it was definitely a color closer to rogue.\n「Uncle was really fixated over this color, huh? Once in a while, there are those in the aristocracy who love their『Family lineage』 to death, but was Uncle also of that sort?」\n「That’s nearly a disease, isn’t it?」\n「Even with his abnormality, I don’t think it’s a reason to overlook the problem that’s happening in this family. For the time being, why don’t you try telling Uncle? But then again, wouldn’t this provoke Aunt...」\n「I’ve already told him. And he said, 『bear with it for a while』」\n「...eh?」\n「『Right now, my wife hasn’t seen what’s around her. But, she’ll realize your merit soon. Until then, bear with it for a while』」\n「That’s... what he told you? Bear with it? Is that... a line a father should be giving his child who’s being abused by his wife?」\n「At least, in Narcissus Rankgerüste’s case, it is」\nI was at my wit’s end.\nFor countless times since reuniting with Uncle yesterday, his favorability graph with me continued to decreasingly swoop, and I don’t know if it would stop at this point.\n「Okay, fine then. Let’s quit trying to rely on Uncle. You won’t be troubled if I told Father about it, right? Then, I’ll immediately inform him」\nWith this action, I’m probably betraying Crinum. When I begin thinking that she had confided in me because of our friendship, it frankly starts feeling painful in my chest. That said, seeing that there was a victim of child abuse, there was no way I could just remain watching in silence.\nShaking off last night’s events with Crinum which floated in my mind, I headed to Father in high spirits.\nHowever, this should have been called a trick of fate, since things didn’t go so smoothly.\n「Eh? He departed from the house this morning?」\n「Yes. It was before dawn. A messenger from the capital came by, it seemed there was a sudden job that arrived. Although he was worried about you, my lady, he couldn’t bring himself to wake you up, so he departed alone」\nWhen the butler explained the regrettable situation to me, I wound up placing a hand on my forehead.\nA messenger from the capital delivering urgent work to Father wasn’t rare. However, for this to happen so early in the morning, it was extremely unlucky.\nI ended up returning to Shade’s room dejectedly.\n「I’m sorry... it seems like I can only tell him as soon as he comes back here, after his work is over. In the meantime, I’ll do all I can to prevent Aunt from doing anything to you. That’s why, could you wait just a little bit more?」\nAlthough saying『wait just a little bit more』, was like repeating the hated words Uncle said, I was saved since Shade energetically nodded his head in my way direction.\nThat was the only thing I informed Shade about, before fleeing his room. Naturally, if Crinum found out that I carelessly went in and out of Shade’s room, I would never be able to look her in the eyes.\nFortunately, according to the maid, she was still in her room.\nSince it was awkward meeting Crinum at the breakfast table, I complained that I was hungry in order to quickly eat breakfast alone.(4)\nDoing this selfish thing in someone else’s house, who knows what others might think of it, but I wouldn’t be able to escape that problematic situation without making some sacrifices.\nHowever, once again, fate wasn’t treating me kindly.\nSince morning, with a daily lesson on how to take care of flowers, I ended up sharing the breakfast table with Uncle Narcissus.\nThe freshly-baked bread lined up on the dining table were attractive; even with the soup having a different flavor from what I had at home, it didn’t taste bad.\nIt would have been awesome if Father or Wolf & Duke Ranunculus sat in front of me, oh – just thinking of it shouldn’t be a sin.\nIn some respects, Uncle could make pleasant conversations, but my responses became unconsciously unenthusiastic.\nI had been trying to get Uncle to give a hand in investigating, but now, I’ve already completely given up on relying on him. Relying on Father would absolutely be better. That was how I felt.\n「Lycoris, do you always wake up this early in the morning?」\n「No, it’s because I slept a little early yesterday... Aren’t you also up early, Uncle?」\n「Watering the flowers is, in the long run, better to do in the morning. I’ll take a nap momentarily after eating a light breakfast」\nReally, Uncle’s life does seem to revolve around and focus on flowers.\nI inclined an ear to Uncle’s gardening lectures for the moment.\nAlthough my heart wasn’t dancing, a peaceful time passed by as it is – it was at the moment as I was reaching out for desserts. Uncle started dropping an exceptionally large-scale bomb on me.\n「By the way, Lycoris. Why don’t you, with our boy– Shade, get married?」\nRight here, Uncle somehow started speaking an alien language.\n—\n(1) Again, he’s adding a polite term. There’s no English translation to properly deal with this, but this is how I cut it “...Good(ohayou)... morning(gozaimasu)” . “Ohayou gozaimasu” is basically good morning. Leaving out gozaimasu is just “Morning”.\n(2) He use “Ore”... the little boy used “Ore”. Go back to Family-hen notes, if you didn’t understand why Lycoris was surprised...\n(3) he continues using “Ore”\n(4) 朝食の席 is actually breakfast seat, or the location you gather at breakfast. I don’t think anyone uses breakfast place/ breakfast seat in English though",

      "content": "Family Arc – Chapter 6\n『Haah?』even as I returned that, I was being mature.\nAfter all, what left my mouth was a very realistic objection.\n「But Uncle, I already have a splendid... fiancé...」\nMy engagement with Wolf had already been made public. There’s no way Uncle didn’t know about this.\nBy the way, the face I currently had on – was already magnificently cramped from twitching. But, it’s not as if Uncle notices anyway, right? Thus, I had sulked internally.\nWhether or not he was aware of the voice of my heart (No, he absolutely isn’t aware, I’m sure of it), he developed his own pet theory with eyes that gazed into the distance.\n「However, the rumour of why Kaffir was trying to marry you off to another family, was that it was because there was no one who could be your partner in this family. If that’s the case, there is a potential with Shade. After all, at that time when Kaffir was worrying about your engagement partner, he had yet to know about Shade」\nI wonder why I felt obliged to pursue this conversation even though there was such a gap in our communication.\nWhatever conjectures he might have, the engagement has already been decided. Even though I already told him about this, was it that difficult to understand?\n「... but, Uncle. That wasn’t what I meant at all... it’s not like I fell in love with Shade, and neither did he with me. And, I think the blood relations are too close to marry my cousin」\n「No, I don’t agree」\nUncle adamantly insisted.\n「Marrying a cousin should be the obvious thing to do. Rather, it’s precisely because the effort of inbreeding is being stopped that we are losing the『 Red of the Duke Family Lilia』」(1)\n『Red of the Duke Family Lilia』\nThough the words were unfamiliar, I somehow understood the meaning. It was as Shade said, former members of the Duke Family Lilia tended to have hair or eyes of the color red.\n「Uncle. Neither my eyes nor my hair are red. They’re pitch black」\nThat’s why I’ll be troubled if I were expected to revive the『Red of the Duke Family Lilia』or whatever it was, was what I was about to say, but Uncle cut me off.\n「But, that black hair and bright red lips are exactly like Grandmother’s. It’s definitely Elder Sister’s blood. You know, even among our clan, it was said that Elder Sister was especially similar to Grandmother. So for certain, Grandmother’s blood flows deep inside of you」\n「Well, I’m often told I look like Mother. But I don’t really know about Great-grandmother」\n「It appears you don’t understand the value of the『Red of the Duke Lilia Family』. In the old days, the people in our Duke Family, who were born having that red color, possessed strong magical ability with almost no exception. Even if I were to say that it was due to the power of the color red which led the Duke Family Lilia to prosper in the past, it is by no means an exaggeration!」\nUncle’s fervent speech, I felt, gradually grew eerie.\nI had already had enough, I need not use logic when arguing with Uncle. Generally speaking, I really want this conversation to end.\n「I’m... getting along well with my fiance. I like him」\nI didn’t use the word『Like』because it was convenient. I certainly do like Wolf. Those feelings went back and forth between friendship and love, though its standing position was something which was ambiguous.\nAlthough it wasn’t expedient, if I plainly refused his idea with just this, I certainly thought that Uncle might give up.(2)\n「No, if you have a person you love, it’s better if you aren’t bound to them」\nUncle’s words became more and more incomprehensible.\nAnd yet, Uncle rebuked me with a tone as if he was using some universal logic.\n「I heard Grandmother was this way, but my older sister had already been a person damaged in some aspect. Rather, by only looking at one person, it was a deep terrifying jealousy. Kaffir, in some way, suffered too. However, my older sister, who looked so much like Grandmother, had to be married off to a man inside the family. This was in the hope of getting a child with thicker blood. Even among those of the same generation, the voice of influential was strong. By an overpowering figure, Kaffir became the scapegoat... and when it was decided, everyone around him pitied him」(1)\nWhat was this? What was it with this man?\nIt was no good to believe anything this person says.\n「You’re very similar to Grandmother, as well as Elder Sister. Don’t you think that your disposition would be similar to theirs as well?」\nIt was as if those were, words of a curse.\nIf I continue to listen to Uncle’s words any further, I’ll likely become weird.\nI rushed out of the dining room.\nOut of the dining room, I had rushed.\nI couldn’t bring myself to return to my room alone.\nIf yesterday didn’t happen, I would have asked Crinum for help. However, even that was impossible right now.\nWanting to be healed by the trees for the time being, I headed to the unvisited garden of the Rankgerüste house.\nToday, because of Uncle, no matter how beautiful the flowers were, I didn’t want to see them. I don’t even want to be near the flowers that Uncle took care of.\nWhenever I caught a glimpse of the vivid colors of the flowers, I would continue to walk by changing my route. Occasionally, when I saw a bench that had the comfort of shade underneath the trees, I would remain sitting there, viewing the scenery and searching for a good leaf to make as a reed pipe. Then when I grew tired of it, I would get up to walk once again.\nBefore I knew it, the sun was already high up; but at that time, it wasn’t that I was lost in my contemplation. Instead, I believe that for the entire time, my exhausted mind completely blanked out.\nAnd so, around the time that I kept on walking unsteadily on my feet, I encountered Shade.\nSomehow, I didn’t think I would meet him outside.\nIt was probably because the impression that he had been locked up by Aunt was intense in my mind, that I thought so. In addition to that, was probably because his skin was almost transparent in its whiteness.\nBut, in any case, his appearance was that of an ordinary boy. There was nothing strange about him coming outside to play.\nInstantly after his face came to view, I’d perhaps put on an awfully unpleasant face. It was because I had remembered Uncle’s ridiculous proposal.\nHowever, just by lightly shrugging his shoulders, Shade instead showed his concern for me.\n「You’re terribly pale. I’d have thought you’d seen a ghost」\nA fair amount of time had already passed, yet any stranger who looked at my face could still tell that I seemed pale.\n「... there might be some in this house for all we know」\n「Who did you get bullied by?」\n「It was Uncle. Your honourable father」\nMy voice was heavy with resentment.\n「Sorry」\n「Why do you need to apologize for?」\n「For the time being, it’s because he’s my father. Since we’re on that topic, would you like to accompany me in making idle complaints about him?」\n「...thanks」\nWhen I considered that he was another victim that Uncle took advantage of, I relaxed.\nUpon deliberation, I told him about the conversation I had with Uncle.\nSpilling all my complaints to『Shade』 was something that I would never have imagined I’d do when coming to this mansion.\nBut now, to Uncle’s ideas– to the ridiculous idea of Shade and I getting married to each other or whatever else, the fact that the other party was here laughing together with me at the『nonsense』 , was a lifesaver.\nIt was fun having him listen to my stories about Wolf. By now, just mentioning『Wolf』 made my heart feel at ease. I am... considerably tired.\nAll the same, I didn’t intend to tell him about the conversation about Mother. In the conversation I had with Uncle some time ago, this was the topic that damaged my feelings the most, but even inside, I wasn’t able to sort it out.\n「And after that, Uncle said something about my mother.」\nEh?\n「He said Mother was similar to Great-Grandmother, and that both of them had been horrifyingly jealous people. On the contrary, in what aspect was the damage that he would say such a thing? For Father to have had no intention of marrying Mother... then, wouldn’t that be like saying that I... was- I didn’t intend to tell you these sort of things」\nShade smiled sweetly, and my, what a lovely smile it was.\n「It doesn’t matter what the story might be. I’ll happily hear it. Surely, it would be better to talk about it and become at ease. Once all the talking is over, it’ll be fine to leave the rest to me. You want to rest, right? Your face looks incredibly tired」\nShade’s thin fingers trailed my cheeks.\n「N-no!」\nWith a do or die spirit, I broke free from his hand.\nHis voice was sweet. I knew following his voice would’ve been much more pleasant. Just thinking about going against it had been discomforting.\nBut somewhere in my mind, alarm bells were sounding. These were the kind of alarm bells that must never ever be ignored.\n「I’d thought if it was a case of a steel-hearted woman, but was it more of the case of a strong will? No, that isn’t it – Or, maybe it’s a problem of a magical disposition. Whatever the case, this is troublesome」\nHolding my jaw with a jerk, I began to look into his eyes.\nI ended up once again, peering deeper, and deeper into those rouge-colored eyes. I couldn’t look away.\nMy whole body was rigid, my heart was thumping as my pulse raised. Not able to control the strength of my clenched fist, my nails were biting into my skin.\n「You’re a good girl, after all. Just listen to what I say, and I’ll be sure not to do anything naughty」\nWhen he whispered so closely in my ear like that, I–\nPunched the side of Shade’s face with all the strength in my fist.\nAnd from there, I enacted my suicidal escape.\nSince Shade was momentarily taken aback from being hit in the face, I ran towards the house. After noticing this, he gave chase.\nHaving someone seriously chasing me was a truly frightening affair. Moreover, I was wearing a dress. Why were skirts made to be difficult to run with?\nBut thankfully, Shade was not quick on his feet. By dashing with all I had, the distance between us did not shorten.\n（But, who in the world would I get help from?）\nThere was no way I can keep running all the way to my house. However, if I escaped into a place inside this building, would there be anyone who would lend me a hand?\nAs my bearish sentiments reared its ugly head, my feet’s movement slowed down.(3)\nYou could say that, in the nick of time, I was yanked to the side by a pull on my hand.\nWith a determined look ahead, he stepped forward, passing me from the side, revealing himself, somehow catching my feet from falling over as it got tangled up.\nThis person... who protected me by yanking me behind his back, without even making a sound, hit Shade who was running from behind!\n「Wolf!」\nThere was no way I could have been mistaken at that moment. This person, was Wolfgang Eisenhut.\nAfter Wolf hit Shade, his arms quickly twisted around Shade, locking him in place.\n「My hand acted out instinctively... but is this okay?」\n「Right on! Ah... what I mean is – that’s... in this case, at the very least, Wolf isn’t in the wrong!」\nI corrected my statement, because right behind Wolf was the Rankgerüste house butler, who was looking at our direction with perfectly round eyes.\n「When Duke Lilia told me『I’ll entrust my role as Lycoris’s knight to you』, I thought the duke was joking around, but.... what on earth is going on?」\n「I really love Father and Wolf!」\n「L-love...? Ah – no – I’m not unsatisfied, though...」\n(1) Basically I think when he meant by thicker blood, is that the bloodline is kept within the family, so that the descendents will inherit the powers of Narcissus’s grandmother.\n(2) This is an unknown word to me, so I’m not sure if I used it right...\nexpedient is an adjective which means useful for effecting a desired result; suited to the circumstances or the occasion; advantageous; convenient\n(3) bearish: the thought that things will fail. That is, pessimistic.\nDoes anyone read notes? This is a small one, extra line from light novel it seemed, thanks to kazeyuki for giving me this info.\nFor those who read till the end...\n“Wolf’s face turned visibly red”",

      "content": "Family Arc – Chapter 7\n「Just a few moments ago, it was magic being casted on me, wasn’t it?」\nUpon my interrogation, Shade replied with a face feigning ignorance.\n「What might this be about?」\nShade’s hands were bound behind him, and a blindfold covered his eyes.\nOf course, the one who did all those was me.\nAlthough Wolf’s single blow to Shade’s stomach was not visible from the clothes he wore, my punch wedged a painful cut on his lip. Nevertheless, I won’t show him any sympathy.\nEven though the cheek I striked using all my strength had swollen up, reaching up to this point had been on the verge of vexing.\nShade did not have any indication of confessing, but alternatively, after receiving my explanation and pondering over the situation, Wolf began speaking.\n「From what I heard so far, he possesses magical attributes by 『escaping the sealing』」\n「Escaping the sealing?」\n「You also received a『sealing』from the magical association when you were five, right?」\n「Yes. So that our magic doesn’t run wild. It was for that purpose, wasn’t it?」\nIt was in accordance to Wolf’s explanation.\nAll children of the nobility who possessed magical attributes were subjected by the association to a magical『sealing』 in their early childhood. And then, that magical ability will be plainly manifested once they hit puberty, passing over the state wherein magic could not be used, they would enter the magical academy at twelve years old. From there, by learning the control of magic, the sealing would gradually be released.\nIn other words, a『sealing』was for when the awaken magical ability, with a naive state of control, rampaged; for such scenarios, this was a preventive measure.\nIncidentally, this was only limited to the children『of the nobility』. After all, currently almost all the magical attribute holders were of noble blood. Whether the special abilities have always solely manifested in the nobility, or whether the increased possession of the power in the nobility was just recently attained, there were varying theories on that topic.\n「Even if one receives magical powers at birth, there were two general exceptions where one would not receive a seal. One, is a child born out of wedlock. Another case would be when a child is born into a family of non-nobles and obtained the magical power through a mutation. Meaning whichever of the two, since the association would not be aware of those kinds of existence, it would result in an exception」\nAlthough I was gaping with my mouth open like an idiot while listening to Wolf’s explanation, I finally came to my senses.\n「H-hey, aren’t you somehow well-informed? Concerning the information on magic, except for casual matters, they’re not granted to children, right? I’d been told that until we enter the academy, self-study, including theoretical study, were banned without exception. In fact, I couldn’t get my home-tutor to teach me anything about it. Furthermore, whether it be children or even adults, didn’t they make a darling trick so that any books related to magic were unreadable so long as they weren’t graduates of the school? 」\n「Yeah, that’s true... but, actually, there’s a loophole. Not only can you acquire a certain amount of knowledge from the adults’ conversations, but as a matter of fact, if you go to the capital, with a small amount of cash you can get that trick temporarily removed from the books...」\nVery sulkily, I gave Wolf a glare.\nMy curiosity long ago motivated me to stealthily go into my Father’s study, the bitter memory of how I felt unwell, not able to leave my bed for half a day right after taking a peek at the book related to the magic’s principles that I secretly borrowed, resurfaced.\n「That’s typical for men, isn’t it? For women in the family restricted by the conduct built by seemingly obvious unwritten rules, going outside on their own would be a self-indulgence, don’t you think?」\n「W-well... this probably isn’t the time for that kind of conversation, isn’t it?... right now, this conversation is about him」\nHaving blatantly been diverted from the topic, I turned around to face Shade. Of course, it wasn’t because I had been fooled. I vowed to myself that once this matter was over I would press him on that no matter what.\nWith Wolf’s earlier explanation, an example of magic obtained through mutation by birth, was the heroine.\nAnd then, the child born out of wedlock– in other words, a child born from a moment aside that of the binding of a married couple in accordance to marriage, such scenario where escaping the association’s eyes was a possibility – that was most likely a matter about Shade.\n「『Escaping the sealing』 was it... but, once it’s found out that he has noble blood, wouldn’t the association say or do something about it?」\n「Of course, they ought to speak out. However in that scenario, the child would already be proficient at the manifestation of his abilities, so the association’s sealing becoming incomplete is possible」\n「I see... so then, for example if the association gets notified that a child with magic was using it – what would happen if that was leaked out to them?」\n「There’s nothing that can be done if it’s not in the scope of a criminal act. A more robust seal known in the association would only be applied to that person.」\n「Then what if it was a criminal act?」\n「Besides putting that person on trial, a semi-permanent magical seal will be placed on him」\nI turned back to look at Shade, however the colour on his face did not change appearance.\n「Is there something like a mind-controlling magic?」\n「That would be fascination magic. The effect is stronger on the opposite sex, if the other party has their mind in a weakened condition, then the effect would become even stronger. In a manner of speaking, although the magic is only displaying the most attractive part of the person, it’s troublesome depending on the level of magical power used」\nWith that, I had expected by such a lack of skill that I was just about to obtain knowledge.\n「Shade, did you use that kind of magic on Crinum?」\n「Well, I honestly don’t know what this is about...」\nShade showed a laudable face.\nAh, geez, this is troublesome.\n「I guess, there’s no other choice but torture...」\n「Please don’t tell jokes with such a serious-looking face – ...you were joking, right?」\n「Who knows」\nHuh? Wasn’t Wolf a little troublesome as well?\nNo, rather, for the time being, let’s leave the matter regarding Wolf aside. This is about Shade right now.\nTo start with, he has no doubt『escaped the sealing』.\nHowever in that case, it would become a matter that would overturn my one prejudice with Shade.\nThe game’s Shade, of all things, had lied even to the game’s heroine.\nNo, maybe he was lying, or maybe in fact, he just purposely omitted things from his statements. There should be a considerable difference with those, but if it was the latter, I feel that it can either be forgivable or unnecessarily vicious.\nAt any rate, when Shade told the heroine about the contents of his past, there was no indications of matters relating to him having『escaped the sealing』 and the likes.\nSpeaking of which, he didn’t even allude to Crinum.\nIf I remember correctly, the『Shade talks about the past』event was an event that happened pretty early on. Inside the game, for the purpose of attracting the heroine to him, he probably cleverly concealed the bad parts of his circumstances when he spoke about the past.\nThat is to say, the current reality.\n「When you were casting magic to make your older sister an ally, did you make it more effective than what you’d planned?」\nTwitch, Shade’s body moved.\nI guess I got it right.\nSome gaps remained, but something like this was, as expected, a little abnormal.\nIf he wanted to make Crinum his ally, I dare say, he only had to behave courageously then it would have been okay, wouldn’t it? Crinum is, by nature, a gentle girl.\nMost likely, the action of bringing Shade food and water was not because of the involvement of Shade’s magic. It was an action made entirely on her own, that’s what I believe.\nAnd yet, Shade used his own magic to control such a girl like Crinum. Maybe it was that he didn’t trust her, or maybe it was that he couldn’t trust her.\nHaving no faith in women– no, it’s not as if he relaxes his guard around men, so maybe he has no faith in anyone. He did not trust people, because distrust was an important point constructed for Shade’s character in the game.\nWhich reminds me, Shade’s bad ending basically developed from a strong jealousy for not believing the heroine and fear since he didn’t want to lose the heroine. It might be the template behavior of a yandere though.\n「Wolf, what is the method to cancel out fascination magic?」\n「Since it’s not permanent, as long as it isn’t reapplied, it should eventually cancel out on its own」\n「Then, once Crinum returns to her true character, she’d be a living witness to Shade’s magic, right?」\n「That would be a little doubtful. The difficulty with fascination magic is that it’s hard to know if the effect is due to the result of the magic or the natural charm of the user」\n「Wolf! Why are you saying that in front of Shade!」\n「Well. He probably knows his own powers the best. That’s why, if we’re talking about a reliable method, I believe a few violent threats would prompt a confession from him...」\n「Rejected!」\n「Then, it would be better to leave this to an adult. Thankfully, Duke Lilia is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow」\nThat was really pleasant news.\nSince Uncle came into the room with the butler, we explained Shade’s magic briefly and left the room.\nIf it were only possible, I would not have wanted Uncle and Wolf to be in each other’s presence, and neither did I want to show my face to Uncle as much as I can.\nAfterwards, I was glued to Wolf throughout the day, not leaving his side. Well, of course, it was only a metaphor, though.\nThere isn’t only one person, but two people here, I was deeply moved for it to have reassured me this much.\nJust now at the dinner table at the Rankgerüste house, it was only me present, but in this case, I felt at ease.\nAlthough Uncle prepared a room for Wolf far from the guest room I was using, I was satisfied that I won’t somehow be receiving Uncle’s indirect harassment. Anyhow, if I do receive it, it was a distance I can immediately run. No, if there was any disturbances, I should tell him to stop.\nAt any rate, I was lying on the bed thinking about the degree of unexpected and unpleasant events that happened today with a peace of mind.\nProving it was Shade’s power that was to blame, meant Crinum’s sudden change wasn’t because of the actual person herself (or – I don’t know whether or not it’s right to declare this, but at the very least it wasn’t only because of her) and knowing this was a big deal. The hope that I might be able to reconcile with my precious cousin if given time filled my chest.\nAbove all, I was assured that once tomorrow morning come, Father will turn up and solve everything.\nEverything.\nHowever, there was only one thing for me that if nothing was done, wouldn’t get resolved.\nIn the end, I didn’t tell the comments about Mother that my Uncle said even to Wolf.\nWolf would probably tell me that I would understand if I heard the real situation from my father. If I were on the opposite end, that would have been my advice.\nHowever, I wanted to clearly delay thinking about that.\nSeveral excuses floated to mind.\nIn the first place, it was about a dead person. Consequently, if it was about slandering a dead person, I’m sure Father too, would dislike the idea.\nAlthough Father was a person who liked talking, even so, topics about Mother rarely ever come up, of course, since he doesn’t want to talk about it, he probably wouldn’t talk about it.\nIf I ask him「Did you love Mother?」and listened, I wonder how Father would respond.\nIt was a matter of the past.\nBut, if there was one thing I was curious about, it would be about this.\nThankfully, my eyes were closing and drowsiness was overwhelming me. The fact that it wasn’t only because of my heart, but also because of my tired body after walking profusely, was a blessing.\nOnce my eyes closed, it would stay like that till morning.\n...though I said that, it didn’t go as planned.",

      "content": "Family Arc – Chapter 8\nWith a trembling body after being shaken, I was pulled from the edge of sleep.\nJudging from the sensation I had, shutting my eyes and sinking into the sea which was the futon as my awareness was nearly on the brink of slipping away, I was then pulled out with a net, that was how it felt like.\nThe owner of the hand that rudely shook a person’s shoulder – was Shade’s.\n「...??」\nSurprised by the invasion of an unwanted visitor while getting up from bed, it was considerably clear that I awakened in an instant.\n「W-what on earth?」\nShade was standing next to the bed I slept on, adjusting his heavy breathing.\nThe reason that I did not poke fun at him by saying things like “Are you a pervert?!”, was because no matter how I looked at it, that situation was not natural. The white face that the faint light on my bedside illuminated was, to an extent, ghostly pale.\n「Did something happen?」\n「F-father, he...」\n「What about Uncle Narcissus?」\nShade, who had an unprecedented frantic look on his face, caught my attention.\n「My eyes, he told me to hand it over」\nThese were Shade’s excessively outlandish words.\nBut I felt like I’ve heard it somewhere before.\nInside the game.\n『When I was a child, my father said “hand over your eyes”, and chased after me』\nThis matter was never further explained; whether it was a joke or it wasn’t, it was depicted in such a way that even the user and even the heroine really didn’t grasp it.\nHowever, I’ve already experienced a glimpse of it in this reality. Through Uncle’s obsession with regards to the『Red of the Duke Lilia Family』\n「Don’t tell me... right now – you’re being chased by Uncle?」\nI only managed to ask that, when Shade nodded his head several times.\nJust then.\nA knock resounded across the room.\nI dragged Shade under the futon, just finishing to haul up the quilt.\nMy personal cloth covered the bedside’s magical lamp to turn the light off.\nThe sound of a knock – continued on.\n「Y-yes. Who is it?」\nWhile praying from the bottom of my heart wishing I was with Wolf, I clasped my two trembling hands together.\n「Lycoris. It’s me. It’s Narcissus. I’m sorry since it’s late, but did Shade happen to come in?」\n「He didn’t come in」\nI regretted it right after it was said. It was way too unnatural for a person who had just awoken to respond with an answer. ‘What’s wrong?’, or something of the likes should have been what I asked in returned.\n「I’m coming in」\nWithout waiting for even an acknowledgement, Uncle entered the room as if he owned the place.\nInside the room, was pitch dark.\nAs Uncle continued his approach, I waited while suppressing my nerves until he was at the side of the bed, then – I hurled the pillow I’d been gripping towards him.\nHaving thrown it with the force of my whole body, it was very fortunate that it hit him on the face, breaking my bewildered Uncle’s stance. I took Shade’s hand and ran towards the door.\nAlthough escaping to Wolf’s room had also crossed my mind, his room was on the opposite direction from the stairs. Rather than involving Wolf, I deemed the matter of letting Shade escape be settled first. (1)\n「Let’s escape outside!」\nShade and I ran down the stairs, towards the door that was connected to the outside.\nBut, the locking of the big door was, even from the inside, something that us children couldn’t do anything about. Naturally, there was no time to look for the key.\nI asked Shade if he happened to know a place that led outside, but he shook his head while taking in a painful-looking breath. Even for me, though I’d played around this mansion before, a way to go out from this place, with the exception of the door, was a matter that I’d never considered.\nFor instance, there was such a method of leaping out of a raised window in a room somewhere in order to escape. But right now, we didn’t have the courage to leap into any of the lined up rooms at the side of the hallway. That is, our group of shorties was in a situation where a window would be an unusable form to move in or out, possibly, owing to the form of the key, we’d be in a state where we’d be imprisoned at a dead-end.\nWhile we didn’t find the best plan, the sound of footsteps coming closer as it continued to descend, urged us to run towards a different staircase. Then, through the direction of the upper floors, we headed to the attic room. In there was the only place I knew in this Rankgerüste mansion where holing ourselves was possible.\nWe rushed up the stairs as fast as we could, and leaped into the attic room. Collaborating with Shade, we piled up absolutely every bit of items within the vicinity in front of the door to use as a barricade. Then, I gave the instruction to Shade in order to climb up the ladder at the corner of the room.\nThis attic room’s structure was two stories. Generally, the room entered from the door was the first story. From there, climbing ahead through a simple ladder was the second story.\nAfter Shade had ascended, I followed as well, if we pulled in the ladder from the top, it’s expected that no one else would think of climbing up. Sitting in that place, our heavy pants were cut off by violent coughing induced by the increasingly bad atmosphere.\nAlthough we quickly opened the window, there was no wind so it didn’t offer much ventilation; at the side of the window with Shade, our two sitting forms settled down.\n「That guy – do you think he’ll go as far as to come here?」\n「...most likely. The other party has the territorial advantage. And our whereabouts will probably be exposed. Even with the barricade, since it’s only made on the spot, I think something like that wouldn’t hold him off. For the time being, once he breaks through the barricade, let’s just throw any of the stuff here at him」\nIndeed, since this place is used as the usual storage room, there are a lot of items placed here.\nFor example, apart from Uncle preparing a ladder in order to climb up, it will probably buy us some time while causing hindrances.\n「What on earth happened for it to turn out like this?」\nOnce the front of his face came into view again, Shade’s complexion seemed even more terrible. I just realized it now, but under the illumination of the moonlight, his pale skin had a small injury that appeared to be a scratch. It was a different injury than what I had caused during the day.\nAlthough my wariness towards Shade hadn’t disappeared, all the same, in this situation his overall acting probably deserved praise now.\n「After I was handed over to that man from your hands, I was imprisoned in my room alone. But, once night fell, that guy came to my room. He said he wanted to properly talk with me」\n“At long last” probably, and it seems like I wasn’t the only one who had that thought.\n「I thought why was it only now, you know. I had already had my feigned friendliness almost peeled off anyway, so since I considered it was finally the right opportunity, I spat out the resentments I’d been bottling up」\n「Such as?」\n「You’ve been spoken ill of for your incompetency. You’re simply not someone I can respect as a father. Do you truly believe that I’m your son? If I inherited your blood then I should be more of a moron.... of course, in truth, the words I said were even more vulgar than that though」\n「Eh? You... were you not related to Uncle by blood?」\n「No. While it’s unfortunate, I probably am that man’s son」\nIn other words, his depression piled up to the extent that if he didn’t say “you’re not my father”, he wouldn’t be able to calm down. Somehow I understood.\n「And then... he said『hand over your eyes』?」\n「Yeah. He said “hand over your eyes, then leave this house”. That was the first time I heard that guy’s angry voice straight up」\nAn unpleasant sweat ran down my spine. The sweat might probably be partly because it was getting colder, but it felt like nothing could be done about the unpleasant coldness.\nThen in that timing, the door connected to the corridor made a clattering sound.\nGa-tan, ga-tan,\na dreadful sound continued to reverberate.\n「Lycoris. You’re in there, aren’t you? Come out. I’m not angry with you. You’ve done nothing bad, right?」\nOf course, I absolutely didn’t come out and just remained silent.\nI desperately removed my presence and even went as far as to shorten my breathing. Nevertheless, the barricade was not as strong as my determination.\nGa-tan. Ga-tan. Ga-tan. Ga-tan.\nJust a little bit each time, it carried along the door, after the gap of the door and the barricade was approximately ten centimeters from opening up, it became insubstantial.\nUncle placed his foot into the attic room.\nAt the moment, Uncle was searching around the attic leaving a huge shadow of a luggage while calling out in a soft, coaxing voice.\n「Shade, if you’ve reflected, come out right now and I’ll forgive you. Then, you and Lycoris can be married and make children. Children having red eyes. No doubt they’ll be born possessing magnificent abilities. Grandmother, the one who’ll grant your dearest wish, is not your precious Kaffir! It’s the one you looked down on, the one you shunned –\nME\n!」\nHis voice had become louder in his excitement, after that, it suddenly became silent.\n「Aah, I see. Didn’t I tell you it’s dangerous for children to climb up to such a place」\nIn the past, I wonder whether Uncle said such a thing.\nRather, in more detail, matters like that were things that left Aunt’s mouth, Uncle should’ve been completely uninterested with how much we played around or anything of the like.\nThat’s right. Since long ago, Uncle, didn’t have any interest in us.\nBe it Crinum, or Aunt, they were never a target of Uncle’s interest.\nEven Shade, his existence was not what pulled Uncle’s interest in the truest sense.\nFrom above, we were supposed to throw things at Uncle or something and gloat about it, but I wasn’t able to move from the side of the window. Just like me, no – even more than me, curling up his frightened body was Shade. No matter how arrogant an aspect of him was, he was still a younger kid than me.\nThe two of us, possessing no courage to peek from the gaping wide open square hole to the room below out of the reaches of the moonlight, merely nestled close to each other quivering. If I peered below, “wouldn’t a monster having a completely different appearance from Uncle be there?”, was what I truly thought.\nWhatever was happening down below, it was making a clattering sound.\nI was increasingly petrified. Even without preparing a ladder, if it was an adult, they’d be able to come here by climbing up if there was a slightly tall stool, was what dawned on me.\nA long time ago, when the young Crinum and I took refuge here, I realized now that the reason we were left alone was because of Aunt and Uncle’s compassion.\nI shut my eyes tightly and continued to block my ears, huddling up my body in order to cover Shade. Most likely, with a squeezed out voice, I called out for someone to save us.\nGan.\nBa-tan.\nA loud thud sounded from below.\nIt was a sound that reached even my blocked ears.\nThen a voice.\n「\nDon’t treat the children as your toys! Especially not my daughter!!\n」\nWith my father’s strong words, tears spilled over from my eyes.\n(1) At first, I considered using “top priority”, but the meaning I understood is that, as long as Shade escapes, Lycoris and Wolf won’t be harmed. So she wants to let Shade escape, before she gets Wolf involved to settle the matter. It kinda sounded like she wanted to involve Wolf in the mess, which I don’t think so...",

      "content": "Family Arc – Chapter 9\nFollowing that, Wolf leapt in and, with his help, Father immediately tied Uncle up.\nIn the aftermath, starting with Aunt, Crinum and Mr. Butler, each and every member of the Rankgerüste family assembled. Several people within were completely ignorant of what just occured, thus had on confused faces.\nWith the relevant people assemebled in the living room (of course, excluding Uncle), the details of the matter, after we settled down, had been explained like this.\nFirst, why had Father been in the Rankgerüste mansion at this hour?\nFrankly, after he’d finished work at the capital (the work’s detail was to escort a guest of honor to a night party) Father had already decided that he was going to return here by this evening from the start. The reason why I’d been informed that it was tomorrow morning or so was because to complete one more errand of his, it didn’t look like he’d be able to return before I went to bed.\nThe one more errand referred here was, an anticipated private conversation with Aunt in the Lilia mansion.\nEven though I said that, it wasn’t for a tryst.\nIt seemed Aunt had to say it at all cost, the contents of the conversation was a confession of sins. Aunt started from what she did to Shade and continued as far as Uncle’s plans on wanting to hasten my marriage with Shade at any cost.\nThat idea of Uncle’s looked like it made Father raging mad, while absolutely thinking of knocking Uncle out, it seemed he rushed to the Rankgerüste mansion in the middle of the night.\nAs for why Wolf was here, somehow, after parting with me at night, it looked like Uncle expelled him out of the house. He had been confused. A ten year old child, moreover, with the title of the prime minister’s son that Wolf possessed, to be driven out in the middle of the night from a house – in various senses, the absurdity was in a level of its own.\nBut you could say Wolf had considerable guts. After pretending to return to the inn by the abandoned road, it looked like he tried and succeeded to sneak into the house.\nFirst, he headed to my room, but found it completely empty. Thereupon, he met up with Father and Aunt.\nWolf:\n「Lycoris isn’t inside!」\nFather:\n「What did you say? I also can’t find a trace of Narcissus」\nAunt:\n「Shade isn’t around either! Don’t tell me – did that man force the two of them to get married!?」\nThe conversation sounded like it went something like that.\nAunt’s thoughts lacked common sense.\nThough, I think that was within the bounds of the situation that led to being told in the middle of the night to『hand over your eyes』among other things and chased around.\nRight then, Crinum came into sight, testifying that the sound of clattering was coming from the direction of the attic for some reason. Even the servants, who slept in a separate building, gradually gathered straight to the attic room, that was how it seemed.\nTo sum it all up.\nThe reason why Father punched Uncle without any time to argue sounded like it was because a misunderstanding played a part in it.\nGeez, my father was too magnificent. His figure as he snappily instructed the Rankgerüste servants within the intervals of the conversation was awfully cool.\nIncidentally, as we listened to the story, Shade was wrapped in a blanket with a warm drink in hand and, it goes without saying, I was clad in a blanket on top of Father’s lap the entire time .\nWolf stared in this direction with an envious look, but just for today, even if Wolf was the one who wanted this seat, I wasn’t willing to give it up. Sorry, Wolf.\n「Father, your help was honestly appreciated」\nWhen I once again voiced my gratitude, Father smiled shyly.\n「No, actually, I couldn’t have imagined that you’d call me in that setting... I was really happy」\n「That setting?」\n「Just before I jumped into the attic」\nNow that he mentioned it, I might have said something then.\nI mean, well, I probably did.『Father, help!』or something.\nEmbarrassed by my own childish behavior, I pressed my face against the bottom of Father’s neck.\n「You don’t have to make that face. After all, I’m more or less an adult man and a father. I had only a slight superiority in terms of abilities」\nWhatever it was that he’d considered, Father’s words had been directed at Wolf.\n「Thanks for your concern. But this happened because I wasn’t by her side then」\nSpeaking of Wolf, really.\nHim saving me from Shade was a story of just half a day ago, had he already forgotten about it?\nFor the sake of passing what I’d also recalled of the events, I explained how Wolf played the role of a cool knight to Father.\nThus, while talking with Father and Wolf, I truly felt like we’d passed over a terrible storm at last.\nEventually, Crinum left the room so as to support Aunt. Just before then, she bowed her head apologetically towards me and my heart was exhilarated. Supposing that my friendship with her really returned to the way it was, then it would be a completely joyous affair.\nEven after Crinum settled down in this room, it didn’t seem like she’d try talking to Shade to get closer to him. ‘Was this because of the rejection or was it because of the confusion?’, the conclusion was difficult to say. (1)\nIn Aunt’s case, I knew that it was the fault of that uncle that she faced a lot of hardships. Still, the things she did to Shade ought to be her wrong.\nWhat will happen to Crinum and Aunt? That was probably a matter the ladies would have to decide themselves, though Father wouldn’t be unwilling to lend his help, and there might be something I can do to help as well.\nThen, when the butler was about to urge Shade in the same way to leave the room, he suddenly began trudging his way here.\nThanks to the blanket wrapped up around his body, the flush on his lips and cheeks returned.\nI greeted him by going down from the top of Father’s lap.\nThe first thing Shade did was to turn about and politely lower his head towards Father.\n「Duke Lilia, thank you very much for your help earlier」\n「No, you’ve suffered through a lot, didn’t you? I hope you’ll be able to sleep well even if it’s just by a little bit more from now on」\nShade gave a troubled-looking smile. The thin fingers that were tightly grasping the blanket were, in some respect, pitiful.\n（Nh?）\n「Lycoris. I truly regret involving you in all this. At that time, you were the only one I could count on...」\n「...no. It’s not like you were the one at fault」\n「Thank you. If you weren’t around at that time. I shiver at the thought. If I’d been alone, around this time...」(2)\nShade, who was looking frightened by his wild imagination, took out his hands from under the blanket and reached out to mine. Perplexed by having my hands held, I call out to him saying “it’s going to be alright now”.\nSpeaking as a person who equally tasted that fear, I knew that it was truly a terrifying feeling. I knew that, but...\nAt that moment, hearing our conversation, Father spoke up in a somewhat high-spirited voice.\n「In front of a boy younger than her, Lycoris-chan properly acts as an older sister, doesn’t she? Having similar outfits on, the both of you are adorable. It’s like the two kids standing next to each other are angels, you know」\nIt was impossible.\nAn impossibly spontaneous remark.\nBy the way, the 『similar outfits』he was referring to, was this sort of appearance where we were awkwardly clad in blankets.\nBefore I could even say a word, Wolf plainly reminded Father.\n「Duke Lilia. He’s using fascination magic. Please take note」\nI nodded my head while sounding my agreement. No matter how scary the future he’d have suffered was, Father had considered Shade’s behavior too admirably.\n「It’s alright. Fascination magic doesn’t work on me」\nTo have Father clearly assert with a denial – I, Wolf, and even Shade widened our eyes with shock.\n「Even if I look like this, I was an honor student in the magical academy. Since I had a good conduct and the aptitude, I was even allowed to use fascination magic. However, to be pushing your luck with opponents who hold suspicions, you’re still quite green. This... magic, you see, if you were to say, use it here, you have to absolutely let no one know you’re using it in order to display its true value」\nHaving said that, Father showed Shade an awfully gentle smile. Shade’s expression was dyed in bewilderment.\n「Ah, don’t misunderstand, Lycoris. I’ve never used unnecessary magic in my life, and even after this, I definitely won’t. You see, in the case of magic that works on the mind, it’s an act that twists human relationship after all. If all of you study earnestly in that school as well, I’m sure you’ll learn to use magic with a purpose and a reason」\nIsn’t that like saying he’s using it moderately at work? Of course, Father is only engaging in diplomacy though.\nSince it’s kind of scary, it’s probably better to leave it unasked.\nWhile shelving it away in my mind, I nodded at Father’s words.\nNow then, as for Shade.\nHe drew back a short distance away from Father.\nMaybe for him, this could be the first time he met an opponent whom his own magic truly couldn’t pass through.\nYet, instead of turning his heels and escaping, he remained.\n「What will become of me?」(3)\n「I also feel responsible for what was done to you by your father and mother at this house. I deeply apologize. What’s more, I’d wanted to introduce you to a reliable caretaker, but...」\n「Is it difficult?」\nI cut into the conversation, and Father gave a troubled-looking smile.\n「To tell you the truth, if I left him under the poor care of a relative unintentionally, I’m afraid a second or a third Narcissus might surface」\nMy face cramped from twitching.\n「F-Father, please stop joking」\n「It’s not a joke...」\nWhile saying that, Father gazed at Shade’s red eyes.\nAs for me, I despaired at the muddled ways of the relatives of our house.\n「Of course, even so, there are still family members who can be trusted. Unfortunately, in this case, by leaving you in their care, you might end up standing in a maelstorm」\n「Then wouldn’t it be better to find a completely unrelated family with no blood relation? 」\n「In that case, it would probably become a tremendous blow for us. After all, it would mean revealing the 『Red of the Duke Family Lilia』to the outside」\nWith those words, a little bit of cynicism left Father’s mouth.\n「But Father, if that’s done...」\n「The choices are roughly the same. In other words... our family will take charge of him or something of the like」\nWith Father’s words, I thought about the game character called 『Shade』.\nHuh? Had 『Shade』been 『Lycoris』’s step brother? No, no matter what, I think I’d remember if there was that sort of setup. So, this might be a development that became different from the game.\nThough, now that I think of it, I couldn’t remember『Shade』’s last name in the game entirely. That was not a problem of my memories or anything of that sort; in the game, he might not have used his own last name. Even in the character introduction, he was only introduced as 『Shade』... was how it felt like.\nI was hoping this was a development different from the game, yet, I didn’t have that conviction.\nOnce again, 『Shade』, was someone I fully realized was a character who spoke little about himself. Secretive characters were a pain!\nIndifferent to my confusion and raising his voice in loud repulsion, was Wolf.\n「You must be kidding! Lycoris got manipulated by him, you know!?」\nBecause that vigour was excessively strong, I thought to the extent that『Huh? If this conversation was setback because of Wolf’s objection, wouldn’t the aguish I suffered today be of waste?』 .\n「Of course. It would be different if Lycoris objects. And there’s also a problem that has to do with the court rank; frankly, as it is now, there are also other bothersome alternatives」\nFather’s, Wolf’s, then Shade’s glances collected towards me.\nSomehow, the matter on whether Shade will be welcomed to our house, seemed to rely on me. Give me a break.\n「... what does Shade want?」\nI was swayed by the adults who had their own various circumstances, however, comparatively, I swayed the surroundings from myself, the relative villain, to turn it around to my bothersome cousin.\n「I... don’t need the court rank. However...」\nShade hesitated to say it then refused to talk. But, at the very least, I knew he wasn’t opposed to this idea.\nEven if it was by a process of elimination, there probably wasn’t any other option for Shade but this.\n「How about your mother’s place...?」\n「Mother no longer has a place for me by her side」\nAah.\nSo it was like that. He already knew about it.\nThat the mother who handed him over to his father had already run away with another man.\nHe had already come to the point where he was unable to rely on either of his parents.\nShade was still considerably shorter than me, so when he lowered his head, the whorl of his head was the only thing I could see.\nIn connection to him having done so, I ended up recalling him quivering as he curled his body up in that attic room...\nAfter I’d been on the receiving end of his fascination magic, I’d thought that I’d absolutely never approach this guy again. Yet, in that escape drama, I’d come into contact with the weakness that Shade had been hiding away.\nI gave Wolf a side-long glance. He had on a sulky expression, he must’ve probably known what I was thinking. Moving just my lips, I conveyed the words『sorry about this』to him.\n「Oh yeah, which reminds me, Shade. First, as a condition, you’ve got to ask to have your magic sealed by the association」\nTo my words, Shade clicked his tongue with a “tsk” and promptly scowled at me.\n「What’s with that face? Isn’t that obvious? After all, even if Father was fine with it, I’m not」\n「... for me, this power is my lifeline」\n「But, you can’t even control that magic, can you?」\n「............」\n「Well, I understand your anxiety, but if you come with me and Father, you’ll be given a new power」\nShade resolutely pulled a suspicious look.\n「A new power... was it?」\n「Right. That is, you see... knowledge and... skill!」\n*Do~n*.\nI had planned to say some good things, but, Shade’s objection had little hope for it.\n「Are you actually saying that mundane thing is equivalent to the power I’ll lose?」\nMaking it sound like I was a fool, I huffed indignantly.\n「Far from being equivalent, you’ll be hiding away an even more magnificent potential. Let’s say you escape from here today and used that magic as much as you like from now on, who’s to say you won’t make another disaster like what you did to Crinum? If you run away from the association, you won’t be able to study in that magic academy, you know?」\nShade kept silent on the matter without objection, however, he did whisper in retaliation.\n「... quarrelsome woman」\n「What was that!? I’ve got to say this to you, you’ve been underestimating women way too much for a while now. You’ve been thinking something like『once I show a slightly sorrowful face or a smiling one, it’s a cinch』, haven’t you? It’s extremely irritating!」\n「That’s false accusation, you know」\n「As if. You’re definitely faking it. Thinking something like『The Great Angelic Me is the best~』! (4) With that, since there’s no proper opponent to be faced, if anyone was going to be the favorite to win, it would be this effeminate man who can’t even flat-out express love!」\n「...honestly, isn’t this false accusation?」\n「Huh, getting angry? I hit the mark, didn’t I?」\nIt was at this moment that we glared each other at close range.\n*pan**pan*\nFacing the sound of clapping, we saw Father with a wide grin on his face.\n「The two of you seem to get along exceedingly well」\nWolf approached us in silence and, continuing without a word, pulled my hand, distancing me far away from Shade.\nThus, having been alone in my family, this became a matter in which the members of family increased.\n(1) It isn’t directly implied, but I guess it’s the rejection from Shade’s magic and the confusion of the current situation...\n(2) He said “boku” when he referred to himself here... he’s trying to act like a cute kid...\n(3) He reverted to his normal way of speaking...\n(4) One more translation would be “The Magnificent Angelic Ore-sama is the best~”, how do you translate Ore-sama?",

      "content": "Family Arc – Lycoris and the Voluntary Service\nI’ve made the blunder of a lifetime.\nWhat was it about?\nIt was about the time when I was clinging to that girl, shivering and shaking like a leaf.\nAfter hearing about my real father through my mother, my life has been filled with troubles to the extent that it could be called a drama.\nBut no matter what kind of cheap drama this was, having the Duke’s Family take charge of the main character and having them all live happily ever after as the story’s conclusion might not be how the plot would go about being written. At the very least, the word『Duke』should not have been used.\nWhat’s more, of the five Duke families.\nIn this country, it was only those five families and no other family, whose influence shined radiantly if seen from the viewpoint of the masses.\nThe Duke of Lilia, Kaffir Radiata, was in fact, a person worthy of respect.\nTo be upfront, my real father, Narcissus Rankgerüste, in comparison, was not.\nInitially, for sure, I’d been vigilant against the impression of a crafty adult, however, he didn’t even have one unreasonable bone in him, he treated me the same way as he would his beloved daughter, Lycoris.\nI definitely have no intention of saying this out loud, but at the time that my mother told me 『you know, your father is an aristocrat』, his conduct was what I’d imagined my father to be.\nNo, more than imagination, it exceeded that of being considerably indulgent.\nAnd, supposed to be shining in the same influence was the duke’s daughter, Lycoris Radiata.\nAlthough even to me, her demeanor and conduct were as one would expect from the duke’s daughter, the things she says when she opens her mouth are all considerably frank. Having observed my real sister, Crinum, I had been under the impression that this was what an aristocrat’s sheltered daughter was supposed to be like. For that to be the exact opposite of her disposition astounds me even until this day.\nLycoris had reluctantly accepted the fact that I became her step brother, but now that I was attempting to start a new life, she already seemed just like a mother bird building a nest since she tirelessly tended to my affairs.\n「This is your room, right?」\n「This is yours. Including me and Father too, if someone comes in without permission, it’s fine to get angry at them」\nShe had gone out of her way to do this task of explaining it to me.\nThat is to say, she was trying to make it clear what my so called privileges are with regards to this family. I won’t say that it was her endeavor, in particular, that had borne the fruit, but, while not very much time had gone by, I felt like my own room in the duke’s house became a『place where I belonged』. At the very least, the room was much more than what was given in the Rankgerüste mansion.\nBut, having said that.\nThere’s no way I’d say that with this I’d reconcile with her – no, with that woman.\nThe first of that woman’s unforgivable acts was, for sure, coming to wake me up early in the morning.\nFor me, who had been accustomed to the night street’s life since I had been aware of my surroundings, a life sleeping from the rising sun had been the norm. Though if that time was compared to the life sleeping at night that one gets accustomed to, I was weak in the morning.\nThat woman did it – roaring mercilessly close to my ear, tearing off my futon without exception; one time, I ended up dropping from the bed along with my futon. An apology immediately followed, but since there was laughter in her voice, I won’t let her off for this.\nIn addition, she’s been forcing me to eat breakfast without fail.\nWhen I refused to eat, she’d have a smug look on her face, saying:\n『That’s the reason why even though so much time has passed, you’re still skinny, you know. Although your arm is much more slender than mine, what’s with that – are you proud of it?』\nDo you think there would be a possibility that I would be?\nThe second of that woman’s unforgivable acts was, the fact that she keeps tricking me into doing things using that eloquent mouth of hers.\nThat woman – she kept bringing up the time she helped me after my father got mad that one time in the Rankgerüste mansion, saying things like, 『even though you were really cute then』 or『if you can’t sleep at night, I can read you a book』, as she had come to tease me with. I already feel like I had no chance of winning with words against this fellow. Honestly, the fact that I requested aid from this girl, earning me a blunder at that time, had been regrettable.\nEven now, this was still the case.\n「Voluntary service – how about it?」\nHaving personally heard the completely out-of-character words, I’d attempted resistance just in case.\n「Well, I don’t have any interest in it. If you ask me, who is of commoner origin, I’d say things like these are a nobles’ deceits」\n「Yeah yeah. But among the group of children invited today, I’d imagine they wouldn’t know such a word as 『deceit』. Just with a candy or a meal, they’d be happy, you know. Well – they are pure. Unlike you」\n「I dislike children」\n「Because you’re a child yourself?」\nThis was exactly what I mean.\nIn the end, somehow or the other, having been tricked into this, I ended up being the attendant assigned to handle those misbehaving brats.\nAs for that woman, she was attempting to get a group of children to learn manners even just a little through an absoluteee~ly useless endeavor. Although it was only to train them how to properly use a napkin, as far as the children were concerned, the likes of using the beautiful napkins was probably more inconceivable than using their own clothes. Even as they were told that it was okay to dirty the napkins, they were all but bewildered.\nFrom the beginning, a birthplace and even an upbringing would make a difference as heaven and earth for humans, for them to try to surround the only dining table was itself a mistake.\nHaving these sardonic thoughts, I gazed in that direction; whatever Lycoris was thinking, with a pure, spotless white napkin, she straight out wiped the face of a child who had dirtied the corner of his mouth the most.\nAlthough the white napkin had tragically turned dirty, she reassured them and smiled, this was how it was to be used, she directed.\nThereafter the children mimicked her actions, instead of their clothes, they used a napkin to wipe their mouths and hands.\nFor some reason or another, as I watched, I carried an unsatisfied feeling within me.\n–to tell you the truth.\nFor my body, the habit of waking up early in the morning, had already been indelibly ingrained.\nIn the morning, I feel slightly awake from hearing the noisy chirps of the birds and, though my eyes still did not open, due to the aroma of the freshly-baked bread, my stomach will grumble in hunger. A little bit more after that and she’d probably come, I think at the back of my head.\nWhether it was somehow my body’s calculating way. Or whether the surrender to the duke family’s tranquil life quickened this much, it was to the extent that I felt tamed.\nAll of a sudden, with my eyebrows narrowing my field of vision, was a child, who had consumed more than enough portions of the meal for a small body, running up to Lycoris. It was the child whose face she’d wiped earlier on.\nThe small child, who was difficult to identify as a girl or a boy even by looking, also had the audacity to blush while looking up at Lycoris. With Lycoris bending down to match the child, it frantically made some kind of conversation with her.\n「ーーーーBig sister Lycoris～～～～」\nThe brat probably didn’t properly understand the difference in social position, calling Lycoris, “big sister”, without a care.\n「Rather, she’s not\nyour\nbig sister, right?」\nThe words that were only murmured surprisingly reverberated across the large dining hall; After she’d looked in my direction with surprise, whether it was a look of happiness or of craftiness, she grinned broadly.\nI’ve made the blunder of a lifetime.\nFiri: Hi guys, Family Arc is now over. Now off to the next volume. But may I know, did anyone buy the second LN?\nI want to see the images so badly. Would anyone like to share the images with me? I don’t need the entire book, but I do want to see the pretty pictures. As a trade off, I’ll upload the first chapter earlier, IF, I see all the pictures. Well you could also donate for this hobby of mine, and I can buy it myself... hihihi.\ntldr; I’m shamelessly begging. Give me pictures = Faster updates. It will definitely drive me to translate even faster.",

      "content": "School Arc – Chapter 1\nThe waiting room for the imperial matches, which doubles as the welcome party for the new students, was brimming with excitement.\nParticularly for the students aspiring to be knights, who were now rejoicing at the results of their matches.\nNonetheless, maybe the reason the tension in the air feels somewhat weak was because, at the end of the day, it was for the sake of a school function. Or, since the champion and the runner-up champion was almost decided, it could be that taking it easy was the manifestation of the sentiment.\n「Wolf. Shade.」\nCalling out to the two who were in an area far back, my fiance was the first to look over his shoulder.\n「Lycoris」\nThose purple eyes smiled gently.\nHaving remarkably matured in these last few years, not only had Wolf’s body structure become taller, he became tougher as a whole, even when compared to the the muscular students gathered in this place, his difference from the rest was striking.\nSince I had to look up at him when talking even though I was fairly tall for a girl, I understood the value of the time we’d first met, when I could look down just a little at him.\nThough he had quite well-organized features, ever since growing up, people often talked about a sharp, discerning image when talking about him. Since Wolf’s almond pupils had an impressively vivid color, with his hair and even his clothes centered around black, I believe, owing to that, a misunderstanding of some sort occurred. Because matters where he omitted his facial expressions when appearing in public and the like were many, his handsome face ended up giving a sagacious impression to others.\n「Elder sister. Even at a place like this, are you planning to give your encouragement by slapping this cute little brother of yours on the butt?」\nPleasantly and light-heartedly smiling while saying uncute things, this little brother through mysterious circumstances, nowadays really resembled Father in my opinion. Rather than saying it was his features, it was more of his behavior that resembled him. Well, even though it wasn’t his real father, since they had a blood relation, it wasn’t really that strange though.\nNevertheless, speaking about this smiling face. This was the sort of expression which, when I squint slightly at it, could probably pass exactly for my father’s.（Father was a bit baby-faced）\nThough the hair color that settled in could no longer be branded as gold as compared to when he was a child, part of his quirky hair, when exposed to light, still sparkled and glimmered. Coupled with the whiteness of his skin as the center of a glamorous impression and his deep reddish-brown eyes being of a prominent dark color, he was hugely popular with charming young ladies who had commented, 「I end up wanting to take a look」, or「it’s mysteriously dreamy, for some reason」.\nAlthough when standing next to Wolf, he had a sense of slenderness, Shade also winded up having a solidly-built, manly physique. That is to say, he wasn’t cute.\n「Since I probably can’t watch the outcome of the game, I thought to give my support right now」\nBecause my seat was in a conspicuous location, I’d probably be exposed anyway, so I came here to tell them in advance.\n「Did something happen?」\nSince Wolf immediately let out a concerned voice, I shook my head in denial.\n「I just wanted to check something for a bit. I’m already used to seeing Wolf’s and Shade’s bouts, so in that time, I’ll finish the errand」\n「Despite trying to raise the men’s morale for their battle, your words seem to douse cold water. Elder sister」\n「”Because of that, since I was caught off guard, I couldn’t participate in the finals at all”, if you used such an excuse, you’ll be laughed at, you know. Shade」\nHaving fiercely and deliberately scowled at him, Shade faked an exaggerated expression of fright.\n「I’m sorry, Wolf. In the box seat, I really wanted to watch you beat Shade in the overall championship, but...」\n“You all treat me harshly”, though Shade wedged in that remark, it was ignored.\nIt’s not like a section of the female graduates threw a fit at the end because they didn’t want to part with Shade at the previous year-end; the riots which lasted until just before the start of the school term didn’t necessarily mean they were angry about it. Yeah, not at all.\n「I’m okay with it. But, are you sure there aren’t any problems?」\n「Yeah. I’ll go see how the underclassmen are doing, that’s all」\n「But, your face... isn’t it a bit pale?」\n「...yeah. As expected, I grew tired of sitting at that seat. It’s way too close to the direction of the royals, you know. Since the leaders of the school were with them, they weren’t concerned with doing things such as starting a conversation with me, but somehow, I ended up strangely tensed」\nWhen I conveyed the excuse I had prepared without hesitation, Wolf, at last, nodded his head consenting.\n「They’re really not horrible people」\n「But, that’s how you think because you’ve been going in and out of the royal palace since you were a child... ah geez, there’s not really much time left, I’ll be going then」\n「Alright. Give me a shout if something happens」\nWith our exchange, Shade started poking fun.\n「Ah- ah- you know, this is what I mean. I think Sir Knight’s side of being a worrywart has long since become abnormal, don’t you agree? In the midst of the matches that have the tight security of the attending royals, are you actually saying that something could happen?」\nAs Shade picked a quarrel, Wolf gave a wry smile. Shade sometimes intentionally calls Wolf a 『knight』to make fun of him.\n「Well then, my dark Lord Knight. Make sure to smite my evil little brother down, okay? And Shade, just be careful so that you don’t have any injuries. If even a cut grazed your face, the other person will be resented by your devotees, you know」\nI deliberately cracked a joke, then left the room.\nLike that, the battle commenced. The battle card of the last friendly match, was quite reasonably decided to be the favorite to win, Wolf, vs the rival candidate, Shade. (1)\nIn that circumstance, I quietly stood up from my seat.\n...although I said “quietly”, en route, 「where will you be heading?」and「just a bit more, and the most important match will begin」were dropped while I profusely troubled everyone about.\n「It’s a shame, but because I was asked for help by the teacher, I have to leave my seat for a bit. If it’s alright with you, please tell me how the match goes afterwards」, having informed them with a face showing admirable disposition, the ladies gave a look of great sympathy and with the caring words of「I understand 」 and「thanks for your hard work」, they sent me off.\nThe ladies, which were my peers and juniors, were fundamentally raised to be quite mild-mannered. Distrusting a person’s words was something they didn’t do... Their future is a little worrying. Though it would be good if they could be blessed with an honest spouse.\nDuring the time I was moving, I winded up attracting a bit of attention, however, once Wolf and Shade came into sight, the spectators’ gazes narrowed to one point in the stadium.\nMoving while avoiding the public eyes, I came closer to the freshmen’s seats.\nThe whistling sound announcing the start of the match, echoed high in the blue sky.\nAnd then, almost at the same time, Shade fired magic as a distraction. This very aspect of materializing flower petals was a playfulness so like Shade. Unfazed, Wolf subsequently showed how to magnificently cancel Shade’s attack.\nAlthough the match started with them messing around a little, the offense and defense after that were almost like scattering fireworks.\nAs Wolf ventured forward, he moved at lightning speed. Shade leapt backwards in order to evade. Wolf did not run after him. In the next moment, Shade broke into his opponent’s side and came advancing. Once again, Wolf elegantly warded him off, gaining distance.\nWhereas Shade dished out countless troublesome attacks, Wolf moved at critical moments. If it dragged on, Wolf would likely be declared the winner in the match’s development, but if one lost his focus even for a moment, either one could lose all the same.\nSometimes, there was a visiting silence while the pair glared at each other – a moment of equilibrium.\nThe audience watched with bated breaths.\nAmong them, was a young lady with hair of gold.\nShe watched the battle with her vivid emerald green eyes sparkling.\nFlushing with excitement, her cheeks were rose-colored. Her small lips pink.\nAlthough she wore a comparatively modest dress with a white and sky-blue theme, there was no way to conceal her loveliness.\nThis was no doubt, the game’s opening. It was a spectacle taken from that\nscene.\n(1) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)\nTL notes:\nBrought to you by the generous Hime Takamura, who was kind enough to share the wonderful pictures for volume 2. I must say, because of her generosity, this chapter got uploaded earlier.

Unfortunately, my JP editor is caught up in RL issues, so this chapter will have to make do unedited until she comes back. I got Este to help me edit some of the chapters I have right now, so thanks for him!\nI’ll try to upload more chapters this month as I promised.

      "content": "School Arc – Chapter 2\nBesides when we’re in our dormitories and when I’m taking classes for girls, I spend a lot of my time with Wolf.\nI see Shade frequently talking with other people regardless of gender, (his male to female ratio of company was 1:9), but when he notices us, he’ll approach before I know it.\nToday, for the sake of 『work』, the three of us planned to assemble one by one later.\nWhen I say work, it’s actually about the duties related to our dormitory positions. From the sixth years in their final year, both male and female dormitories have a single dorm prefect head – shortened to ‘dorm head’ – each. From the fifth years, two people each are chosen as prefects. Further down, the number of associate prefects aren’t clearly defined. With the dorm heads and the dorm prefects consulting together, the nomination of a number of people deemed essential was possible. As a custom, generally around ten or so people take up those jobs.\nWell in short, with the adolescent children who easily cause problems one way or another assembling within the dormitory, dividing the students into sections and making them an autonomous management was the intention of the school.\nIn fact, even though I say dorm head, usually, no work is imposed on that person. At best, once in a while, that person does things for the teachers; occasionally, that person would give a sermon paramount to saying「in order to not act shamefully as students of this glorious royal magical academy」for an event.\nIf I had to say, it’s the prefects who serve as the dorm heads’ helpers that were hectic. Because, since I also served that role last year, I knew that as a fact.\nToday was a few tasks of the dorm heads — this day, to give a sermon of example at the opening assembly, Wolf and I were scheduled to go up the platform.\n「Shade, don’t you have something you need to do?」\nShade was also appointed as a dorm prefect this year.\n「Thing is, the other prefect is incredibly diligent」\n「Is that why you’ve pushed all the work to that person?」\n「The performance is much better like this than when it’s the two of us. That person... and I, something like attaining cooperation is probably impossible」\nI glanced at Wolf with my eyes, however, it looks like he doesn’t have any desire to interrupt the conversation on Shade’s way of speaking. Wolf is pretty laissez-faire about his subordinates. Maybe the way men interact with their superiors and subordinates is just different.\nShade and the other prefect, to tell you the truth, don’t get along exceptionally well. Although it wasn’t to the extent that it was put out in the open, I have yet to see them make cordial conversation.\nI’d love to say ‘Then don’t put the two of them together then.’ but it’s the school that elects the dorm prefects. Let’s just overlook the fact that parentage is a major factor on who they elect.\n「Yesterday I ran around doing the lion’s share of the work, so for today at least, it should be fine to leave it to him」\nApparently, the two male prefects divide their work up instead of cooperating.\nThe freshmen’s dormitory registration started from a week ago and roughly ended yesterday. In that week, the degree of various pressing issues had been hectic enough to faint, but from today onwards, with the start of class work, a little of the burden was supposed to decrease. Once the semester begins, which homeroom teachers are taking care of which students become clearly defined, and so the dorm leader and dorm prefects can just push all the woーーentrust the students to their respective teachers.\nThe sound of light footsteps drifted in. Even if it was considered a little improper, I wanted to give them leeway today. After all, the girls are busy.\nThe two female dorm prefects; in other words, the two who were being forced to be my gofers, ran hurriedly towards me.\n「Onee-sama, we’ve finished checking the students roster! 」\n「Although we’ve already gone to see the new students, at present, there isn’t any child complaining to be in bad shape. We’ve told them to stay quiet while you and Wolfgang-sama are talking!」\nDon’t misunderstand.\nThem calling me Onee-sama isn’t because of\nMaria Watches Over Us\n. It’s because of a tradition within the female dormitory.\nNaturally, it isn’t imposed or anything, and the girls who are too embarrassed to do it just call me Lycoris-senpai. But there are also plenty of girls who are happy to play along.\nBack while I was a prefect as well, a number of my underclassmen girls called me “Onee-sama”, so over the last year I got used to this ‘shame play’. (1) These days I can return their greeting without so much as a stiff smile.\n「（\nAlthough I want them to quietly listen to the school chairman’s talk as well,\n）thank you. This one week was really hectic, but once this ceremony is finished, there will be time to relax, won’t there? Good work. You’ve been doing very well」\nThe two wore lovely, shy smiles, looking happy as they bowed their head; for some reason or another, I moved my body in order to conceal that from Shade’s eyes.\nEither one of these two was meant to become the next year’s dormitory head, but I’m thinking there wouldn’t be a problem even if I left it to them right now. The two were both extraordinarily diligent – they were girls who spared no effort.\nHowever, these girls don’t usually come near me too much.\nEven now, I’d only just said it since they had finished their report to me, but with a position a little far away, the two settled down and had ended up starting their own pleasant conversation.\nAlthough I don’t want to admit it.\nIn this school, I’m relatively alone.\nIt didn’t mean I was bullied. It’s not like they ignore me when I’m talking, and when we make any kind of group during class and I ask “can I join?”, I don’t get rejected.\nHowever, I don’t have any friends that I’m constantly, on a routine basis, together with.\nTo me, this had a big reason.\nFive years ago. When I entered into this academy, I met a female student called Solana Brugmansia. (2) Brugmansia was one of the five duke families, and she had been the dorm head in those days.\nI’d already known the other person’s name for some time now, but it looked like it was also the same in her case.\nHaving personally been called out by her, that was all it took to whirl me up. Rich pink-blonde and soft brown pupils, the lady-like her who was already elegant with every move she made, looked like a princess to me.\nIt was my first time having an older-sister figure, but once I tried talking to her, I realized she was a little absent-minded – how do I put it, she was the sort of person you simply couldn’t leave alone.\nAnd so, under her patronage, I began adapting quite smoothly into dormitory life. Especially with the start of the school term, even more than the magic lessons, a lot of etiquette lessons on the school grade’s hierarchical structure ( The underclassman watched to learn the ways of her senior. The senior noticing her underclassman’s gaze, occasionally, offers guidance) was also attained, as a lot of the time was spent together with her.\nWith the combination of both genders, it was set that Wolf would join me in the magical study-classroom lectures which was a lesson for the other grade in school.\nAnd so, after a short time passed, when I had time to look over my surroundings belatedly, I had a realization.\nGroups that got along well had already been formed!!\nI ended up missing out on it.\nIf this was all thus far, I still had the option to enter one of the existing groups. I discussed the considerations with Solana-sempai, the Onee-sama, that for the time being, I was going to be try to fit in with the children in the same year – don’t take it the wrong way – and thus changing my lifestyle of clinging to her.\nHowever.\nShe... was extensively indulgent. She went around to help behind the scenes, giving out instructions 『You’re going to invite Lycoris-chan for lunch』and『You’re going to invite her into the group work』 to all the girls in the same year.\nAnd as expected, of course, I noticed as well. I mean, they invited me to lunch on rotation after all.\nWhen I realized it, I wanted to dig a hole and bury myself. Even if I thought about it now, honestly speaking, I should be glad they didn’t start to bully me instead.\nAnd afterwards, well – after giving my spirit a good pounding, I had them stop that bothersome rotation and planned on improving our relationship bit by bit, but, the results were lacking. I don’t think Lycoris had actual friends in the game either, so perhaps this is already what you’d call destiny.\nBy sense of self-examination and restraint, I treated Solana-sempai as a 『senior』all throughout; but, I spent the two years visiting when there were invitations sent out by her.\nContinuing after Solana-sempai, who served as the dormitory head, graduated, I had also served as a quasi-prefect and dormitory prefect as we went up the grades. That being the case, through the involvement of work, the chances of speaking with children of the same year also increased, gradually, the distance seemed to shorten. Although that were so, I was in a standstill since by no means could this also be called an affable relationship. Personally, I’m going through busy days because of a particular troublesome junior.\nBy the way, in Wolf’s case, actual friends came in better than in my case. Or perhaps I should say, he was sort of a little bit surrounded? Once in a while, it would become a conversation where he’d point out 「Aren’t those what you’d call a conversation between a boss and his subordinates?」, but the situation looked like companions joking around and making fun of each other. How enviable.\nAmong the three of us, it was Shade who was remarkably sociable. Although it looked like girls were fundamentally the only ones he talked to, I’ve also seen him talk to guys about stupid things. Well – it didn’t necessarily mean I knew what the contents of the conversations were, but, it sort of had the atmosphere of being stupid. It was definitely a conversation of the sort that ends up quickly stopping once a female student approached.\nBy the way, that Solana-sempai, just before graduating from school, left an inconceivable bomb.\nIt was a timed bomb, a bit later, it exploded, greatly surprising me.\nThis was what she said before leaving school.\n『By next year, my brother will be coming here to enter the academy. Since my youngest brother is far apart in age, with everyone in the household doting on him, he ended up developing a little bit of a selfish personality... I’m worried. Lycoris, if you could, take care of my brother, okay?』\nAnd so, on the preceding year’s entrance ceremony.\nCame his arrival. Yellow’s, that is.\nNo, pardon me. The arrival was that of Arutad Brugmansia.(3)\nOne of the capturable characters of the『standard game』- the image character Yellow was a simple-minded idiot-class of yandere.\nFor him, rather than『imbecile』, 『idiot』 is more appropriate in my opinion.(4)\n(1) Este says it kinda means sexual play...\n(2) Solana Brugmansia. Solana was a name taken from Solanaceae.\n(3) Arutad Brugmansia. It’s another poisonous flower. Flip the name of Arutad, and you get Datura. I feel so smart now... though the spelling is Arutad, the pronunciation is “Arutado”.\n(4) She’s trying to weaken the term stupid saying that oh well he’s not an imbecile(insult to a worse degree), just an idiot.(lower level of insult).",

      "content": "School Arc – Chapter 3\nArutad Brugmansia was – a glamorous handsome blonde youth. With huge, light brown doe-like eyes, he was a lump of charm. His feelings show up on his face immediately.\nHis nickname was Art. Though the game users appointed the nickname 『Bakalt』. 『Baka』+『Art』+『Cult』, with that, it was 『Bakalt』.(1)\nWhy ‘cult’ was in it, was because inside the game, Art’s entourage would just follow his directions no matter how silly or inhumane of an act it was.『Do they do it even with logic?』『No, these were already fanatics, and you should probably call it as it is』, thus, it seemed this nickname marked an end to that debate.\n『Art』was extraordinarily hedonistic, he didn’t have sufficient self-control. Although, he was remarked as an idiot, strangely enough, he also had a clever side. To say the least, excelling at manipulating people was worrying.\nInside the game, whether it was planning for a party, dressing someone up, dressing fashionably himself, or even supporting love, he would do it for the fun of it. Gambling, taking drugs, bullying, and killing small animals were also the same things to him.\nThe first time I met him, I recalled him from inside the game and thought, 『it’s over』. In front of such a fearsome opponent, there was nothing else I could do.\nThe unique thing about Art, among all the capturable characters, was that a serious past wasn’t even alluded to. Even in that area, he was said to be an idiot type as well. In fact, both his parents are in good health and it seems not even a rift was there, the youngest child of the six siblings held a somehow heartwarming setting. Well, he might have turned weird from being spoiled too much at present, though.\nAt any rate, there wasn’t even a trauma he had to overcome. If this was about his self-restraint, it could be a matter of how he could be endowed with it. Like embedding a microchip into his brain.\nFortunately, though, I honestly don’t know whether to say if it was good or not.\nArt was a boy who was terribly picky with people. Since I’m the daughter of a duke, he listens to the things that I, his senior, says well enough.\nBut, even though I say he listens, it was to the extent where he’d feel inclined to return a response like「eh~~」 or 「don’t wanna」 to my scoldings. Though not quite satisfactory, since the notion called the hierarchical system got into his head, I was treated as the boss.\nI put it upon myself. Without fail, I decided that this crafty, tyrannical child had to be domestica– educated.\nThat was meant as a joke.\nAt least, for Art, it was certain he thought people who held more authority than him had to restrain him some way or another. There was the matter of Solana-sempai’s request for help and, fortunately for me, a dependable fiance and a little brother was there too.\nSolana-sempai = the effort from Art’s home. After a long journey returning home, it looks like she surrounded Art and persuaded him. Telling him, 「if you listen to what Lycoris-chan says, you won’t go wrong. If there’s anything worrying you, go consult it with her」\nNo, that was pretty troublesome though, sempai.\nLeaving the child’s education to the school’s hands, much less, to a single student’s, was a practice I’d really like to end.\nIt was that very Art, who rushed over after seeing us from a distance, coming into view.\nTaking his entourage along with him in droves.\nAnd then, speaking to me.\n「Long time no see~ Lady Boss. Were you lonely without me?」\n「............」\nBak... Art uses the nickname「Boss」 even with Wolf. In his head, dorm leader = boss, it seemed. Incidentally, he referred to Shade as『Sempai』.\n「... haven’t I asked you repeatedly to stop with that way of calling?」\n「Why not? It’s spot on, isn’t it?」\n「If you keep something like that up until you reach the high society of the royal court, I’ll have to use everything I can to drive you to stop, won’t I...?」\nMy grudge was muffled out by a somewhat frightened Art,「It’s not like I meant anything bad by it. Right guys?」, he said, talking to his entourage behind him. Moreover, the simultaneously nodding entourage was a lot of five people today. The breakdown of which was two guys and three girls.\nArt’s entourage, which sometimes increases, decreases, or swaps people, fundamentally didn’t approach us to talk. They’d only meet our gaze and lower their head. ‘Was there even some kind of agreement going around here?’, which at first I doubted, but it seems there\nwas\nan agreement. I don’t even get it.\nOnly one person amongst the members talks to us when necessary – a boy. As Art’s male cousin, he was almost regularly at Art’s side. You could probably call him a watchdog, but I don’t believe he was actually carrying out that role. He simply watches after all.\n「In the first place, why did you come here, Art?」\n「Eh?」\n「You’re only a fourth year, you’re not a dorm prefect yet. Go stand in the students’ line!」\n「I’m a quasi-prefect, you know!」\n「I know, but... we’re fine without the quasi-prefects coming here today」\n「Don’t wanna! I wanna be here too!」\n「I can’t give just you special treatment you know...」\n「Why?」\nSee here.\nI was seized by exhaustion.\nHe didn’t understand the reason why he’s not being given special treatment.\nHe didn’t know why we’re ending a fun thing like this.\nAt such a time, Art faced us and asked『Why?』. The difference with those words compared to when a small child was asking because he wanted to know, was that there was irritation involved. 『Up till now I’ve been excused for everything I did, so why won’t you guys excuse me?』was the sort of irritation he had though.\nEvery time I heard this, I pondered. For three years, I’ve watched him from relatively up close. But I honestly couldn’t understand him even a little bit, could I? The belief that we’d become a little friendly as we talked – wasn’t that nothing more than just my delusion? I mean, as proof of that, didn’t he just go as far as to question my reasonable words with a『why』?\nI was still stumped on how to reply, when Wolf and Shade drove the sulky Art off, sending him back to his seat. The group following him from behind was, as always, completely silent.\nI heaved out a sigh.\nAnd right then, I noticed the faint scent of drifting agarwood.\n「Pardon the delay」\nPolitely saying it in that fashion and lowering his head in a beautiful gesture was Ru Xiang.(2) The owner of this agarwood scent.\nMatching his movements, his straight, glossy black hair swayed. His unique hairstyle, which was cut in a way so as to put layers at the side of his face, suited him quite well. Just by him being there, it was like a one-of-a-kind world had been created. His white clothes of slightly unusual construct was delicately embroidered with a silver thread. A young boy with an exotic air around him.\nWell, it’s troubling whether the term “young boy” that I ended up saying was enough. Wolf and Shade were already clearly endowed with physiques of young boys, in spite of this and in comparison, Ru Xiang was slender. Though, with a tall, slim figure and a perpetual serene smile, it was evident that he was transitioning from a young boy to a young man.\nAfter Ru Xiang reported the students’ situation to Wolf, he very quietly entered into our circle.\nHe was another one of the dormitory prefects. And, another one of the game’s capturable characters as well.\nHis birthplace was unclear even within the school. A person of particular noble character had been the only explanation provided.\nInside the game, there was a scene where 『Ru Xiang』talked about his mother. Saying, she was a degenerate. An extreme woman. A person who concealed all her wants. A person who had been referred to as decline and destruction.\nHe had a strong complex towards women. He considered loving their womanhood, not just about sexual desire, but even as far as simple attachments, as vile. Having a partiality towards inorganic substances which didn’t have desires, when he became troubled with a fondness towards the heroine, immediately, he went as far as to consider killing her while she was still beautiful. However, with all his might, he never acted on it.\nHe had been the only character inside the game who truly didn’t give off a violent aura. The sick part of him – the quick aggressiveness – never did materialize. The only time his route turned bizarre, was when he made a remark to the heroine saying 『the things that you like, I want it gone』. Even with that, since his route was gentle even for a story, no matter what choices were picked, the heroine does not get killed nor does anyone else die for that matter. At least, none as far as I remember.\nThe Ru Xiang in front of me right now was an earnest student.\nEnthusiastic to learn, well-mannered, and a firm protector of the law. Even though there were times his earnest side clashes with Shade when they don’t meet a compromise, there wasn’t a situation wherein he held a grudge against me, whom was that guy’s older sister.\nEven now, he lightheartedly called me 「Lycoris-sempai」.\nBut then.\nI probably shouldn’t be off guard.\nThe heroine — 『Lily』 had appeared in school, which means, the time of the game had begun.\n(1) BAKA + ARUTO + KARUTO = BAKARUTO.\nI thought of something to westernize it: Dolt + Alto + Cult = Dault. But let’s stick to Japanese so I don’t go off.\n(2) Ru Xiang(瑞香) : his name is taken from the flower of Daphne.",

      "content": "School Arc – Chapter 4\nSince all the members were present, we headed to the auditorium where we’d be conducting the assembly.\nWhen we went in through the door, the noisy students swiftly turned silent. Though I could feel the burden of the gaze of attention from all sides well enough, I was accustomed to it.\nIt’s not important but...\nI wonder why I always imagine what it would be like if I did something silly in this atmosphere. For example, If I let out a strange cry, or if I seemingly fell down on purpose, I wonder what would happen.\nIt’s not as if I want to die socially, but I don’t want to be coldly looked at by the whole school either.\nAh, of course, I’d never once acted on it.\nTo begin with, since I was walking hand in hand with Wolf, even if I fall down, I have the feeling I’d only be held in his arms.\nThe magical academy insists on gender being impartial as the scholastic front, but at the same time, it was also a place where the nobilities’ female children were taught lessons on manners. That’s why, it’s only natural that the female students were escorted.\nIncidentally, dancing lessons were a combination of men and women.\nRather than embarrassing, I’d say that it was something I’d pretty much gotten used to.\nRegardless of whether it was done by habit, in that『situation』, for me, it was Wolf’s trait of walking half a step behind me that was, if anything, awkwardly embarrassing.\nA good wife? Is Wolf a good\nwife\n?\nWell, I know this was a part of his overprotectiveness though!\nWhile thinking of that trivial matter, we arrived on the platform.\nThe assembly proceeded smoothly.\nGiven that Wolf had practically told them everything regarding『knowledge as part of being a royal magical academy student』 prior to this, I faced the students of the same year as me, saying「spend the remaining one year of school life treasuring it so as not to regret it」, and to the lower year students, saying 「the times you can enjoy school life will be over in just a blink of an eye. Work hard everyday and see through what you must do」 and delivered the greeting without problems.\nAnd then, when my face ultimately looked up, my eyes drew to the rear column of students.\nShe was there.\n『Lily』.\nI think it was good that it happened after I finished my speech.\nEven though I knew in my head that she was at this school, every time I saw her, I’d end up shaken. Although I returned to the stage seat wearing a nonchalant face, my mind was not far from her.\nThe game heroine appearing in the school meant that the game has started.\nThat, in some sense, meant the tragedy was starting. If I had to give an example, it’s the same thing as a detective appearing at his designated scene in a mystery novel.\nThe characters of the game will end up falling sickly in love with her. (1)\nOf course, they had the makings for it, or perhaps I should say, it was because they were somewhat unstable to begin with. But, for sure, by falling in love, the negative emotions such as jealousy, possessiveness, and anxiety swelled and burst. If I put it in another way, by loving the heroine too much, they ended up becoming strange.\nHowever, at the same time, her existence also offered a saving grace.\nIn the game, divergences existed. In other words, by selecting good options, the story would struggle on to reach a happy ending. As for the darkness in their hearts, the heroine had a wonderful development to clear it. The people around them also didn’t die. The heroine didn’t die either. With even the hero not dying, this became a happy ending for all three assembled.\nI needed to make sure of the situation. At least, I need only to avoid the trap of the abnormally wide variety of bad endings. I can’t afford to have anyone die on me.\nI had to make sure of what I must do\nso as not to regret it\n. Strangely, these were the words I had said earlier.\nWhat was about to happen depended on the heroine’s choices. But, be that as it may, even\nI\ncan’t stand and watch without doing something.\nI wonder what kind of future she’ll aim for. I wonder who she’ll love.\nWhat if that person was Wolf?\nI wonder what I’d do. Would I fight her? Would it be\nokay\nto fight her?\nWould I have it in me to say that\nthat\nroute would lead to a path towards happiness?\nHonestly, that likelihood might possibly be the very thing I fear the most.\n(1) That is, end up yandere for her.",

      "content": "School Arc – Chapter 5\nAlthough it wasn’t strange since we were in the same school, I instantly met her face-to-face.\nSince lessons on manners were carried out by combining all the school year levels, she and I came to be in the same class. Even in the game, this had been so.\nSince there had been no alterations in the previous year, I could recognize the members coming from the second year until the sixth year simply by sight. Continuing after the freshmen, it was Lily who began her self-introduction.\n「I’m Lilium Valley. Please – kindly take care of me」(1)\nHer gesture of bowing was even clumsier than the first year students’. The fact that she was a commoner was well-known by almost everyone in the entire school.\nHer voice, which I’d heard for the first time, fit the impression a little when matched with her charming appearance. Even while her greeting was clumsy, it was easy to follow; I somehow managed to breathe again.\nThe subject of the first day’s etiquette lessons was determined by the newcomers’ greeting etiquette.\nAlthough already well beyond the years and having a tensely-strained back, the etiquette teacher would speak gently when talking about greetings in regards to manners. Things such as not to carelessly talk when other people are giving their introduction, and, after giving a reminder on the very basic parts concerning things like the introduction’s procedures, it was brought to a close with the most important point – to constantly bear in mind not to allow ourselves to have unpleasant thoughts towards other people.\nEven though there are also people who put out students’ every single move as hopeless among the etiquette teachers, this teacher’s lessons were popular with the students for being somewhat gentle. Of course, there might be some significance to those strict coachings, but, for me to also think 『I want to be a woman like that』 meant I was holding this teacher’s methods in high esteem.\n「The accumulation of day-to-day effort gives birth to beautiful actions. Observe your upperclassmen’s ways closely and use them as reference, okay? Especially since Miss Dormitory Head is also in this class」\nAnd so, I ended up feeling the pressure when I considered those kind words.\nOf course, since I can’t disregard it, while chanting in my mind 『don’t rush it, do it slowly』, I picked up the hem of my dress and with a 「I’ll work hard to meet your expectations」, I gave my thanks.\nWhat happened after what was, so to speak, a『mock introduction』 and 『mock greeting』 .\nI believe another purpose for this was to ease the new students’ nervousness, and it seemed to be successful with that. Every girl seemed to be having fun – with this slightly embarrassing game of pretend, they were enjoying themselves.\nThe girls don’t know. Although this teacher was a person who never loses that Buddha-like smile, this person’s own expectations for us just continues to become higher and higher. I will never forget about being made to do pseudo-weight training everyday for『the sake of beautiful actions』. Ah, no, I respect this person. Really.\nIt wasn’t limited to this person, but, for the etiquette teacher, she can’t help but think of pumping blood through means that were fundamentally athletic-oriented.\nWith the likes of what was called my pensiveness concluding at an appropriate point, I tried to participate in the lessons as well.\nIt was a little around that time.\nAt a short distance away from where I and the teacher were, several people raised their voices in laughter.\nIn this lesson, we were to greet our fellow companions as we were setting up the common desks with a 「Nice to meet you」.\nThat was certainly a spectacle that would invite laughter. In fact, I did hear some who couldn’t hold back their giggles.\nBut at that time, somehow or other, the laughter seemed to have been coloured with contempt for someone. I ended up concealing my unintentional frown after hearing such a laugh. For that reason, my feet directed me there.\nAt the destination I walked to, was a golden-haired young girl — Lily, who was looking troubled with her head hanging down.\n「You are terribly unused to bowing, aren’t you. How strange」\nThe person that had said this was in the same year as Lily, one of the fifth year students. Talking as if remembering a funny joke, it wasn’t clear whether or not she held ill will towards the person herself.\nBut for the girls in the same group who’d ended up bursting out laughing once more so as to follow her lead, this was definitely a composition of bullying.\nBefore the laughter spread around, I thought I had to stop it.\n「If」, I began a little louder than usual.\n「... if, being inexperienced is something to be laughed about, then I suppose every one of us will surely be mocked in high society after this, won’t we?」\nSaying this, I dropped my gaze, with my head slightly lowered.\nThough the words I spoke were unmistakably my true feelings, when I made eye contact with the girl that spoke, my gaze was capable of forcing out an apology. Even without that, I wanted to believe that she’d come to understand.\nSince, so long as there wasn’t any special reason, the magical academy students were to exit into high society after the school graduation, holding unease towards the unknown had to be the same for everyone.\n「U-uhm... I... I-I’m sorry!」\nFortunately, starting with her, the girls who had laughed at Lily competed frantically in order to begin apologizing. With a flash of relief, I smiled at those girls; they even sent an apology in my direction. They weren’t bad girls at heart.\nWith the intention of appearing nonchalant as I glanced at Lily’s situation, which had been on my mind, eyes of fresh verdure met mine.\nWhat a marvel it was, the look on her face was fascinating.\nIf I don’t include Wolf or Shade, it was fair to say that I almost never receive such a sincere glance from another person. It was probably because of that.\n「Come now, everyone, don’t forget that we’re in the middle of our lessons」\nWith the teacher’s calm, though resolute voice, the classroom’s atmosphere returned back to normal. However, the following words, no matter how soothing to the heart it seemed, couldn’t stop the blow.\n「Oh, that’s right. Perhaps it would be a good idea for Miss Lilium to be instructed by Miss Dormitory Head for a while?」\nThe teacher smiled broadly in such a way as if struck with a good idea.\nThat sort of development wasn’t even in the game though!?\n(1) Her name comes from Lily of the Valley.",

      "content": "School Arc – Chapter 6\nAs expected, Lily was an existence that noticeably stood out inside the school.\nNot even a day had passed after our lessons in manners, and I’d gotten to hear that name of hers once more.\nBy evening of that day, the school was already brimming with rumours about her.\n『I heard she broke the magic measuring instrument, I’ve never heard of it happening before』\nThere were those that felt agitated, and those that felt skeptical. Given that sentiments were varied, it seems that interest was not short on tales about Lily learned through hearsay.\nSometimes, the students in the same year, acting as eye-witnesses on that matter, add in new information about her. It was almost like that of a Chinese Whisper game, where the details were twisted, fragmented, or blown out of proportion.\n『If those were true, it’d be terrible, wouldn’t it?』\nWhen I heard that muttered, I frowned.\nTherein lies the problem.\nThe magic in this world was not caused by beseeching a miracle through existences like a spirit or a god. It’s from an invisible power circulating inside the user’s own body.\nIt wasn’t an almighty power that could do everything – the way this power manifested was greatly dependent on its suitability to each individual.\nFor example, Shade displayed strong suitability for magic that acted on the mind when he started with fascination magic.\nWolf, himself, was good at body-strengthening and offense-type magic. Since his career aspiration was to succeed his father, Duke Ranuncula, if this materialized, it would give birth to a combat-fanatic prime minister.\nAs for me, if I were to classify broadly, I’d be in the same mind manipulation category as Shade. But, my absolute forte in magic was strengthening my own memory. In other words, it wasn’t anything scary, it was only magic used for the likes of memorizing for an exam. Although it was certainly convenient, it was also certainly plain.\nAt any rate, though each person’s magic varied greatly, there was one common feature. That was, that『one won’t have magic strong enough to exceed the expectations of the Association』.\nThe Association was, by nature, a group that conducted magical research, even now, that was still a strong part of it. Within its long history, having contributed to organizing a great variety of magic, I heard they were able to roughly understand the boundaries of magic itself.\nFor instance, in regards to Shade’s fascination magic. Since it was magic that manipulated the mind, the danger scale was on A-class. However, there were also researches conducted on how to go against it.\nIn contrast, Lily had abilities which surpassed the Association’s assumptions. That is, her existence that exceeded common sense,『reaching a point beyond what can be done with magic』.\nA rare exception. It wasn’t an exaggeration even if I were to say that her very existence merits an S-class on the danger scale.\nIn fact, while the students were talking about Lily’s magical ability, the underclassmen had the tendency to mock it. As for the upperclassmen, they might have, at any rate, reached an understanding on what this meant – that is, about her dangerousness.\nIn addition to this, I’m worried about how she’d take to these students’ reactions. If they jeered at her, would she think them haughty? If she thought worse of it, I wonder whether she’d even hurt someone?\nTo tell you the truth, I have no idea what goes on inside her head.\nIn the game, 『Lily』 was a young girl that concealed her magical talents since magic was unthinkable for her origins as a commoner.\nIn the magical school, where the members had not changed since entering the school at age twelve, the girl, who was incorporated midway as a special case, caused great ripples to this school’s fixed routine.\nAlthough she had a strong personality given among other things, her origin and her ability score,『Lily』was the player’s own creation. I don’t know what words she’ll utter.\nHer personality, which can be glimpsed from among the choices, ends up greatly fluctuating when selecting any of those choices. ‘Which one is her true nature?’ or ‘Are any of these even her true nature?’.\nI started to think of wanting to know her – about the Lilium Valley who came to this school.\nLong after dinner, I continued thinking about this matter.\nI was in the dorm’s library, spending my free time alone.\nThis place was a relatively good spot that not a lot of people knew of. Students generally head to the library if they needed to find a book. Since the library furnished in the female dormitory had a limited collection of books, it was fair to say that almost no one comes to use it.\nIf they’d wanted to make this place just a little bit livelier for instance, they could have been partial to books for entertainment. Sadly, these books were just the ones that only adults would want students to read, they weren’t books that students would want to proactively read. Revised editions of books on history and literature comprised the majority of it. Since books related to magic were tightly regulated, there weren’t any here.\nThe room was the type that if you walked ten steps more, you’d have circled around it. Given that there were only two chairs set aside, it wasn’t even suited for friends to clamour into. Since it is a place for a forever alone book lover to rest her mind, I come here often.\nThere have been times when other students would occasionally visit, but, for some unknown reason, everyone who did, left in a panic. Not only that, they’d apologize to me saying they were『sorry for being a disturbance』. Even though I, the person who remained in the room and the one they said this to, didn’t tell them anything of that sort, could they not act so frightened?\nSince it was sad to think that the dormitory head was occupying this room, I guess they’ve held back from coming to this place.\nAnd so, as I heaved out a sigh, my ears caught the reverberating sound of a knock. Had they already known someone was using it since the lights were turned on?\n「Yes, come in」\nI remained inside, even though I was thinking that they might run away once they realized it was me, I urged them to come in. Somehow, it was Lily who came inside.\nAlthough I was extremely surprised, I realized that I was alone with her in this place. Right now, the female dormitory was brimming with rumours about her, and I fear that this could lead to special attacks in her room by groups stirred up by curiosity.\nThis might not be the time for me to be carefree in this sort of place. I’ve got to have a counter-plan as the dorm head.\n「... I’ll be leaving soon, so please feel free to use this place. If you’d like to borrow a book, then you’ll need to fill out necessary information at the bottom of the note–」\n「No, uhm」\nShe said, interrupting my words.\n「I... I was looking for you, Lycoris-sempai. There’s something I wanted to talk to you about」\nWhat... did she say...\nShe knew I was here and wasn’t running away, better yet, she came all the way over here to look for me...?\n「Is now a good time?」\n「...yes. So long as it’s before I retire to bed」\nOnce I said it, she went closer to my side, smiling happily.\nEven though I once again thought of it, she really was a cute girl. Although her features were also adorable, the carefree feeling truly left a good impression. This feeling seems loved particularly by the older ones.\nOffering her the chair, she merely said 「thank you very much」 unabashedly and immediately sat right next to me.\n「What I wanted to talk to you about is regarding what happened during our etiquette lessons, uhm, you did me a favor by helping me then, honestly, thank you very much!」\nShe swiftly and vigorously bowed her head down.\n「No, it’s no big deal」\n「But, I don’t have even the slightest idea about etiquette, I’m a total weirdo. And yet, Senpai, you still cheerfully agreed to be my mentor」(1)\nWell, I did get very upset about doing that though.\nLeaving that aside, her words made me slightly uneasy.\n「Do you really think yourself a total weirdo? Or perhaps, did someone say this to you?」\nReally,『Weirdo』 was a considerably nasty word.\nSeeing Lily sink into silence, could it perhaps be the latter? Inside the game, Lily had a considerably hard time getting used to the new school. This was natural. After all, she was abruptly thrown into a society whose living standards were different from hers.\n「I’ll be honored to give you guidance on etiquette, but I hope you won’t forget the most valuable thing」\n「The most valuable thing?」\n「You’ve also heard it from the teacher, right? The most important thing is the thought put into the action. For instance, you came today to especially express your gratitude to me. What you did was most important, it had sincerity, so don’t shrink too much, it’s alright to be confident」\nAlthough this were words spoken by the teacher, it seemed she was honestly affected by it. Even with the countless ‘thank you very much’, I was told the words repeatedly enough to be flustered.\nThen, when I was about to leave, she said this.\n「Uhm, is it alright to come here again?」\n「Eh? Yes. As long as it’s a dormitory student, anyone can come here...」\n「That’s not it. What I mean is, if I come here, can I talk to you again?」\nI ended up nodding my head too many times with excitement.\nWithout doubting my suspicious behaviour, she smiled happily and left the room.\nT-this...!!\nDid we... end up becoming friends!?\n(Is this alright!? Is it really alright that we promised to meet again so easily!? Is it okay to take her words to mean that she wants to talk to me!? Am I right in thinking that she likes me!? As expected of the heroine! What a nice, friendly girl! I think if we talk more, we might become even closer! W-we might even become best friends or something!)\nMy heart gushed with joy.\nI can’t stop myself from looking forward to the next time we’ll meet again.\nSomehow, it’s as if I was the one captured by Lily.\nJust kidding.\n(1) She says ‘sempai’ instead of ‘you’.",

      "content": "School Arc – Chapter 7\nSince that day, I went back and forth to the library. It’s fine to think me a forever alone with a lot of free time on her hands. It’s a sacrifice I have to make.\nThe best news was that Lily came to the library the next day and the day after that for me, and we talked about a lot of things there.\nAt the beginning, it was mainly about campus life and lessons.\nIt seemed that Lily really did have a considerably tough time, she said she couldn’t keep up with the subject matter in class in particular.\nThat’s natural. On top of not having any foundation before now, since she was made to skip over four years, making her try to understand the lessons of a fifth year student was a mistake.\n「Since the teachers have come to think that there is no way I can follow what they’re talking about, they don’t even call my name or ask me questions during class」\nLily said this with mixed feelings.\nIt’d also be troubling if she were given advanced questions, but to be completely neglected was probably not fun. She’s pretty strong-willed despite how she looks.\n「That... makes you want to change their opinions of you, huh?」\n「Yes」\nThat’s a good answer. Although I also personally like students who have the will, even as the dorm head, the other party should be worthy of help.\n「For history, if it’s alright with you, I can teach it to you. If you grasp the huge course of events until you reach the current lessons, it should be fine even if we set aside the memorization of the trivial details. For language class, I think there’s no other way but to earnestly read books, though... ah, no, first, we need to make the choices, right? Since it’s difficult to hasten all the courses in parallel, we should focus on the subjects you’re interested in...」\nWhile talking, I considered the things I ought to do myself after this.\nFirst, was a means that could be used more effectively during a subject’s class period. Things like only listening during a perplexing class would be a waste of time, and it could even chip off her will to learn. Since I can’t do anything about this on my own, I guess I have no other choice but to discuss it with the teachers.\nAt any rate, not being able to spare time during the day for Lily’s sake was tantalizing.\nSo that she doesn’t make the same mistake I did, I mustn’t make it known to others that I’m too concerned about it, otherwise, she’ll be kept at a distance from friends.\nFor that reason, we can’t make the bold move of visiting each other’s rooms in the dorm (it’d be impossible to do this without the other students seeing).\nStill, sneakily having clandestine meetings was fun in its own way.\nIt was fun to map out various learning programmes too.\nEven the idle chats we had together in our spare time was fun.\nThough I said idle chats, since I didn’t know what kind of topic would catch her interest, for the time being, I tried talking about Wolf or Shade – her 『capturable targets』 . Since they had caught her interest based on her reaction during the game, and because those two come up often in topics even in the female dormitory, I thought it was an easy starting point.\nBut, even though she seemed to be enjoying herself listening to what I said, she didn’t show any particular interest in them. I don’t know whether to be relieved or disappointed.\nThe most impressive thing, from what Lily told me, was what she said about her dreams.\nWanting to ensure that children won’t have their freedom unjustly restricted even if the child endowed with magical powers comes from the masses like her, seems to be her dream. For that reason, she wanted to enter the association.\nIt was a fine dream and, if such children who were currently suffering damage because of that existed, it was a problem that could not be ignored.\nEven though I left that aside, I had a devil of a time thinking about the question this subject raised.\nOne of which was about her past. When she said『have their freedom unjustly restricted』, I thought, ‘could she be talking about her own personal experience?’. In fact, when talking about her past, she doesn’t talk much about her family in particular.\nThere was no mother at home. She doesn’t like her father too much. That... was everything she said about her family.\nWhen I asked whether I could call her Lily, she said this while slightly at a loss for words.\n「Thank you very much... in my introduction at class, I did say 『my nickname is Lily』. But, honestly, no one calls me by that name anymore. In the past, Mother used to call me this, though」\nAs she said it, she gripped the pendant on her breast. Perhaps for her, it was a memento of her mother.\nPlease don’t show me such a tearful-looking face. Otherwise, I’ll tear up as well.\nBy the way, after this, I cheekily got her to call me 『Lycoris』, with a promise to do so when nobody was around.\nRegarding the things I was made to consider from Lily’s conversation, there was another one, this was about my own future.\nWas... there likely a time that I seriously thought about my future? Although I ought to be embarrassed as someone who was at her final year in school, I dare say, there wasn’t.\nVaguely, there were times that I thought, ‘Surely, it’ll likely turn out like this’ or something. However, from there, I didn’t have a dream or anything I’ve made my mind to do.\nBefore arriving in this school, the future was a matter of when I’d enter the school.\nBefore Lily arrived, the future was a matter of when the timeframe of the game would start.\nAfter that? What I wanted to do? What kind of life I wanted to live? I should think about them.\nAnother day, and again there was a terribly thrilling event.\nA little bird, who had a nest in a forest at the outskirts of the school, paid Lily a visit. At that moment, the words that filled my head were like this.\nW-what is this, it’s so heroine-like!!\n「Oh. For you to come as far as this place to find me, you sure are tenacious. Lycoris, I’ll introduce you. This little one is a child that accompanies me during lunch」\nSaying that, Lily opened the library’s window, a single lapis lazuli-colored little bird flew in. After the little bird circled the room, it settled on Lily’s shoulders.\n「This little one seems terribly accustomed to people. If you give him breadcrumbs just once, henceforth, he’d continuously come back with demands at lunch time」\nIt seems she’s been eating a sandwich or whatever else for lunch outside. I suppose it was a given that I didn’t see her in the cafeteria at lunch time. I eat lunch inside the school building, and was also generally together with Wolf or Shade.\nHowever.\nA golden-haired young girl in a blue dress eating lunch under the bright rays of sunshine. A lapis lazuli-colored little bird swooping down on her shoulder with a flutter and flapping of wings.\nI-it’s so heroine-like.\nAlthough she feels more like a heroine from the World Masterpiece Theatre rather than a heroine from an otome game, at any rate, it is a scene that ranks high in my internal『Heroine behavior ranking』.(1)\nWith great excitement, I looked at the little bird, but, it ended up flying away to avoid me. That was just typical. Sorry for getting carried away.\nJust like that, time passed by in a blink of an eye.\nEvery single day was enjoyable for me, I felt fulfilled.\nOn such a day, I had a realization as I was having a discussion in preparation of the dance lessons, which was on the day after tomorrow, with Lily. It was the first after the school term started, in other words, it was the first joint gender dance class for her. Lily was fretting over whether she might end up making a mistake in that place.\nHuh? And so, I felt a deja vu of some kind.\nDon’t tell me, could this be... Wolf and Lily’s encounter event?\n(1) It’s an anime , though I was seriously tempted to put it as Disney Princess to make it understandable for those who don’t know this anime.",

      "content": "School Arc – Chapter 8\nThe fifth and sixth year joint dance lesson, even while designated as a『lesson』, was actually closer to an event.\nA written invitation is delivered in the name of the school head prior to opening the exhibition, and even on the day when the exhibition opens, we’d have free time after dinner.\nThe location was a small hall at the 『guest house』.\nThe『guest house』was the name used among the student population, this building’s official name was the Culture and Arts Building of the Royal Magical Academy. Why the students used a name that wasn’t even remotely close to the original name, was because its image of a lodging facility for outside guests was strong.\nIn fact, the facilities that were contained in this building were an archive that collected rare books related to magic, a large hall for theatrical companies from the royal capital who were invited to do public performances twice a year, a small hall used for dance lessons and such, guest rooms for visitors’ use, and so on.\nBy the way, inside the school, this building is a very popular test of courage spot, especially for male students .\nIf spoken well of, it gives off a feeling that there’s a history behind it. If spoken ill of, that ancient building tickled students’ hearts.\nAnd, above all, 『an archive that collects rare books related to magic』. This was it.\nNot only was it terribly suspicious, it was a room that aroused all sorts of imagination. All the more, since students fundamentally do not enter the rooms.\nFor that reason, rumours that stimulate students’ curiosity and fear regarding this building do not die out.\nThey say several students that have done the test of courage in the past have gone missing.\nIt looks like the howlings of a terrifying monster have been heard inside the building\n– no, wrong, the thing they heard was the sobbing voice of a child.\nIt seems like there’s a mummy in the guest hall’s archive.\nWhat are you saying, the mummy is in the innermost room of the basement.\nI hear the mummy is the mummy of a demon king!\nAs might be expected of a magical school, even the seven wonders (to be precise, there wasn’t seven though) was abundantly preposterous in variety. What’s that about a ‘mummy of a demon king’? That idea of a demon king turned mummy was fantastic.\nBy the way, in the surrounding countries’, much less our own country’s history, the times a 『demon king』or the like having made an appearance in the past was — zero. Its existence appeared only in stories.\nMoreover, the mummy in the archive they’re talking about is probably the misunderstanding they made of the man that had been employed for over sixty years, Mr. Hemlock the librarian, who’d turned eighty last year.\nThe misunderstanding was about his appearance. When talking about an eighty-year-old grandfather, anyone would end up thinking of a wrinkled old man, but in reality, they’d only see him as a forty- or fifty-year-old man in the prime of his life, at most. There were these occasionally exceptionally strong people with magic, the type of people who looked considerably younger than their real age. Even his mind was young. If I were to say how young his mind was, it was young enough that he’d woo me, a person who visited the library for the teachers’ errands. Well, even though I say ‘woo’, he’d only invite me to tea in a gentlemanly fashion. There, the lip service was probably a mere association of it, though.\nI strayed off-topic.\nWhat was important was the joint dance lesson.\nConsequently, it was about the love events together with the capturable characters that was to happen with the game heroine, Lily.\nThat afternoon, when I tried asking Lily in detail, I came to know how low Lily’s encounter event consumption rate was.\nAt the moment, it looked to me that as far as Lily was concerned, the first person she would have a lot of contact with was Shade. While this was my own brother, it was expected.\nSince they also take a lot of the same lessons in the same school year, I learned they’d quickly come to be in greeting terms with each other.\nSince even the game’s encounter event for『Shade 』and 『Lily』 was an event where, having an interest in Lily, Shade had come talk to talk to her, it’s probably fair to say this was cleared.\nBut, when I tried asking her if they get along well, Lily’s answer was:\n『No. Not particularly』\nShe returned this with a blank look on her face. He talks with the other female students in the same way, nothing more to it, was the explanation.\nNext, also of the same year as her, was Ru Xiang. In regards to him:\n『 Every time I see him during lessons, I think, ‘what a beautiful person’』\nTo start with, from what she tells me, she has never personally talked to him. This had a slightly inevitable reason, Ru Xiang basically never moves alone.\nThe young boy called Oria, gangly and too insipid for some kind of 『guard』, follows him around often.\nThis young boy called Oria, was a point that I had on my mind. Actually, this young boy was nowhere to be seen in the game. For instance, even though the names for Art’s male cousin, along with the boy’s entourage and the like were never disclosed, they still made an appearance inside the game. And yet, the existence of the young boy, the only one acting as Ru Xiang’s guard, that was not in the game, was in here. I believe this was a slightly strange topic, though...\nWell, my memories related to the game were also sketchy, and I couldn’t remember well without a trigger, but, to begin with, the time in the game and the current one differed in many ways.\nAt any rate, the times where Ru Xiang is all on his own were limited to things like when he was in class or doing the tasks of a dormitory prefect. This meant the 『good old shoujo-manga-esque bump in the corridor』 encounter event for 『Ru Xiang』 and 『Lily』 was unlikely to happen.\nAfter that was the lower year, Art. In regards to him:\n『I’m not familiar with the person』\nI-is that so?\nOf course, she knows his name from conversing with me, though. And so, somehow, I ended up fussing over Lily.\nBut, well, isn’t it fine that she doesn’t particularly get to meet Art? After all, speaking of the encounter event for 『Art』 and 『Lily』, the dreadful impression was bad. I’m not sure whether『Art』, who took along his entourage as always, was poking his nose into『Lily』 who had an unusual history, or came to challenge her. Caused by a lacking imagination, it was an event where he decided ‘common people = poor’ and hooted at her.\nThese days, even elementary students wouldn’t take such a lousy approach.\nWell then, if that’s the case, this means that Lily’s favored choice will inevitably end up becoming Wolf.\nWell, to begin with, it didn’t mean there was a firm promise that Lily had to choose from among those four people, though. No, but, I hated the thought that Lily and Wolf might end up liking each other. Frankly, I wanted to give a warning to the two as soon as possible. Since I am Wolf’s fiancee, wouldn’t I have that right to do so? But, while nothing has happened, just how hasty would placing constraints be? Or rather, isn’t this no longer at the level of being called jealous? But once something does happen, it would be too late...\n(But, the 『Wolf』 in the game and Wolf, my fiance, are not the same. Wolf is an earnest person, he wouldn’t abandon me, his fiancee, without warning)\nOnly when I thought of it that way did I somehow regain my calm, I’ll just end up feeling sad thinking of things like 『Wolf』 and 『Lily』’s love events in the game.\nThe 『Lycoris』 in the game was honestly a third-wheel. When I was also playing, I often thought “I really hate her”.\n(It’s kind of depressing...)\nAll of a sudden, I ended up in thought.\nI like Wolf. Although a word like 『love』is exaggerated a lot, at any rate, I thought, ‘isn’t it that I have fallen in love with Wolf?’. It’s difficult for me to lose him.\nEven if I was suddenly told to cancel the engagement, I wouldn’t consent to it. Giving my blessings to the pair’s happiness was something I simply couldn’t do.\nSince I was already heading towards the same madness as the game’s『Lycoris』, could this have been arranged as a step forward?\nDoes the fact that I fell in love with Wolf mean I was heading towards a path of destruction?\nThat supposition makes my heart contract.\nThe time of the dance lesson came.\nThe dresses, in hues of each individual’s own liking, drew a picture of the waltz.\nIn the commonly deserted hall of the guest house, at the moment, were riots of blooming flowers that were doing nothing but dancing and smiling.\nOf course, the male students were also present in shirts donned in unfamiliar ties, and wearing shoes unsullied by mud.\nSince the leisurely triple meter dance was basic, almost no one among the fifth and sixth years found it difficult. At any rate, those who were weak at picking up the rhythm, and even those who were weak at moving their bodies, became in some way or the other, unexpectedly good when they enthusiastically practiced just this much. Everyone’s faces were shining with festivity.\nLily, who was wearing a new dress of emerald green which matched the color of her eyes, took her partner’s hand with a slight nervousness on her face. It was the first time she’d gotten a written invitation, and having nothing but this humble dress, she had on a strained smile; however, not only was the color of the dress’s bright and gentle impression matched well enough to say it was meant for her, her footwork was pretty good too.\nHer dance partner was Wolf. Since his reflexes were quite used to it, under the teachers’ instructions, he often linked arms and practiced with girls in the lower year who were not very good at dancing. Dancing with men who were skilled at taking the lead was the best way for beginners that had no confidence in themselves to improve. It was something that I, who’d been dancing with Wolf since before coming to this school, knew very well.\nSpeaking of which, I was present in my ever unchanging evening wear rouge dress. When I had danced a series of dances with false cheer, I then quickly grew tired and exited from the dance floor. After speaking with the teacher for a while, I gazed at the dance floor. And so, right now, that meant I had been gazing absent-mindedly at Wolf and Lily’s dance.\n（A cute couple with a height difference...）\nEven though I thought ‘stop thinking about it, stop thinking about it’, I ended up thinking about self-torturing thoughts.\nOnce the song was over, everyone retired from the floor. After Wolf and Lily exchanged a few words, only Wolf walked in my direction.\nI waited for him to come closer while being somewhat nervous.\nThe very first thing that Wolf, who had a somewhat serious expression, said was this.\n「Lycoris, I have something I want to ask you about」\nWith a sombre expression, I lost my mental battle.\n‘What is he going to say?’, I wondered, my heart pounding.\n「 Today’s dance partner – that is – whatever made you pick one out?」\n「??」\nNot understanding what I was just asked about, I tilted my head.\nToday’s dance partner? Is he talking about Lily? Ah, no. Wolf was asking about me. My dance partner today? I wonder, who was it again?\n「Sorry, Wolf. At any rate, I guess I was in the mood that I wanted to move my body today... Was there someone I was dancing badly with? 」\n「Oh, I see, is that what it was?」\nSince Wolf smiled with a cute face that I couldn’t easily bear to look at, I, who was somehow worrying myself, felt like an idiot.\nAfter all, just now, Wolf got jealous at my dance partner. Usually, when I’m directed by the teacher, there wasn’t anyone else I danced with aside from Wolf and Shade.\n「Hey, Wolf. This is a serious question I’m about to ask, so I want you to also answer me seriously」\nWolf nodded with a serious face.\n「Wolf, do you believe in fate?」\nThis time, it was Wolf’s turn to have a question mark floating on his head.\n「Perhaps I should say fated partner – for instance, someone who, if you love, will make you happy, like it was decided from the start... no, I have to say it more simply, right? For instance, as a person fated for you, although that person is strong and positive, that person somehow has a fragile side... how should I put it, a person you feel that you can’t leave alone」\nAt that point, Wolf, who seemed to finally understand, nodded.\n「... that would be you, wouldn’t it?」",

      "content": "School Arc – Chapter 9 Shade POV\n「I really want to know who’s the person that made you make that kind of face」\nMy words made her gaze back with a startled look.\nPrior to this, she had glanced towards my elder sister and the person who I fear will be my future brother-in-law, flirting with each other. Placing the standard distance from there, were the onlookers, who were watching them, while blushing for some reason; but, I dare say, they were probably a Lycoris or a Wolf fan. Those two had whimsical devotees that thought things like『I want to watch over the pair’s romance』.\nI really want them to stop it. In various meanings of the word.\n「May I invite you for a dance?」\nEven though I invited her with my best smile, the girl– Lilium’s answer was blunt.\n「The purpose of your invitation isn’t for a dance. It’s to have a talk with me, isn’t it?」\nShe’s a smart girl.\n「Could the talk be about staying away from your elder sister」\n「No way. I don’t have the right to say such a thing」\n「But, the reason why she doesn’t have any special friends even though she’s been yearning for them for so long, is because you have been an obstruction, is it not?」\nShe’s not only smart, she seems to be fairly strong-willed too.\n「That’s a misunderstanding. Neither I nor Wolf had ever considered a thing like wanting to keep Lycoris a loner, you know?」\n「But, if she had your cooperation, she should’ve found it easy to cultivate an understanding with those around her」\n「Well, it’s... like, you know. It’s not as if I proactively made her a loner or anything, but still...」\nI dipped my voice a little lower.\n「If that person ends up spending all her time on other people, wouldn’t it be lonely?」\nIs she going to ridicule, or reprimand?\nBut, Lilium’s reaction was neither one of the two.\n「I can also understand that kind of sentiment」\n(Oh?)\nMaybe it was because I showed her my true intentions, Lilium’s expression became a little calmer. Even so, it was only to the extent that I turned from a 『threat』 to just another 『stranger』.\n「You can understand why we’re jealous. Then, what kind of sentiment would be difficult for\nyou\nto understand?」\n「............」\nI decided to try to get one step closer to her thoughts.\n「For instance, familial affection, perhaps, or maybe friendship?」\n「It seems you know a great deal about my past, don’t you?」\nWithout flying out into a rage, she showed a provocative smile. It was a smile I’m sure was an expression that was the opposite of an 『\nit was supposed to be impossible for you to find out\n』expression.\nThe knowledge I acquired about Lilium Valley’s childhood, was that since she possessed power 『inappropriate to her life』 , perhaps with that, her relationship with other people, which was supposed to be depicted as decently peaceful, collapsed.\nHer abilities came to light in the form of an accidental discharge of power. From what I learned about the state of affairs at that time, it seemed every one of them had said that it was something short of a miracle that no one turned up dead.\nAnd then, her mother, not able to bear the terror of her daughter’s power, left the house. Her relatives, terrified of being connected to her, cut off ties with her. Her friends, regardless of knowing her innermost thoughts, whether it was out of fear or jealousy, all distanced themselves from her.\nHer father, in particular, was the worst. That man took great pains to determine whether Lilium had any value. Without ever handing her over to the care of the association, it seemed he kept her confined for who knows how long while he went looking around for a person who would buy his own daughter for the highest sum.\n「If you know about my past, then I guess you’re uneasy having a person like me by her side, right?」\n「Well, to be honest, I am worried. That’s because I can’t read your intentions」\nShe was aiming to get into a career in the association right after graduation. Since her will and her intention, which was wanting to monitor strong magic holders at the association, were consistent, that was an almost decided fact.\nFor people entering into the association, I wonder if there was some significance in having the status of being a friend of Lycoris, the duke’s daughter. Of course, it wasn’t like being a friend of an influential person can be disadvantageous, though.\n「Though you say intentions, I never thought of such a grand thing ... certainly, it still hasn’t been long since she and I met. But, I’m completely fascinated by her. Even though it looks like she’s surrounded by a lot of people, she seems alone, one way or the other. Although those girls around her love to look at her from a small distance away, despite that, it looks as though Lycoris doesn’t realize this and it only makes her feel lonely」\n「Do you like lonely people?」\nWhen I asked this jokingly, she sent back an exceptionally serious look.\n「Yes, that’s right. If you were to ask me, flickering between things like kindness or affection is easy. I like people who take the trouble to seek me. I like people who yearn for something earnestly」\nI couldn’t laugh at her.\n「... but, she isn’t really alone in the truest meaning, right? After all, you’re here, and he’s around too 」\nLilium sent back another glance towards Lycoris and her companion, those fresh verdure eyes narrowed with what looked to be sadness.\n「If it’s a command, I’ll place some distance from her. But I don’t want to hurt her so I won’t ignore her, just enough so all of you won’t feel uneasy」\nStaring at me with eyes that radiated some kind of tragic determination, I felt kind of bad. Whether I say something or I don’t, I’ll feel troubled, so eventually, my mouth opened.\nI really am soft on women.\n「That person — Lycoris, is someone that makes you sort of believe in things like kindness or affection, you know?」\nLilium had on a face that could be described as having been caught off guard.\n「So, why don’t you try getting along with her as best you can?」\n「...Is it alright? That I... still continue to be at her side」\n「Like I’ve been saying so many times, the right to decide that isn’t with me, you know. To begin with, no matter what I say, that person would eventually do whatever she wants anyway」\n「Would her lord knight also allow me to stay by her side?」\n「To people who inflict harm to my older sister, it’s honestly– it’s honestly terrifying, and Wolf would have persistently pried up their past and continuously tormented them or something, but other than to those people, he’s pretty lenient」\n「... I’ll bear that in mind」\nThe moment Lilium left my side, she waved her hand at me, carrying the first cute smile befitting her age on her face.\nWhile waving back a hand in return, I thought. By all means, I want her to do her best.\nRather than seeing her flirting with a guy (Wolf) , isn’t it a given that seeing her get along with a girl (Lilium) is infinitely better for my mental health?",

      "content": "School Arc – Chapter 10\nA calm day followed.\nThat day — the day of the dance lesson, Wolf’s unpredictable words were effective into bring me back to my senses. For me, that one sentence had me trusting his sincerity.\nBut, it was really embarrassing. The moment my mind wrapped around what was said, my brain tissues seemed to have boiled away.\nAlthough it was nice that he subsequently invited me out to the dance floor for the last dance, with my head completely blanked out, my dancing must’ve been a completely terrible sight. I can only pray that I somehow went along with Wolf’s lead.\nIn any case, instead of things like the game developments which I’d played in my previous existence, I decided to believe in Wolf’s sincerity.\nAnd, generally speaking, even if it’s Lily, if she knew that I was holding a doubt like this in me, she’d surely be taken aback from my earlier impoliteness.\nThe me right now had the luxury to laugh at how upset I’d been a while ago.\nLily’s studies were also going as planned.\nOf course, we’re still not at the point where we’ve gained back four years’ worth of delay, though. Most of the teachers expressed their understanding for her to easily digest more rudimentary subjects during class. Among them, some were even more proactive than the rest, there were some who suggested topics suitable for Lily, and there were even some who prepared lower-level textbooks for her.\nAt the end of the day, teachers like hard-working students. That was something to be happy about.\nAs her lessons on magic advanced, Lily’s magical aptitude was made clear.\nIn other words, she showed strong aptitude in healing magic and had the potential to handle a considerably wide range of other magics. Quite OP, I know.\nWhen I say, 『had the potential』, it’s because, at present, Lily hasn’t used any magic except healing.\nIn fact, since she caused an accident in the past by means of a magical outburst, due to that trauma, she has a strong psychological aversion against using any magic aside from healing.\nI don’t know whether she’ll overcome that circumstance or not, but it may turn out to be the key to Lily’s magic mastery in the future.\nAnyhow, that circumstance was a problem that nothing could be done about even if we rush it.\nOn that day, from morning onwards, I waited for lunch to arrive, my heart pounding with excitement.\nMy enthusiasm to start today’s lunch surpassed the usual. If I were to be asked by how much, it was to the point where I attended the morning class lectures without eating breakfast.\nSince class lectures were relatively quiet, I realized once I came into the classroom that if my stomach grumbled loudly there, it would be bad. I attended the lessons while trembling with fear, but thankfully, I didn’t meet social death. Honestly, it’s a relief.\nIf I were to say the reason why I was looking forward to lunch, it was because for today’s lunch, our group of four, comprising of Lily, Wolf, Shade and I, had a prearranged plan to have lunch outdoors.\nAn inconspicuous yet comfortable-looking place was marked as our choice of venue. From an upper-classman serving the dorm-head to a lower-classman, it was a treasured spot that was passed down through word of mouth.\nI was in charge of deciding and& securing the spot, Wolf’s was cooking, Shade’s was transporting the baggage and Lily’s was being the guest. Those were the allotment of responsibilities.\nTo be honest, Wolf was an infinitely better cook than me. I wasn’t particularly bad at cooking, but when Wolf makes it, the skill and taste was, without exaggeration, a level on its own; in regards to this, I admit my defeat.\nAlthough at one period in the past, I was the one who taught him how to cook, I couldn’t have imagined that since then, Wolf would end up having an interest in cooking. Maybe it was due to Wolf’s earnest personality, he has the tendency to stick to things once he decides to do it. It seems he brought some fairly decent cooking equipment into his room at the dormitory. Of course, he didn’t do something like have a kitchen from his home installed into the dormitory room. But, having such an unrestrained side, Wolf was\nstill\na rich young master from a well-to-do family.\nWell, as a woman, I was the slightest bit torn by complicated thoughts with regards to the gap in cooking skill between us. But, when I considered the poisoning attempt that happened to him in the past, him simply agreeing to an invitation of a “let’s eat lunch outside” with a smile on his face should be enough to be delighted about.\nIncidentally, Shade was an eating expert. And, since it seems like Lily is willing to show her cooking abilities to me one of these days, I’m looking forward to it from now on.\nToday should have been a wonderful lunch, at any rate.\nRight as I was leaving the classroom to hurriedly head towards the specified location, it would’ve gone better if I hadn’t gotten involved with the blonde.\n「Huh? Boss! Boss! Lady boss!」\nDo you think I’d turn around just because you want me to? Ignoring him as I walked, Art, not giving up, ran up to me with a trot. Naturally, he took his entourage along behind him.\nAs expected, when you become plainly involved with a mass of swarming people to this extent, the only thing you can do is stop your feet.\n「... I’d already told you I wasn’t going to reply if you used that nickname, hadn’t I?」\n「Understood, Dorm Head Lycoris」\nSince it was rare that Art would obediently change his words, I went ‘oh?’ then thought.\nArt, who was smiling and appearing to be in good humour, narrowed his light-brown eyes which were the spitting image of his elder sister’s, with ample charm; only his outward appearance was undisputably like that of an angel.\n「You’re awfully obedient today, aren’t you?」\n「I’m always obediennttt. Let’s go to the cafeteria together!」\n「Sorry, but I have something else planned. Maybe next time」\n「When’s next time going to be?」\n「I’m okay with any time. So long as you just tell me beforehand」\n「But we met today, so now should be fine!」\nEven though it was troublesome, I was cornered.\n「Give up for today. This should be fine, right? Anyway, it’s not like you’re alone」\nI implicitly hinted at his entourage while I said it, but he objected right away.\n「I don’t wanna! Unless you go with me, I’ll die of loneliness!」\nIs he trying to act like a rabbit? This rascal.\nEven if he’s the cute type, nevertheless, is this behavior really acceptable for a man in his mid-teens? I wish he’d pay even a little attention to his honour as a man.\n「You won’t die.\nEnd\n.\nOf\n.\nDiscussion\n」\nWhen I said this, leaving no option to talk back, Art puffed out his cheeks.\nAhh, if only Wolf or Shade was here! They would’ve been able to pin Art down by force or something, but with me alone, that’s impossible.\nThe plan to head to the designated place individually in order for us not to stand out has backfired.\nOf course, in this situation, Art’s “look-only” watchdog was useless.\n「Please listen to reason, Art」\nWhen I tried asking him imploringly, Art’s expression changed slightly.\n「...h~~mm. You must be doing something important」\n「That’s right! Do you understand it now?」\n「Well... fine. As long as you go with me to the cafeteria next time」\n「I understand! See you, Art」\nI walked away in great spirits.\nOf course, I had wanted to run out, but I can’t recklessly run inside the school with the public’s eyes on me. But then again, it wouldn’t look well if the person responsible for securing the place came last.\nI guess Art has finally exuded the self-awareness to be an upper-classman, huh? What optimistic things I’ve started to think about.\nEventually, I was first to arrive at the specified spot.\nAfter a while, Lily showed up, and we both started setting up the things needed for lunch.\nWith the way we were, we never noticed the gaze of the light brown eye watching us intently.",

      "content": "School Arc – Chapter 11\nThe final lesson of that day finished up and we were dismissed inside the classroom. While slowly tidying up the used sewing tools, I breathed out a sigh. Rather than a sigh of sorrow, the sigh I made put across the meaning of ‘I wish I could get this over with’.\n（Today’s afternoon lesson has been... an ordeal）\nPacked full after filling my stomach from lunch, my body, following instincts, made it clear that it needed rest that afternoon.\nFrankly speaking, I was sleepy. I was dying to take an afternoon nap.\nNo one called me out on my behaviour of constantly nodding off, so being dismissed without incident was deeply moving for me.\nThis school carried out theoretical lessons entirely in the morning, but, I think the schedule is pretty reasonable.\nIf theoretical lessons had been conducted in the afternoon, I don’t think I could’ve avoided an afternoon nap, given the lullaby that was the teacher’s voice.\n（But strangely enough, now that the lessons are over, things like drowsiness are now somehow being blown off...）\n‘I guess whether it be this world or Japan, some things never change’, I mused, buried in my thoughts.\nIt was then that the clattering sounds of hurried footsteps, from the direction of the corridor, came in.\n「Lycoris-oneesama! It’s Arutad-kun!」\n「Where!?」\n「At the courtyard!」\nThis tacit understanding was, sad to say, due to the bygone days we were made to be accustomed to from the turmoils that Art had raised.\nThe girl, who’d been so bold as to run towards an upperclassmen classroom, was someone who got along well with one of Art’s followers in the same year as him, and one of the girls whom I instructed to inform me if anything happened.\nI listened to her account as we headed towards the courtyard.\nAccording to her, during this afternoon’s lessons, Art and several others in his entourage didn’t show up, making her suspicious. After that, just as lessons were over, since that one person in Art’s entourage had been acting sneakily, she shadowed that person, and from what she said, the follower attempted contact with Lily.\n「I didn’t quite manage to catch what they were talking about, but after that, the two of them headed towards the courtyard together. They met up with Arutad and his friends there, and since it felt somehow very ominous, I decided to notify you, Onee-sama...」\n「Thank you. That was very helpful」\nThough, I’d prefer the use of『Onee-sama』to stop during strained circumstances, on this occasion, I closed my eyes to it.\nWith the courtyard’s greenery coming to view, I gave a sigh of relief seeing Lily standing face-to-face with Art and his group. It looks like a fight hasn’t broken out yet.\nBut, once I came closer, I noticed that something was strange with Lily. She stood there stock still, both hands over her chest, staring at a particular spot.\nFollowed the destination of that gaze, I unconsciously stopped in my tracks, feeling a dizzying case of deja vu.\nThe destination of Lily’s gaze.\nOn top of the piled up soil, was a rod erected ostentatiously.\nWhile feeling the color drain from my face, I stared at the 『gravesite』.\n「... why... did you....」\nWhen Lily formed those words with such difficulty as to be strained, Art’s derisive laughter came around.\n「I thought I’d make you learn your place as a commoner. Of course, the reason the bird became a sacrifice was because you didn’t have any other friends. Funny, huh~」\nThough this line was horrible and also unpleasant, it was as it had been in the game. I feel like the animal killed in the game was definitely not a bird, but aside from that, the rest was all the same.\n（But, this event was supposed to take place much, much later...）\nI thought as if explaining it in my mind.\nInside the game, there was certainly a scene where Art killed an animal that Lily was affectionate with. At that time, this was also how it went, him thrusting a flashy-made grave before Lily.\nSomething like he couldn’t forgive Lily getting attached to someone else, was the sort of reason he gave.\nBut in this stage, where Art and Lily’s relationship wasn’t even close to acquaintances, such a cruel thing shouldn’t have happened. No, it didn’t happen in the game.\nBut in reality, before my eyes was a small grave. The tip of the shovel was left as it was, affixed horizontally on the soil. At the side, a hole that appeared to have been dug up just a moment ago was... mh?\nEven as I was stuck in thought, Lily, who finally remembered to move, staggered closer to the grave. The overlooking Art jeered as she softly reached out a hand to that lump of soil.\n「Don’t tell me, you’re trying to dig it up? You really want to be face-to-face with a messed up friend? Uwaa, what bad tas~te」\nLily drew back her hands with a frightened jolt. During that recoil, the accumulated tears at the edge of Lily’s bright green eyes trickled down.\nWith that, my last bit of patience ran out.\nI walked up to Art in long strides, having forgotten even my manners, and before a slightly flustered Art could say anything, I slapped him on the cheek with all my might.\nWith a loud slap, a nice, satisfying sound was made as my palms felt the throb of pain.\nI thought he’d hit me back in the heat of the moment, but Art simply stared at my face with his mouth open in dumbfoundment, ‘idiot’ written all over his face.\nIncluding the spectators, everyone here went dead silent.\nThat’s right, the courtyard, to an extent, was a place that can be conspicuous. Seeing that such a commotion happened at the courtyard, the fact that Art had picked Lily as a bullying target must have already circulated to the entire student population by now. It’s likely that this will induce others to bully her. And of course, he probably did it knowing that would happen. To my annoyance, Art was a boy that was capable of such calculation.\nI was in a rage, but my thoughts were composed. Virtually prepared to contend with Art, I looked for allies amongst the spectators.\nThe first to remember to move, was that one person in Art’s entourage. Really, what a completely useless watchdog he was.\n「Y-you’re mistaken, Lycoris-sama! We never caught the bird in the end, this grave – we only piled up soil to trick her!」\nIn the end, he gave an explanation to something that I’d rather be left unsaid.\nLily probably didn’t notice with all the commotion, but the fact that a hole was right there beside the grave was a little strange. Generally speaking, the normal sequence was to first dig a hole, put the corpse in, then cover it with soil from the top.\nNot only that, catching a wild bird, no matter how accustomed to Lily it was, was still a difficult task. Making a fake grave then using it to scare her seems more likely.\n「Lily, it’s just as you heard. That little bird is most likely fine」\nLily raised her face, taken aback.\n「Lycoris, I...」\n「Yes. Go and find the bird. I’ll manage this somehow」\nLily nodded at my words, then ran off towards the forest where the little lapis lazuli-colored bird was likely located.\n「S-since you made a mistake, apologize! Getting hit is really painful! 」\nWhen Art shouted at me from behind, I looked at him over my shoulder.\n「A mistake? You were planning to kill the bird, weren’t you?」\n「That’s right, but we told you we couldn’t do it in the end, didn’t we! That woman just got tricked because she was stupid enough not to find anything fishy about it」\n「I completely understand it now」\nThis time, I intended to hit Art’s cheek with clenched fists. Because I knew it was my own indulgence that I ended up unconsciously slapping him earlier.\nBut, sure enough, the second time, even Art didn’t resign to accept getting hit. Since Art seized my wrist, in close range, I simply glared at him.\n「I thought even you would mature a little bit if I persistently nagged at you, but my outlook was too naive. In these three years, you really didn’t grow up at all. Being in charge of educating you is really impossible for me」\nDeclaring it vehemently as I faced him, Art, as always, uttered the same thing he usually did.\n「...why?」\n「『Why』, you ask? Until you understand, don’t speak with her\nor\nme. I won’t forgive you. Especially if you give Lily an apology that doesn’t come from the heart」\nOnce I declared those words, a large shadow obstructed my field of vision. Since I quickly realized it was Wolf, I breathed out a sigh of relief.\nAfter Wolf twisted Art’s arm pretty violently for me, he held out a handkerchief for me.\nI thought it was because I looked like I was about to cry, but in reality, my eyes were already brimming with tears. It wasn’t something I’d brag about.\n「Wolf, could I leave Art to you? I’d like to find Lily」\n「No, let’s go together」\nSince Wolf insisted, we eventually left Art to the care of a teacher nearby and headed to the forest to follow Lily. However, even though our time difference wasn’t too big, Lily was nowhere to be found.\nAfterwards, we assembled a group of people to search for Lily, but it was only after even night had wore on that we found her.\nWith an exhausted face, she came back aimlessly to the dormitory and ended up sleeping, almost as if she’d blacked out.\nShe kept sleeping for nearly a whole day after that.",

      "content": "School Arc – Chapter 12\nThe cause of Lily’s coma was diagnosed as something like fatigue by means of magic depletion. Though the details were something that made everyone incline their heads in wonder, even Lily herself, who had woken up, seemed puzzled.\n『I didn’t use magic yesterday. We never used magic during class either...』\nThis was what Lily said, according to the woman assigned as the doctor for the female dormitory.\nShe clearly remembered being called out by Art, the trouble that followed, and even until she went looking for the bird in the forest. Yet, her memories after that was strangely unclear.\nLily found the bird, as it was, in its usual spot. However, the little bird didn’t come down to Lily like it always did.\nThinking that the little bird might have been injured, Lily chased after the young animal as it flew away.\nIn favour of looking up as she made chase, it seemed that when Lily, who wasn’t too familiar with the terrain, realized it, she was already in a place she didn’t know. From there, Lily’s memories became more and more unclear.\nI’m certain I encountered someone\n, was what Lily had seemingly said.\nBut, for some reason, I can’t recall a thing about the other person.\nI ended up having a considerably long discussion with that person. And when I realized it, it was already late, so I hurried back to the dormitory.\nIt was an entirely vague story.\nWith even the female doctor bewildered, this was what I, who stormed in, was told.\nFrom beginning till the end, Lily had been somewhat absent-minded, it was like she was trying hard to follow those string of memories. But, eventually, without recalling who that person she had been with was, she ended up going back to sleep again. This happened last night.\nTo be on the safe side, Lily was taking a break from class today.\n「Even if she’s dopey from her coma, whatever the circumstances may be, don’t you think her memories are way too ambiguous? 」\nSince Shade said this, expressing something rude in his words, I glared at my younger brother, putting various meanings into my gaze.\n「Don’t say something as impolite as『dopey』. Lily is the victim here, you know」\nSince Shade, at times, makes cynical remarks by habit, I know he doesn’t mean anything ill from it. But, I couldn’t bring myself to ignore it today. Just before what may have been an outbreak of a sibling quarrel, Wolf nobly intervened.\n「If her memories are unclear to that extent, there is a possibility that magic was involved」\n「Yeah. I think so too」\nI nodded with a “that’s exactly what I thought”, then flauntingly, I flattered him with an “as expected of Wolf”. Shade faced the other way, acting slightly pig-headed.\nToday, our group brought food into the small cafeteria for visitor use and had our lunch. Although the special rights, which were granted to the dormitory head and the prefects, wind up being called excessive, that was pretty much it. Since we didn’t break the tacit understanding of not littering and not causing too much uproar, getting permission to use this room with just a reason of『we have something we wanted to discuss a bit about』wasn’t difficult.\n「We’ve confirmed that this wasn’t the work of magic muddling her memories, at present. But, maybe that person who Lily was talking to, applied magic on himself making him difficult to remember. There has to be a method for how he did it」\n「If that’s the case, who was she talking with? Why would he go to the trouble of concealing himself? And, why did her magic dry up?」\nWolf’s words apparently piqued Shade’s interest, since the sulking Shade suddenly returned to the conversation.\n「But Miss Lilium’s power was strong enough to break the measuring instrument, wasn’t it? For it to have dried up, you’ve got to wonder what on earth that amount of magic was used for」\n「You do know Lily should only be able to use healing magic, right?」\n「That’s what makes it so mysterious, don’t you think? Do you think she resurrected the dead or something?」\n“That’s not the scope of healing magic-“, I stopped midway, having realized. Lily’s magic was non-standard.\n「...for what reason would a dead person be inside the school」\n「Maybe someone died from some sort of accident inside the school. Having been on-site, Miss Lilium performed resuscitation by magic. Then, someone used some sort of magic so she couldn’t remember」\nAlthough it was quite absurd, the chance of it wasn’t zero. As I was led astray, Wolf countered Shade’s theory.\n「Finding a corpse and resurrecting the dead are both fairly shocking events. Casting magic to conceal these so that nothing remains in the person’s memories is likely impossible」\n「Well then, there’s still the possibility that Miss Lilium was lying from the start, isn’t there?」\nWolf didn’t reply to counter this.\nIt was at that moment that I became painfully aware of the fact that these two didn’t entirely trust Lily’s words.\n「... there are still other possibilities. Maybe『whoever』 met up with Lily was after Lily’s magic. Since her magic abilities are strong, the person might have been scheming to use her magic」\n「Are you saying that someone can actually use other people’s powers?」\n「I’ve only heard it in stories, but, I’ve seen records of the country and the association performing experiments trying to do so」\n「And so? Did those experiments actually work?」\n「It did show some results, you know.\nBut the performance and success rate were very low considering a complicated, grand-scale magical equipment is needed」\n「So, are you saying that even if the person painstakingly takes Miss Lilium’s strong magic, he can’t really do anything with it? What’s more, you’re saying that a 『complicated grand-scale magical equipment』 is actually in this school?」\n「... This standpoint in which I have absolutely no evidence to support my opinion is exactly like your theory a while ago, don’t you think?」\n「Ah~ yes, yes. In other words, this is Elder Sister’s sophistry, isn’t it?」\nWhen I tried answering back, Shade cut me off, saying「let’s go back to discussing it seriously」in a low tone.\n「Elder sister, you’re way too decided that everything that’s happening to Miss Lilium lately is all because of outside factors, you know?」\n「 Well that’s because this is Art’s doing. Don’t you think it should be clear that Lily is the victim in all of this?」\n「Although there’s no doubt that she’s a victim in terms of what Art did, we still don’t know what happened after that. After Art’s fallout with you, he’s been under close watch together with his followers, so, shouldn’t we consider that『what happened after that』 was an entirely different incident? Although it’s natural to worry about a friend who’s been comatose for a whole day, please calm down a little」\nGetting told off by Shade while simultaneously getting patted by Wolf on the head with a “there, there”, I ended up scowling.\n「I intend to calm down, though」\nEven while I retorted back, Shade laughed contemptuously at me.\n「Only『intend to』, huh? Well, I won’t say that everything Miss Lilium said was a lie, but if her memory was really foggy, then her assertion that she didn’t use magic is strange. The discrepancy might be because the report came from someone else, but please be a little suspicious about it」\nAfter he said this, I was taken aback.\nHe’s certainly right when he puts it that way.\n「It looks like we may have to hear the full account directly from her for now, Lycoris. After that, I just hope you keep in mind...」\nSince that was a sign that even Wolf was going to give me a sermon, I shrank back a little. But, when he continued, Wolf’s voice was gentle.\n「Swallowing someone’s words isn’t proof of friendship and doubting someone’s words doesn’t necessarily mean you’re acting against that friendship either. At least, that’s what I think」\nI took in the words that Wolf said as he looked right at me with those blue-violet eyes.\nSwallowing Lily’s words wasn’t a proof of our friendship. Is it really okay even if I doubt her words?\n「What’s important is that you make an effort at that time to support your friend. That’s also why you need to determine the truth with your own eyes」\nThe words were ideological, but I got what he was trying to say. Wolf — and, unfortunately, even Shade, were, in a sense, my coaches in making friends.\n「... I understand. I’ll bear that in mind」\n「Please do. When I’m looking at you now, I feel a little uneasy. I know you’re happy to get a friend though」\nEven to an outsider, I’d probably looked pretty fired up when Lily became my friend. It’s a little embarrassing.\n「Saying something like this probably won’t make much of a difference, but... I’d rather you don’t get hurt」\nBut, I think it’s pretty embarrassing to say something like that with a deadly earnest expression, even for Wolf.\nWhile my face reddened, Shade’s face looked like he’d just eaten something sour.\nFollowing the pair’s advice, I planned to hear the full account from Lily. I did keep in mind that she might not tell me the truth.\nHowever, even after several days had passed, I didn’t get the chance to personally talk with her. She’d shown up to class after the three days worth of rest, but she never showed up at the dormitory library room.\nWhen I think of the frequency that Lily appeared in the library room until now, it should have been obvious that she was avoiding me.\nMustering up my courage on one occasion during the night, I tried to go to her room, but the room was quiet and had no lights on. When I considered that she was sleeping since she hasn’t fully recovered, I couldn’t bring myself to intrude on her.\nFurthermore, if Lily was getting better, it didn’t look like it from what I saw of her outside of school. Even at a distance, I could tell she was tired since the skin around her eyes had dark circles. I could tell it wasn’t merely a trivial matter.\nIf so, then I have to do a frontal attack — I had decided to hear from her by summoning her as the dormitory head.\nBut then, news arrived to me that Art had received serious injuries.\nAnd that... was just the start of the terrible chain of events to follow.",

      "content": "School Arc – Chapter 13\nArt’s injuries were a dislocated left arm and a bone fracture on his right leg. It seems he had fallen from the stairs.\nSince it happened at the dormitory’s stairs, there were many witnesses. From the moment when Art, who was walking alone, dazed and unusually without his entourage, fell down the stairs, up until the moment he seized the handrail with his left arm in panic, but unable to regain his balance and tumbled down – the students were all there to witness it.\nSince Art seemed to have been dishing out complaints that the painkillers weren’t working at all, by the time Wolf and Shade rushed in, I was at ease for the moment.\nNevertheless, it didn’t change the fact that he sustained serious injuries. It seems like his followers were all very distraught, and because the female students weren’t allowed inside the male dormitories, they were especially heartbroken.\nBut well... there are doctors who use healing magic in the school. Even if this was considered a big deal, Art should have come back to school healthy after 2-3 days at home.\nHowever, he didn’t come to school, disregarding what was widely expected of him.\nIf one were to ask why, it’s because Art was throwing a tantrum.\nThat boy, who was being an inconvenience to others, said this:\n『Until Lycoris comes to visit me, I won’t go back to school』\nThat... seemed to have been what he said.\nThe moment I heard this, I was annoyed.\n“Hah?”, like a yakuza, I made a sound that would even turn delinquents pale. In my head, that is.\nAfter all, the one who came to relay these words of Art was just someone amongst Art’s followers, a girl in the same year as Art. She meant no ill intention from it.\nAlthough in a fit of anger, I intentionally ignored the request, that actually ended up tying to another disturbance.\nWhen I heard that Lily was called out by Art’s follower in the pretense of 『wanting to apologize or something』, I hurriedly rushed out of my classroom. A feeling of deja vu, that something like this has just happened quite recently, cut in.\nActually, since I was also thinking of talking to Lily today even if I had to summon her out, this meant someone beat me to the punch.\nIn any case, I wasn’t deluded enough to think that his followers would call Lily out just to apologize.\nTheir thinking, sad to say, was something I quickly ended up guessing. In short, they speculated if things go well, they could use Lily in order to make me go visit Art.\nA scene where his followers put Lily on the spot by prostrating themselves before her came to mind.\nBut then, what I saw when I rushed in, was a much more terrifying sight.\nWith a crash, a loud destructive sound was made.\nAs it reflected in the sunlight, the torrent of glass rained down over Lily and the group.\nThough it was quite pathetic of me, I simply stared at the scene in shock.\nOnce I finally came to my senses, I saw, amidst the flying glass shards, Art’s followers suffering small cuts on the bare portions of their skin such as the face and hands.\nThere were probably some who got hit by the unfortunately large shards, besides the male students, who were dripping blood from their arms plain enough even for an onlooker to see, several remained where they were, unable to stand up, either due to fear or surprise.\nBig or small injuries aside, objects that could turn into lethal weapons were falling from above in large quantities. I wonder how terrifying it must be. At any rate, I, at least, had to calm down, I told myself.\nSince there was a boy who rushed over here after spotting me, I halted him by shouting「don’t run!」.\n「Move calmly and slowly so you don’t get injured by the glass. You musn’t scrape off the broken glass on your clothes with your hands」\nThe property which makes it difficult for things like a car’s window glass to hurt the human body is famous in modern day Japan, but the glass fragments here form rough sharp edges when they break, so it is dangerous indeed. When I glanced up, the large glass window on the second floor was completely void of glass, its frame the only thing intact.\nI observed the state of the male student’s injury, which looked to be a deep cut made in his haste, then pressed down on the blood vessel to stop the bleeding.\nEven though it was a little ironic that the teachers quickly rushed over all thanks to the loud noise, I was still thankful for it.\n「Lily! Are you hurt!?」\nI called out to Lily, who was all by herself, paralyzed on the spot a short distance away. Face dreadfully pale, she looked like she was about to collapse at any time.\n「Lycoris...」\nMuttering in a scarcely audible voice that was so unlike Lily, she cast her eyes down as if afraid of something.\nThere wasn’t any visible injury I could see on her, so for the time being, I was relieved.\n「Anyway, go to the medical office if you can walk」\nI pinched Lily’s dress and tried shaking off glass from it. But, not even one glittering shard fell from her dress.\nThen, for the first time, I started to realize that the glass fragments were not falling around Lily. It was completely clear of falling debris, almost as if the shards were avoiding her.\nLily, as if she was afraid of something, continued to look down.\nThese details... spread throughout the school in a flash.\nEven if we can’t conceal the amount of damage that came out, there was something I was dreading very much.\n（At that time...）\nWhen I heard the crash, a fragment of glass fell down. Logically speaking, when something collides with glass that’s attached to a window frame, broken shards will fall down. If the broken pieces fell outside, the possibility that it was smashed from inside the building was high.\nHowever, if it was just something that collided into the window, it was strange that not a single glass remained on the frame.\nA power that could single-handedly hit the entirety of the large window glass, in this school, it’s obvious to infer that 『it was magic』.\nIn short, the glass piece broke due to magic, then rained down on top of a mass of people. it only avoided one person.\nMy fear was soon becoming a reality.\nInside the school, one rumour had spread as if it was a fact.\nThat the incident which happened today was due to Lilium Valley’s magic. No... they’re saying that to begin with, Arutad Brugmansia’s injuries were done by Lilium as an act of revenge.",

      "content": "School Arc – Chapter 14\nThe recklessly-stated rumours were rapidly embellished through hearsay.\nEventually, the rumours that『Lilium Valley was involved in causing the injuries』 and the like, were told as if they was true.\nSome of the students ended up getting frightened by this rumour.\nThe new students, in particular, who still hadn’t gotten used to dormitory life, raised their unease, and some girls ended up crying, so for the prefects and I, it was chaotic.\nWhile trying to calm the girls down by soothing and humoring them, I was worried sick about Lily.\nIn the end, though it was inexcusable for me to do so, I snuck away, leaving the new students in the care of the prefects. When I headed towards Lily’s room in a quick pace, sure enough, I had a problem of my own.\n「If you’ve caused harm to people by using magic for your own self-interest, then you’re not fit to be a student of this school」\nThe voice that said this to Lily, and which resounded all the way outside the room, was a familiar one. A person in the same year as me, that is to say – a final year student by the name of Viola. In the previous year, she was also the person that served as a prefect together with me.\nEven though she’s a little quick at jumping to conclusions, she’s intense when she makes up her mind. When I said it that way, it would seem like she’s a person that wasn’t appropriate as a prefect, but, coincidentally, Viola was a woman that was both diligent and helpful. Since her grandfather was a multimillionaire, he was awarded the position of a baron, but it couldn’t be inherited – a life peer, as one would call it. The fact that she, who never had high standings if we’re talking about her social status alone, became a dormitory prefect, meant her appointment was largely due to her own wit and popularity.\nI drew in a slightly long breath to calm down. If my opponent is Viola, I had to get her to understand without agitating the situation.\nAlthough Lily’s room was blocked by the curious onlookers, I still managed to see the situation inside.\nThere were three people who were confronting the owner of the room, Viola and her two friends. From a step behind Viola, sending a relentless look to Lily, was a brown-haired female student. If memory serves me right, her little sister was part of Art’s entourage. Maybe she couldn’t sit still with her little sister injured, but coming to a lower-year student’s room as a trio to yell at Lily was cruel all the same.\n「...I... didn’t use magic at that time...」\nEven though it was in a soft voice, Viola’s friend had to raise her own voice in order to drown out Lily’s resolute reply.\n「As if I’d believe you! Don’t you know that everyone present there was injured? Everyone, that is, except you, Lilium Valley!」\nHer agitated voice was shrill, turning a deaf ear to Lily’s words. It seems this one is even harder to crack than Viola.\n「Excuse me. Would you kindly let me pass.」\nWhen I raised my voice, everyone stared in my direction. The curious onlookers all had on a look that said『oh, dear!』 and apologetically opened a path for me.\nWhen I stepped into the room and met their gazes, Lily cast her eyes down in a complicated look. I didn’t expect that reaction to sting, but at any rate, right now, I had to do something about this commotion.\n「First, I’d like someone to explain why, as final-year students, the three of you are causing a commotion at a place like this」\nI turned back from Lily, facing Viola and her group.\nTaking into account the trio’s personalities and power dynamics, I believe persuading Viola would be the best course of action.\nBut, I wonder if she’d decided to visit this place before taking a bath. Her golden hair was still in a flawlessly vertical roll that hasn’t changed at all since morning. I’ll be saying it once again,\nher golden hair was in a vertical roll\n. Maybe I’ll say it one more time:\nGOLDEN HAIR. VERTICAL ROLL.\nShe is the most dazzling beauty of the magical academy. Her golden lashes should’ve absolutely had a weak claim compared to black hair, but even at the best of times, her big violet eyes more than stood out for it. Since it looks like around five matchsticks can be put on it, I’ll certainly try testing it out someday. (1)\nWith an impressive pointed nose, she unyieldingly displayed a mix of confidence and cuteness. Her stature wasn’t tall, yet, due to her dignified behavior, she had presence.\n「As a final year student, Lilium just arrived at this school, so I merely thought to explain the significance of using magic to her」\n「Even if that’s the case, there’s no need to have three people, is there?」\nLooking as if I hit her where it hurt, Viola glanced behind her.\nAlthough she had a slight tendency to be reckless, she wasn’t someone who’d form a clique just to show someone contempt. She probably ended up driven to righteous indignation after seeing her friend in tears.\n「That’s... certainly as you say. Doing things in this way wasn’t right」\nIt seems Viola had quickly reflected on her actions.\nWhen I nodded and said “great, great”, pleased with myself, I was given a tense glare by Viola.\n「But having said that, did you clearly understand why we came here after circumventing you, the dormitory head?」\n「Eh?」\n「There’s a rumour within the dormitory」\n「If it’s the rumour about Lilium, then I know about it. It’s completely unfounded」\n「It isn’t just that. There’s also a rumour related to you. And if you ask me, that rumour may be even more serious」\nMy eyes widened in surprise and Viola nodded as if to say ‘it’s just as I thought’.\n「It seems you are not aware of it. The rumour goes like this:『Dorm head Lycoris is covering for Lilium Valley because she’s a very close friend. Since there is partiality, she probably won’t hand down fair judgment against Lilium 』」\nI listened to those words, feeling bitter.\nThe curious onlookers watched over, holding their breaths, wondering how I’d answer Viola’s words. When I observed that situation, I could tell that the rumour that Viola voiced out had circulated as common understanding among the girls.\nNaturally, there was an occasion that came to mind. During the incident when the glass fell today, I had called out to her with a『Lily』. Even if I hadn’t, it wouldn’t be strange for someone to notice, perchance, that Lily and I were meeting in the dormitory’s library.\nIt was sensible for the girls to call it 『favoritism』. And, since they decided I couldn’t be counted on, they probably got Viola to carry out the responsibility instead.\n「So, would you mind explaining?」\nAlthough I looked at Lily as Viola pressed me, she remained looking down with whatever thoughts she was tormenting herself with. For the time being, I conveyed what I must as the dormitory head.\n「...regardless of a friendship between Lilium and I, I would like to amend the 『guilty until proven innocent』attitude」\nAfter looking around, I glanced at the brown-haired student standing behind Viola.\n「Lilium’s magic aptitude specializes on healing. I doubt she’d be able to break the glass」\n「T-that’s because... Lilium’s power is... special...」\nAnd, as if to say that adequately explained everything, that was all she said. I understand she was worried about her little sister, but that doesn’t mean it’s okay to blame Lily.\n「If you’re saying we should press this crime on Lilium for that reason, then wouldn’t that way of thinking no doubt be『guilty until proven innocent』? This is precisely why we should consider the conduct fitting for magical academy students. Right now, we’re no different from those people in history who forced the cause of all disasters upon those who own magic」\nAlthough it was long before this country we have today, our ancient history had a past of persecuting those with magic. For those possessing magic, history was never told without it.\nEven the girls, who had been looking on curiously, collectively hanged their heads in shame upon my words. However, Viola alone, was different.\n「I understand what you said. Even I believe that storming into an underclassman’s room is imprudent. But, I hadn’t heard a single answer. In the end, is there a friendship between Miss Lycoris and Lilium Valley? Was it not because you kept it poorly hidden, that a rumour like this emerged?」\n（Uu....）\nI was taken by surprise when she hit me where it hurt. Certainly, having come this far, it would look more suspicious to hide it.\n「Without a doubt, Lilium– Lily is my friend」\nUpon my words, the students buzzed with chatter.\n...well, I don’t think it was that surprising. Maybe they found it strange that someone actually became friends with me.\n「She’s an important friend, that’s why I believe her. But, I won’t force any of you to think the same. I only want you to calm down」\nAfter saying that, I snuck a glimpse at Lily, curious about her response. If she’s angry, I’d been thinking of whole-heartedly apologizing, but she fixed her wide-open, fresh verdure eyes in my direction. I couldn’t perceive her gaze as angry. Bewilderment, and if that wasn’t just my conceit, joy, colored her face.\nIt’s honestly been a very long time since I properly met her eyes.\nAlthough there was a troubling turmoil going on, since it felt like I got through to her after so long, I felt glad.\nI relaxed, letting my guard down, but, as if pouring cold water over my heart...\nA change happened.\nSuddenly, without any prior notice, the color in Lily’s eyes changed.\nThat wasn’t a metaphor.\nFrom the bright fresh verdure, the color seemed to congeal to a dark green.\nStartled as I was, in front of me, Lily cowered, trying to press down her own eyes with both hands.\n「...Stop! Don’t come! N-NOOOO!!」\nIn a tone different from usual, Lily shouted. Startled, the curious onlookers, including even Viola, watched Lily closely.\n「Run away! Lycoris!」\nEven if Lily pleaded frantically for me to do so, under these circumstances, there’s no way I can just leave her behind and run away.\nWhile I don’t really understand what’s going on, I instructed the students to leave the room.\n「Viola, could you go call a teacher?」\n「Y-yes. I understand」\nI waited until she ran out of the room, then, just as I approached Lily’s side, with a crash, the glass windows in Lily’s room shattered. Although I stood prepared, recalling the incident that happened during the day, the glass piece did not rain on me.\nInstead, as if it didn’t care at all about the turmoil that happened, a small lapis lazuli shadow elegantly came diving into the room. Appearing from outside which was already shrouded in darkness, was, what shouldn’t have been in the dark – a small bird.\nIn front of my wary eyes, it abruptly changed appearance.\nIn the next flicker of a moment, standing there was a deep blue-haired figure possessing beauty that wasn’t human. Its eye color was a dark green, closer in color to black. Earlier, when Lily’s eyes changed, the color was just like this. The clothes wrapped around its body was somewhat anachronistic, it looked to me like that profile was artificially molded and the colors that joined together were sculpted.\nBut, what was most alien to me was that the scenery opposite him could be seen through. He was semi-transparent. He wasn’t a spectre though. I knew this man’s natural shape.\nWith a chill running down my spine, in my mind, I shouted.\n（S-secret chara–!!）",

      "content": "The secret chara’s name was Gift. His image color was blue.\nI wouldn’t have thought it was possible for a character’s past and personality to be so ill-matched to such a lovely name.\nGift was, in outline, human in species. However, his age easily crossed to a little over a hundred.\nWe learned about him at school... as the worst possible case of magical rampage.\nIn the past, his birthplace, a village among the mountains, had simply disappeared because of Gift’s rampage. The king in those days, unable to grasp what exactly happened, sent an army to that territory. And so, the army, who was responsible for protecting a child, the sole survivor of the village, was, on that same night, wiped out by that child — by Gift.\nEven though the information after this came not from the lessons on history, but from my knowledge of the game, what he had to say went something like this.\n『It’s scary not knowing what living humans would do to me. That’s why I killed them』\nAfterwards, Gift was captured at the price of countless sacrifices, but he was ultimately never killed. Demonstrating a talent of a kind never to be seen again in not only attack magic, but also healing magic, it was said that there had been no way to kill him; but, I don’t doubt there were researchers in the association who’d regret losing that talent of his too.\nAnd so, Gift was imprisoned in a form close to death. It would also be fine to describe it as “sealed”. Due to a large-scale magical device, he was at a state where his magic was always drying up, so it been arranged for him to sleep deep underground. Sometimes, the researchers would visit Gift’s location and conduct experiments on him over and over again.\nThat place was none other than the『guest house』.\nIn other words, the rumoured existence of a 『mummy of the demon lord』, was actually him. And old Mr. Hemlock, the librarian, was, in reality, the guard protecting the seal over Gift.\nI want to say ‘don’t bury that sort of landmine under the school building where people responsible for the country’s future assemble’. I want to say it from the bottom of my heart.\nFor the sake of never taking out the treasured grimoire out of the guest house, the strongest and most complex barrier was here. “That’s why, this place was concluded to be more secure than the other locations,” was what Mr. Hemlock explained in the game; but now that I’ve seen the situation turn out like this, I am, of course, not entirely convinced.\nIn other words, the country’s greatest leaders were lacking in imagination. In this school, the ability to have a yandere fall for you was top-notch. When the heroine, Lily, entered the school, they never even considered the possibility that Gift would start taking action in secret. Think about it, would you!\nIf Lily was just some powerless girl that a yandere fell for, then it might have turned out alright. However, Lily had exceptional healing magic. She had enough power to, say, revive the mummified Gift.\nThe rarity that was the pair’s love, wherein they shared the loneliness caused by their exceptional magic, was the number one route that I regretted the most playing, even with the『actual game』. The route was called, the academy’s destruction route.\nTo say the least, Gift, who feared humans to the extreme, was a character with destructive thoughts. The sole exception to these thoughts was Lily alone.\n『When the world becomes completely leveled with only you and me there, I’m sure it would be the first time that I’ll be able to feel relieved from the bottom of my heart』, were his lines in the story.\nAnd, under normal circumstances, there would have been nothing I could do before such a terrifying landmine. But, thankfully, I had the『knowledge』 of the current situation. It was the knowledge of the game with regards to my past life, as well as the knowledge related to the magical device that was binding this 『demon king』.\nWhile focusing on the translucent demon king, I called out to Lily.\n「Lily, be strong. It’s not as if he’s been freed from the magical equipment. It doesn’t mean his powerful magical abilities have returned to him. He shouldn’t be able to wield power as he pleases」\nThe semi-transparent body was proof of that. His actual body was still in the basement of the guest house.\nAlthough it would be too late to stop Gift after he gets Lily’s all-out cooperation to fully revive him, it’s not at that stage yet.\nEven while thinking of that in my head, my voice quivered. His existence in front of my eyes was exceedingly fleeting, and yet, maybe it was because of how terrifying the talent hidden in that body was. Even with his magic almost gone, I understood, though vaguely, just how large that hole was. An endless abyss. Such words floated in my mind. My instincts felt fear with the emptiness he carried.\nLily had been even more resolute than I. When she nodded, gaining strength with my words, she stepped forward in order to protect me.\nThose small shoulders were trembling. As if they were unable to bear the weight of something.\n「...Lily. Do you... like him?」\nI later thought that this question was out-of-place, but at the moment, it wasn’t meant just to stall time, I felt I had to ask Lily this.\nLily’s gaze remained on Gift as she answered.\n「...I had been fiercely captivated. I knew he was hopelessly lonely. So every night, I snuck out of my room and met with him. We talked about a lot of things and sympathized with each other. Our time together, was really fun. To think, there had been someone who needed only me. But...」\nI was able to understand the part that Lily couldn’t say out loud. Falling in love with Gift was like falling together into the abyss. But, I dare say, the edge of that abyss probably wasn’t what deterred Lily.\nWhat entered my mind was the enjoyable lunch we had as a group with Wolf and Shade. At that time, I heard her laugh aloud. Without a doubt, she was truly happy then.\n「Gift, I won’t allow you to hurt anyone else any further」\n『It’s not “anyone else”. But, “that woman”, no?』\nGift said with a growl in his voice.\nAnd then, his eyes, which had not even for a moment projected anyone else but Lily since the moment he appeared at this place, went past Lily and moved to me.\nThe look in those eyes, I wonder what was the best way to describe it?\nFrom those deep green eyes, it was as if jealousy was dripping out.\n『Woman, you said there was no power in me. It’s just as you said. I don’t have any significant amount of magical power. But even then, I can still kill you』\n「If you hurt Lycoris, I won’t forgive you」\nI could only hear Lily’s voice somewhere in the distance. At that time, I was trapped in those green, almost black, eyes. My whole body stiffened with terror. I was groping for a spell to protect my body, but doing so simply spurred on the chaos.\nIn that moment, as if clearing the frigid atmosphere, footsteps resounded from the corridor .\n「Lycoris!」\nHearing that reliable voice call out my name, I breathed out a sigh of relief. Actually appearing when I wanted him to was an amazing characteristic of Wolf’s.\nAfter that, in a blink of an eye, was an incident.\nAt the same time as when Wolf stepped into the room, something similar to a black fog gushed out from Gift’s hands and attacked me. And then, with nimble movements, Wolf protected me in his arms.\n『I curse you』\nI heard Gift say in a murmur.\nThen, he turned to Lily and, as if whispering intimacies, said sweetly to her:\n『When the people you love, are completely seized by the darkness building in them. That’s when I’ll come for you again』\nAfter leaving behind such words, he disappeared from this place like a puff of smoke.\nThen, dispersing as if blending into the air, the black fog — disappeared as well.",

      "content": "School Arc – Chapter 16\nThat night, I saw a dream.\nWith Gift’s words — the words,『I curse you』, lingering in my ears, there’s no way I’d see something like a pleasant feel-good dream. What I saw was a bad dream.\nIn that dream, 『Lycoris Radiata』 was a repulsive woman who had gone mad with jealousy.\nEven though Wolf had repeated the words ‘I want you to trust me’.\nEven though Lily shed tears and said ‘I would never betray you’.\nEven when those earnest words were enough to make my chest hurt as I observed the scene, 『Lycoris』did not give them her trust.\n『Cruel! Even though I loved you! Even though I trusted you!』\nWith such words filled with betrayal, she did nothing but blame the pair.\nIn order to blame the two, 『Lycoris』 did whatever she could think of. She didn’t care, not even when it hurt her, not even when it hurt not just those two, but those around her.\nIf she couldn’t have it, she wanted to destroy it as viciously as she could. The only thing she wouldn’t allow was a future where the two became happy instead of her.\nEven though everyone left her side soon after that, 『Lycoris』 still didn’t admit it. That in the end, she never loved anyone. Never trusted anyone.\nEven after I woke up, for some time, I was overcome with surprise.\n「That’s not it. I... wouldn’t do that. I definitely won’t. I’m telling the truth, really...」\nSetting my body upright on my bed, I continued to explain, not knowing who I was trying to address my explanation to.\nI’ve heard theories that you see dreams to feel relieved. Good dreams to think, 『it’s great that I saw a good dream』. And bad dreams to think,『it’s great that a frightful thing like that isn’t real』.\nSuch a thing was a lie, I thought. At least, regarding this bad dream in particular.\nI saw a dream again.\nIn that dream, I was playing the actual game. Wolf’s route.\nI played with the aim of getting the true end. The degree of difficulty was hard enough that I always had to prevent myself from making a mistake in the choices, but, since it was a comparatively happy story even in the game, it was my favorite.\nSince he hated women, he had a perpetual dour look in the beginning. The speech and conduct of the Wolf in-game and the current Wolf was quite different. Maybe it was because he seemed to be overexerting himself, or that he seemed to be putting up a bold front, I felt I couldn’t leave him alone.\nBut, by deepening the relationship with him little by little, his naturally earnest disposition gradually came into view.\nThe trauma that he was inflicted with would be overcome together. When I watched him talking about his deceased father, it felt as if my heart would be wrenched out.\nAnd so, the story approached the happy ending. In the other side of my terminal screen, the lovers — Lily and Wolf– smiled happily at each other and exchanged a kiss.\nWhen I came to, I muttered「I feel like an idiot」. I feel like my heart would tear if I hadn’t treated it as a wild, idiotic delusion.\nSo, I decided, this time for sure, I wouldn’t fall asleep again.\nEven though my resolution was supposed to be firm, nearing the break of dawn, I saw yet another dream.\nThat was the shortest and the most frightening dream I had.\nA single woman was standing there.\nLong black hair. Black eyes. Though beautiful, her expression, in some way, was cold.\nI didn’t remember her, but I did know her.\n「Poor girl」\nHer voice, a voice I shouldn’t have had any way of hearing, resounded. A voice quite similar to mine.\n「You’ll never be able to truly love someone. You’re my daughter, you’re really just like me. Broken. We’re a bloodline that goes mad with jealousy」\nShe reached out a hand to my cheeks. That hand that was viciously cold made me certain she wasn’t of the living.\n「You mustn’t fall in love with anyone. After all, that will end up leading to their misfortune... and to yours」\nStop it, I cried out.\nMother, stop it!\nWith the sound of that cry, I came to.\nCovered in heavy sweat, the night dress clinging to my skin felt uncomfortable.\nMore than that, it was terrifying since it felt as if the black fog was clinging to my body. Considering the cause of the bad dreams, wasn’t this evidently the『curse』?\nEven though I received the doctor’s diagnosis yesterday, it didn’t necessarily give me peace of mind. That’s because Gift was a rare genius, and the true nature of the black fog was never discovered in the end.\nI gasped, springing up from the bed.\n（Wolf!）\nI’m worried that Wolf had exposed himself to the black fog when he shielded me.\nI went to the male dormitory in hot haste, but, I wasn’t able to meet with Wolf in the end. He, himself, firmly refused to meet with me, after all",

      "content": "School Arc – Chapter 17 (Shade’s POV)\nTurning her head after being called 「Elder Sister」, Lycoris wore a slightly anxious expression when she saw my face. Only when I’d smiled, did a slight almost non-existent smile creep up the corners of her mouth in small relief.\nIt’s an appearance that must never be shown to the likes of those guys in my class who’ve commonly treated her like a flower on a cliff.\nEven though my sister was going in and out of the female dormitory’s medical office with the reason being that she was in poor health, every time I’d return to the male dormitory, my friends would keep pestering me with a “how is she?” to no end.\nI feel like I should be the one pressing someone for answers. Like, “what the heck is going on right now?”.\nIt’s only hearsay, but based on what Miss Lilium had apparently said, the order of events which occurred in these past few days, went like this.\nThe day Art harassed her, Lilium chased after the bird. She’d said, that, while chasing after the blue shadow, her feet took her to the guest house, and then, she moved further and further underground. If she considered the bigger picture, this would’ve been the moment she realized that there was something strange, but by then, she might have already been under some sort of spell. (1)\nAbout this blue bird, it seems like it’s a kind of probing magic that the lunatic continued casting even while he was practically unconscious, this was according to the guest house’s librarian assigned as the watchdog, Mr. Hemlock.\nIn any case, when Lilium chased after it, it purposely led her to the innermost part of the basement. When the bird came crashing down having used up its power, Lilium directed all the healing magic she had on it, which resulted in the revival of that sleeping lunatic. From that moment on, the madman began using Lilium’s eyes to view the outside world.\nWhat happened after that had some conjectures mixed in, but it likely went like this.\nWhen that guy, who seemed to be crazy about Miss Lilium, awoke, he immediately took action. It seems like the guy was some sort of genius in magic. Not only mind magic but even wind magic was up on his forte. He likely used a mind manipulation magic on Art to make him fall down the stairs. As for Art’s entourage, if you look at it from the lunatic’s perspective, they’d been caught red-handed. With no room to argue, glass shards poured over their heads.\nOn top of all that, he was even\ncourteous\nenough to fire off magic at someone’s sister in place of a greeting before he left.\nBe it day or night, Lycoris was tormented by nightmares — Wolf was too, but that’s besides the point...\nWhen she slept, without fail, she’d see dreams that condensed all her fears and insecurities. This was already on the same level as a mind attack. Since this spell wasn’t information inside the magic system owned by the association, no one knows how to deal with it.\nIt seems like my sister had turned to strongly fearing the things she was dreaming of. As a result, during these two days in reality, her condition was visibly poor and her mind was unstable.\nOf course, even the school couldn’t afford to just fold their arms and watch, but, they couldn’t come up with a substantially effective measure against it.\nOn the same day that Gift – the lunatic – appeared, it seems several people including Mr. Hemlock headed down to the guest house’s basement. What they saw there was the black fog that attacked Lycoris and Wolf. They’ve been going back again and again, and were at their wits end with it.\nThe black fog seemed to have also begun causing a considerable influence inside the school. Maybe thanks to my aptitude to mind magic, I still haven’t shown any signs of it, but be that as it may, I could feel unrest in the air through my skin. Fights, while trivial, were becoming frequent in the male dormitory. Although they were brought up as young masters from well-to-do families, it wasn’t strange for quarrels to happen when men around my age assemble. Nevertheless, the frequency of commotions today had been abnormal.\nAlthough they haven’t shown as much remarkable symptoms as Lycoris and Wolf, I don’t know what will happen in the future. Perhaps in the end it would be an epidemic of nightmares.\nFor now, Art, who was known to be synonymous to the『source of mayhem』, had to be tied down even if it was to the bed.\n「Shade, how’s Lily?」\nOn top of the bed with her back supported by the cushion, Lycoris inquired.\n「It’s useless. It looks like she still hasn’t woken up」\nRight after Lilium had spoken about the situation, she fell into a coma as if using up all her strength.\nI don’t have the heart to say this in front of my sister, but from the words that lunatic left behind, I’m guessing until the very day the madman from the basement comes for her, she’ll likely continue sleeping.\n「I see. But, Lily isn’t seeing nightmares, right?」\nHer voice was so anxious that I couldn’t make myself reply with something like, ‘if you’re so worried, go take a look yourself’.\n「She’s fine. By the way, Elder Sister. I’ve applied for you to recuperate from home today」\nEven when I informed her of what I did without consulting with her even once, Lycoris’s reaction was dull. Since it was out of character of her to be so out of it, this simply made me more uneasy.\n「...Eh?」\n「Even if you stay here in that condition, you wouldn’t be of any use, right? At any rate, it’s better for you to be away from the academy right now」\nWith a lecture that was just a little stern, those black eyes clouded.\nPlease stop it. Honestly, I’m begging you, please stop it.\n「Seems like Duke Lilia will come pick you up himself. You’ve had him worried」\n「Father will...?」\nNow that I’ve hit her weak spot, I finally got her attention, so I felt relieved.\n「Will you... also go home with me?」\n「I won’t. I’m sort of a prefect, so I have work to do at times like these」\n「I’m... the dormitory head」\n「The management of the dormitory is basically the prefect’s work. Since the the dormitory head’s work is pretty much to lie back and relax, it doesn’t matter whether you’re here or not」\n「... I wonder what Wolf would do」\nThat... was the source of many headaches.\nIt had been only yesterday when Elder Sister cried to me saying『Wolf won’t meet with me』.\nNot fully grasping the situation since I had just gotten up, I grumbled to myself wondering why I had to act like some sort of messenger for these two while I took my sister along to see Wolf, who was usually hanging around the training fields early in the morning.\nSince Wolf had a bad habit of simply working out on the training fields whenever he was angry, I did wonder whether something had happened. But the complexity of the situation had far exceeded my expectations.\nTo start with, as soon as Wolf saw that I was followed by my sister, he glared at me with a brutal look that was all but ready to kill. Coupled with a terrible complexion, it was an incredibly evil expression.\nAlthough I didn’t know what had happened, when I looked at Lycoris’s face, it made me wonder whether it cheered her up, but even then, strangely enough, my sister kept her distance and didn’t really approach Wolf.\nAfter seeing my sister’s behaviour, Wolf’s expression became increasingly steely, and this, conversely made my sister wither even further. I’ve been with these two for along time, but this is the first time I’ve seen the two fall into a vicious cycle. It’s a different matter if it were the opposite.\nSince that was how I felt even though I was only a bystander, I wonder just how bewildered the actual people felt.\nFinally, Wolf, who looked like he was putting up with a great deal of pain uttered these words.\n『... sorry, Lycoris. Please don’t come to me. Right now I’ll... likely only hurt you』\nWhile uttering those words, he stared at Lycoris with a burning gaze. Since he was making excessively sparkly eyes, if the situation had permitted it, I’d have joked around like usual saying,『if you’re that frustrated, then just sleep with a girl or something』, but, well, I’m glad I didn’t say that.\nFor the time being, before Wolf could say anything else that would hurt Lycoris even more, I pulled her hands and turned back. Of course, the gaze piercing my back had been very painful.\nAfter that, Lycoris hadn’t said anything about wanting to meet Wolf. Since the actual people hadn’t said anything about what they were seeing in their nightmares, I could only try to guess, but from the state Lycoris was in, her dream was probably related to Wolf.\n「At any rate, please get plenty of rest at home, Elder Sister. I’ll try to deal with it till then. If it comes down to it, Wolf will sleep if I hit him hard in the head with a blunt object anyway. As for Miss Lilium... I don’t know whether she’ll wake up with a prince’s kiss, but I’ll try it out」\n「... are you okay, Shade?」\nWithout even scolding me for the inappropriate words, Lycoris anxiously looked up at me.\n「Really, you lost your cuteness as you grew taller... your inappropriate jokes gets worse when you’re driven to a wall, right?」\nWith a gentle smile creeping up the corners of her mouth like a surprise attack, I couldn’t bear to look down.\n「... for now, please prepare to go home」\nSaying only that, I drove my sister away from the medical office.\nI resisted the reckless urge to hit a wall.\nI don’t care whether he’s a lunatic or a mummy, but, selfishly involving my sister in his love affair was no joke\nI don’t know whether the choice to make Lycoris go home was the right one. Wolf’s nightmare was certainly a dream about her. If she’s separated from him, his mental state will likely only get worse.\nEven then, this was the only way I could help her right now, even if it’s just a second quicker, I want to pull her out of this chaos. If she’s with her father then even Elder Sister should feel a little at ease.\nIf someday, even I start seeing in a nightmares...\nIt’ll surely be a nightmare of my own powerlessness.",

      "content": "School Arc – Chapter 18\nWolf told me something like ‘I’ll only hurt you, so don’t come near me’.\nThe words,『It’s okay even if I get hurt, I want to be by your side』, were at the tip of my tongue. But I didn’t say them in the end.\nI mean, Wolf was a person who’d always been by my side in order to protect me from harm.\nThey were also words that would betray the family who loved me.\nEven so, maybe I should have said it.\nIf I did, maybe I would’ve been by Wolf’s side right now.\nWhat would Lily do if it was her? I wanted to hear the answer to that. Even though I ought to know that now wasn’t the time for this, I found myself thinking of nothing but that. That’s because, she’s someone who... does the right thing, after all.\nThe answer that I’ll arrive at definitely won’t be the right one.\nSoon, Father arrived at school.\nI was actually a little afraid of seeing Father face-to-face. I’d been warned by him countless of times, scolded, and in the end, abandoned... aah, no, wrong. That... was in a dream.\nSince he’s very sharp at subtle signs, I was terrified that Father might end up finding out about what I was seeing in my nightmares as well.\nHowever, in reality, Father just gave me a very gentle smile and simply said ‘let’s go back home’. Maybe I relaxed since I was so happy, I dozed off and fell asleep in the carriage on our way home. As expected of course, a nightmare quickly followed after.\nEven after we returned home, Father didn’t ask me anything.\nHe never asked me anything, but he did constantly check up on me while I was in bed. It was somewhat... a little funny.\n「Father, what about work?」\nI meant to be considerate of him, but my words caused Father to make a sad expression.\n「...I’m sorry」\n「No, you did nothing wrong. It’s just, whenever I think of the times you’ve said those words to me up til now, it makes me feel pathetic」\n「Father, you aren’t pathetic」\n「No, I am. Actually, Lycoris. Right now, I don’t know what kind of nightmares you’re facing. I don’t know what to do to help you」\nFather made a somewhat helpless expression and took a seat at the edge of my bed. I’d thought that if it was Father, he’d be able to see through my mind without any problems, but that didn’t seem to be the case.\n「I guess even you, Father, have people you don’t understand and get puzzled over, huh...」\nAfter saying that, I was hit by a sudden overwhelming sense of deja vu. I feel like I’ve said something like this to Father before.\nThat’s right, wasn’t it when we were talking about Uncle Narcissus? (1)\nAnd, what on earth was it that Father had answered with?\nI couldn’t distinctly recall the memory I should’ve been able to, but it was as if the mist somehow clouded it. Thankfully, however, Father continued on, giving me words that was like his response then.\n「That’s natural. To begin with, since a very long time ago, I honestly had no idea what my daughter really wants or what she might think of me」\n「Eh...?」\n「Honestly, I’m a pathetic father. Since you were young, you’ve been a very mature child, you’d already learnt restraint before you could ask anything selfish of me. No, because I wasn’t by your side, I might not have even given you a chance to ask anything selfish」\n「That... isn’t...」\nI did build a mental wall against my father in the past. Not knowing my father, I did feel lonely and uneasy. Is Father saying he felt the same way?\nAt any rate, I had to tell him these next words no matter what, so I got up from bed and spoke.\n「I don’t think you’re pathetic, Father. I mean, when I was at the Rankgerüste mansion, you rushed over, beat up Uncle Narcissus, and hugged me tight. I thought to myself, while I’m in your arms, nothing bad will happen」\nFather slowly stretched his large hands around me, wrapping me in warmth.\nHow long has it been since Father hugged me? For a period in time when I enrolled into the academy, I think I’d been hugged each time I returned home. I should be way older now than I was then, but the sense of security hasn’t changed at all.\nAnd so, this warmth sparked the little bit of courage left in me.\n「Father. There’s something I wanted to ask you since long ago, but I never got to ask it」\n「What is it?」\n「...Father, did you ever love Mother?」\nUpon my words, Father seemed incredibly surprised.\n「Why do you ask something like that? ... Did someone say something to you?」\n「It’s already been a long time ago... but, Uncle Narcissus did tell me something」\n「Narcissus?」\nThere was a sharp edge to Father’s tone that I shivered a little.\n「Aah, I’m sorry. I’m not angry at you. But, I see, so it was Narcissus, huh...」\nI felt a hint of agitation in Father’s tone.\nSubsequently after we took in Shade, Aunt and Crinum cut off all ties with Uncle Narcissus, and he was then fired from the job of managing the territory. Last I asked Father about him, I was simply told that he was in some foreign country.\n「...well, that guy doesn’t matter right now.『Did I ever love her?』, you ask? That’s not quite right」\nUpon Father’s words, my heart plummeted. As though to stop that, he hugged me tightly and said:\n「...even to this day, I still love her」\nHe said in an earnest tone.\nThis was the first I’ve heard Father speak this way since I was born.\n「The truth is, you might have needed a woman to replace your mother, and perhaps I should have had a second marriage. But I couldn’t do it. My wife could only be her alone, I couldn’t take anyone else, that’s what I realized」\nThat’s right. Father had all but brushed the numerous talks of a second wife aside. I should know, I’ve even seen it happen in person when I was with him.\n「...but, I’ve heard that Mother was a very jealous person」\n「She was a passionate woman. That’s also what I loved about her」\n‘Really?’, when I inclined my head questioningly, Father continued with a flustered smile.\n「Her affection was like a burning flame. I’d certainly been a little concerned. Though it was because I wanted to continue being with her in peace for even longer. But even as she lay sick in bed, she never changed. Even in her last moments, she was still the same」\n「...was she a lovely person?」\n「Yeah, she was. It was a wonderful love. That’s why that love was able to produce the most wonderful gem of all – you」\nWhen Father proudly proclaimed those words, I felt as if the mist cleared away in front of my eyes.\n「I don’t know what Narcissus told you. But, you can just ignore what he said. It doesn’t matter what others thought of our love.... Oh, that’s right. I have something nice to show you」\nAfter he said that, Father rushed out of the room and quickly came back, holding something covered in cloth.\n「This is what I wanted to show you, but as I thought, it’s still a little embarrassing」\nBashfully saying so, Father uncovered the cloth, and what came to sight was a single painting.\nIt was a painting of a smiling woman holding a small baby in her arms.\n「I... painted this」\n「Eh?」\n「This girl is you. When you were just born」\nThen... could the person holding the baby in her arms be... my Mother?\nAlthough the painting might not be what you’d call skillful, the woman had been drawn with a gentle touch. Sure, she had black hair. Black eyes. But her expression was quite different to the one I’ve seen in other paintings of my mother.\nHer expression was brimming with nothing but affection. With her cheeks pressed closely to the baby she was holding in her arms, it looked as if she was showing off the baby to whoever was looking.\n「Your mother was shy of strangers. Whenever she was asked to have a painting made of her, she’d somehow make a stiff expression every time. I should’ve shown this to you sooner. It’s just... this... is really embarrassing, isn’t it? But, this expression of hers in particular, was a look that only I could draw. She didn’t show this expression to anyone else but me, her...」\nHanging his head down, it seemed as if Father was holding back his tears.\nWhen I saw Father this way, when I saw the painting, I understood perfectly. That the mother I saw in my nightmares was nothing more than a figment of my imagination.\nI suppose it was an imitation made from a blend of both Uncle Narcissus’s words and my own insecurities.\nMy heart swelled, feeling sorry for Mother. What plagued me was not Mother’s blood or anything of that sort. It was simply my fears and insecurities alone.\n「...it must be painful to lose someone you love. But even then, Father, did you ever regret loving Mother?」\n「Never. Even though I wish I’d had more time with her, I never regretted anything」\n「Do you think I’ll be able to love like that?」\n「Of course. You’re our daughter after all」\nFather’s wore a look that seemed to wonder why I was even asking something as obvious as that.\nAnd so, with a push on my back, I strengthened my resolve.\n「...Father, I want to go back to the academy. I have to go back」\nFather looking intently into my eyes for a while, but he eventually gave up and smiled indulgently at me.\n「...I see. Then, in the meantime, sleep properly until the flush comes back to your cheeks. While you’re sleeping, I’ll prepare the souvenirs you’ll bring to school」\n「??」\n「Sweet dreams, Lycoris」\nUnable to overcome the lull of the futon and his gentle voice, I went to sleep all too quickly.\nI didn’t see even a single dream, it had been a very deep slumber.\nAuthor’s note:\nAn absolutely disquieting tidbit: though her father’s artistic taste are clear in the story now, there are plenty of people in the Duke Lilia bloodline who can draw well. Uncle Narcissus is one such person, his room is filled with many, many (endless) pictures of his beloved grandmother’s figure and face, with her eyes the only thing colored.\nWhen I summarize the current chapter, it feels like the rule,『It’s not worth believing what Uncle Narcissus says』, rivals this story’s golden rule of『Once you forget a Yandere, he will come』.\nAnyway, it’s time for Lycoris’s awaited counterattack. First is a one-on-one at Wolf’s place!\nTranslator’s notes:\n(1) Family-Hen Chapter 2 if you want to relook what happened.",

      "content": "The sun was just about to set when I, who’d remained asleep for nearly the entire day, returned to the academy with Father.\nThe one who came to greet us was Shade. He put on an expression as if nothing was wrong, but fatigue was evidently showing from the corners of his eyes. He probably had it tough with the matters at school, and I might’ve worried him quite a lot too.\nWhen Shade saw my face, he smiled as if letting out a breath he was holding in.\n「You’re looking a little better」\n「Sorry, Shade, I’ve been a burden to you」\n「...what commendable words when you’re going to neglect your brother after this and head off to your fiance」\nShade made a wry smile but discussed Wolf with me and Father along the way.\nHe told us that Wolf had now secluded himself in his own room and wasn’t even eating his meals.\nThere had been talks to send Wolf back home to recuperate like I did, but it seems the person himself firmly declined.\nWolf extremely despised exposing his weak side in front of his father, the Duke Ranunculus. I’m sure his relationship with his father wasn’t bad, but I sometimes wonder even if it wasn’t strained. The relationship between a father and a son, as I imagine, might be different from the relationship I had with my father, though.\nAt times, I’ve tried telling Wolf that if he’d act spoiled now and then, it would even make the duke happy. But Wolf would simply make a wry smile and tell me, “maybe, but it’s pretty difficult”.\nThere isn’t anything that comes to mind when talking about Wolf’s weak points, but if I had to think of one, it would be that he was no good at being spoiled.\nI stared at the door to Wolf’s room and thought. Even now, he was fighting the nightmares alone inside this room without asking anyone for help.\n「Well, I’ll be talking to him for a bit」\nAfter informing my father and brother with a deliberately light tone, I placed a hand on the knob with the tray that held liquid food and water that I’d taken from the kitchen on my left hand.\nWolf’s room was as silent as a grave.\nWhen I closed the door behind me, the sound reverberated across the room very loudly.\nThen, it turned dark.\nRather than saying it’s because the sun was setting, it’s because the heavy curtains were obstructing the bright light that was still coming from outside completely.\nOnly the light from a small magical lamp was evident in the dark room.\nDid he forget to put the lamp under the sun at noon? The light was almost used up and was barely lighting the room.\nWolf was on top of his bed. The futon had ended up falling to the floor, but that didn’t bother me. What concerned me was that Wolf remained quietly lying on top of the terribly wrinkled sheets. Because his eyes were concealed under both hands, I can’t tell the expression on his face.\n「...Wolf?」\nWhen I called out to him, his arms jolted a little. It seemed he wasn’t asleep.\n「Uhm, sorry to barge in without permission. But I have something I wanted to talk to you about...」\nFor a short time, there was silence.\nTaking advantage of the fact that he didn’t start blaming me about what happened, I edged closer to his bed, bit by bit.\nWhen I came close enough, I found Wolf gasping in pain. I set the tray on top of the waist-high drawer I spotted when my eyes got a little used to the darkness.\n「Wolf, I brought along water and food. First, have some wate...」\nMy words were interrupted by an arm that sluggishly reached out to grab my wrist.\n「Did you... come back for me, Lycoris?」\nIt was painful to hear the horrible crack in his voice. But, I’m happy to hear his voice all the same.\n「Yeah. I got back just a little while ago」\nWhen I answered, I peeked into Wolf’s eyes. But, his blue-violet eyes seemed somewhat unfocused that I was having doubts whether he was even paying attention.\n「...Wolf?」\nRight in front of the puzzled me, Wolf’s expression twisted.\nNot only did the corner of his mouth lift up in a cynical smile, a dangerous glint also appeared in his eyes, it was an expression I couldn’t imagine on Wolf. I ended up being pinned down by the piercing gaze of those vivid blue-violet eyes.\n「And so? Who on earth will the person you love be this time?」\nI only drew back after he said this because I’d been surprised. That’s all.\nBut Wolf, as if telling me he wasn’t going to let me run away, pulled my wrist with enough strength as to be painful. I was dragged along and ended up getting thrown on top of the bed.\nLocking me in place on the bed, Wolf’s expression twisted yet again. This time, he grimaced in pain, and as if he was squeezing the words out of his lips, he pleaded with me .\n「...please don’t say it. I’m begging you... please don’t make me go insane」\nHe said it in a tone that made my heart ache.\n「No more... being cast aside by you, going insane from jealousy then killing them... making you hate me because of that, making you cry.... Being forsaken by Father... I can’t take it anymore. I don’t want to lose you... I’m begging you...」\n「It was just a dream, Wolf」\nWhen I touched his cheeks with the hand that he wasn’t holding on to, Wolf instantly opened his eyes as if startled.\n「... that maybe so. But, they weren’t just dreams」\n「What do you mean?」\nIt doesn’t look like Wolf was talking entirely in his sleep.\nHe may have been shifting back and forth between his dreams and reality that he could no longer tell the difference. For now, at least, he was talking with the closest he had to awareness. As testament to that, his blue-violet eyes were locked into mine.\n「When I destroyed everything there... even though it was supposed to be a nightmare, I felt relieved inside the dream. I had no way to change your mind anymore」\n「What you want inside a dream doesn’t reflect what you actually want. They’re just nightmares that embody the things you’re frightened of」\n「It would’ve been okay if that’s all the nightmares were about」\nWolf’s words were contrary to my expectations.\n「What truly frightens me... What these nightmares are showing me... is that I might not be able to stop myself from hurting you for real」\n「...eh?」\n「Even after I woke up, I kept thinking. After this, you’ll debut into high society. Even if it’s you, once you’re there, you’ll clearly realize enough not to misunderstand what others feel about you. You’re a desirable woman. You can have your pick of other men. Then, when you come to your senses, you’ll end up leaving me. If that’s going to happen, then...」\nWolf’s hands, this time, gently reached out to my neck.\nThose blue-violet eyes captured me. That earnest look was an expression that I knew to be Wolf’s. I knew, at this moment, he was himself.\n「... I’d rather kill you now」\nSurprised as I was, in front of me, as if his own words surprised him, tears rolled and spilled out from those blue-violet eyes.\nWas it strange to say that when I heard those words and saw his tears, I felt warmth brimming in my chest?\nAt this moment, I could no longer talk my way out of thinking about how dear Wolf was to me. Even when he was strong, even when he was weak, even when he was suffering, and even when he was loving someone.\nThat’s why I smiled at Wolf, in order to relay these feelings as much as I could.\n「It’s okay. There’s nothing to be afraid of. After all, there’s now way you’d ever hurt me, Wolf」\nTaking the big hands that were merely holding on to my neck, I pressed them against my cheeks.\n「I know for sure that Wolf really, reaaally loves me... I do too, I like you, you know. I like you very, very much. I love you. That’s why it’s fine if you act a little spoiled with me」\nOvercome with surprise, Wolf didn’t say anything to me, even after a while.\nMy face rapidly reddened, maybe it was because I was being overly self-conscious, but the words made an echo in my head.\nBefore I could cry out with a “Anything is fine, just say something!”, Wolf whispered fervently in my ear.\n「I love you... I’m not letting go again, so, be prepared」\nJust like that, Wolf embraced me, sending me to my wits’ end.\nI could hear the palpitating sound of my heart thumping loudly, and I don’t mean the circulation of my blood was getting cut off, it was more of, while late, I finally realized the situation we were in: two people on top of a bed.\nWolf wears his usual getup even when brandishing a sword on the training field, so this was a rare casual wear for him. With his sleeves rolled up, two buttons unfastened from his shirt, I can feel his body heat. That wasn’t all there was, there was also the sound of rustling clothes and his fervent breaths.\nAlthough I’d always thought of them as just 『Wolf’s hands』 up till now, I became keenly aware of their body heat just now. Big hands crawled down my lower back, then his rough skin which had formed from handling swords, touched my skin and gave me goosebumps.\nI felt relieved when Wolf parted from me, but then, he buried his head on my neck and kissed it. Surprised and stunned, I ended up shouting.\n「Hey – wait! Wolf!?」\nBam!\n, came Father, making the noise when he opened the door, then my younger brother rushed in and made the exact same frozen expression as my father.\nAs for Wolf, he fell asleep as if losing consciousness, just like that.",

      "content": "School Arc – Chapter 20\nEven when the possibility of other people coming into the room shot up, even as I squirmed my way out from under him, I wasn’t able to wake Wolf halfway through his comatosed sleep.\n『We weren’t pricking up our ears to listen in, you know. Or perhaps I should say... with the thick doors, we couldn’t hear anything to start with. We simply got surprised by the scream...』, when my little brother let the cat out of the bag, I eyed my father with suspicion as my father laughed to cover up his embarrassment, but, since I was sure I had them worried, I couldn’t get angry at them.\nThen, Father hurriedly ran away. I suppose his parting words that he had business with the school faculty was no lie at least.\nAs for Shade, it seems like he planned to escort me until I reached the women’s dormitory, so this also led him to walk briskly on.\n「Shade, I think it would be better if you rest. You’re looking a little pale」\n「I’m a handsome fair-skinned young man by nature, you know」\n「... yes, a handsome fair-skinned young man listening in with his ear pressed to the door, what a picture-perfect sight that turned out to be indeed」\nEven though I replied back with words filled with sarcasm, for some reason, Shade pulled a happy-looking smile.\n「I knew it... you’re really tired, aren’t you?」\nI said it worriedly, actually really serious, but he replied 「how rude」 sounding somewhat lively.\n「You really did get better, didn’t you, Elder Sister?」\nIn the end, he said that sort of thing with a look that said 『what a relief』 , so I ended up at a loss for words.\nWolf also leaves me speechless from time to time by saying embarrassing things. But, this sort of honest attitude coming from Shade still left me wondering how I should respond to it in its own way.\n「Uuhm...I’m truly sorry for all the worry I caused this time...」\n「It’s unlike you to apologise, so please stop」\nHaving been flatly cut off, I decided to change the topic.\n「I wonder... how many do you think fell victim to nightmares in the end?」\n「Who knows. Even if you trust my self-assessment of the situation, we can’t really tell the difference between those caused by magic to those that are simply just nightmares」\n「Did you not see nightmare, Shade?」\n「Yeah, the way I train is different so it doesn’t affect me」\nWhen I was about to reply back that training had nothing to do with anything, I realized Shade wasn’t looking in my direction. With his stubborn profile looking straight ahead, I felt uncomfortable for some reason.\n「Hey, is that really the truth...?」\nThis time, he didn’t answer back. With Shade keeping silent altogether, I sighed.\nShade had seen a nightmare. But, in the current situation, it doesn’t seem like he’ll obediently tell me what his nightmare was about. Right now, it’s not evident enough to show in his physical condition, though.\n「How stubborn」\nEven my muttering was ignored.\nIf I compared Shade with Wolf, I think Shade still lets other people spoil him. But even then, it’s not like he asks me advice on just about everything. Maybe it had to do with his self-respect or maybe his pride as a man, I wager it was probably something along those lines.\nShade had ended up walking on at a brisk pace, so we were almost at the women’s dormitory.\n「Shade, do you have any questions for me?」\n「Questions？」\n「That’s right. I am the first to conquer the nightmares, right? So, if you have any question, I’ll answer them for you」\n「Then, let’s hear it at least. What’s the secret to overcoming the nightmares?」\nEven though I wished he’d ask for my advice, he asked only for a fool-proof way to beat the nightmares. Well, if wishes were horses, beggars would ride. Nevertheless, I answered him in earnest.\n「The thing is... it was love!」\n*Do~n*.\nEven though I’d say that it was pretty well said, would you believe it, after a pause, Shade had the audacity to clutch his stomach in laughter.\n「Isn’t it rude of you to start laughing!? I was being serious...!」\n「I’m sorry, I’d been expecting it to be some kind of deeply profound words...」\nHe was trying to downplay it by putting on a docile expression, but he eventually burst out laughing after that.\n「You’re not making this any better, you know! 」\n「N-No... really, it’s not like I’m complaining, you know. It’s just... I was caught off guard...」\n「... if you’re laughing that vigorously, then looks like you’re OK」\n「That... might be so. I’m probably stronger than you’d expect. At any rate, I am your brother after all」\nWhen Shade finally stopped rolling over in laughter, a playboy smile deliberately graced his face.\n「But just to be sure, please give me your love too, Elder Sister」\n「What are you saying all of a sudden?」, I said with a snort.\n「There’s no way I wouldn’t love my one and only precious little brother, right?」\nShade looked amazed at my declaration, then replied with a slightly bright expression.\n「...I wonder about that」\nContrary to those dishonest words, his cheeks were a little red.\nNaturally. Rather than from him feeling my love, the fact that he’d been rolling around in laughter earlier was more likely the cause of the reddening.\nResolving to have Shade go to see Father later, I headed to where Lily was.\nI wasn’t heading to Lily’s own room, but rather, the female dormitory’s medical office.\nThe cause of her comatose state was a different nature to that of the black fog so I heard they’ve been performing various medical treatments on her for the chance at recovery. Despite the fact that there should’ve been a way to wake her up if it was only a spell to induce sleep, even now, they still haven’t come up with a counter spell. Generally speaking, the non-standard quality of Gift’s magic made it very troublesome.\n「But, her condition is a little off today」, remarked the medical office doctor.\n「Did her condition get worse?」\nI frantically inspected Lily’s countenance, but, there wasn’t any particular difference.\n「No, quite the contrary. It looks like she’s gaining awareness. She’s responding to the ambient sounds」\nWhen the doctor called out a 「Liliam」, Lily’s eyelashes twitched several times in response to her call.\n「Lily! Lily! Can you hear me?」\nI raised my voice too, and this time, even though it was only lightly, her eyelids opened.\nThen, Lily’s small hands reached out unsteadily to me as if asking for help, so I immediately took her hand in mine.\n「Lily, you’ve finally come to」\n「...Ly...coris?」\nLily’s verdure green eyes, though still in a daze, had certainly reflected me.\nThe medical office didn’t turn boisterous all of a sudden. It was good news that Lily has finally woken up, but if we don’t understand the cause we still need to be wary for any movements from Gift.\nUltimately, it took time until we determined that there were no changes in the school. In this regard, since several students with sharp intuition have testified that 『for the time being, the black fog hanging in the air was fading at the school 』 , our theory held true.\nThe damage of the black fog was mainly having me, Wolf, as well as the others see nightmares, it seems like students complaining about not feeling well had been a plenty. There was a sharp distinction between Lily’s symptoms and ours, but the theory was that the cause of her coma was also the black fog.\nIn other words, with Wolf and I, the main victims, overcoming that fog, we surmised that since the magic effects on our bodies were fading away, Lily would probably be waking up as well.\nThey say that even the fog that had been blocking the path to the guest house’s basement was fading away. That is, they say that Gift lost the barrier that had been blocking others from trespassing.\nI don’t know what he’s going to unleash next time, but one thing’s for sure, if he remains left alone in the school, he will continue to pose a threat to the public.\nI dare say, it’ll probably turn into offensive attacks from here on.\n(unedited)",

      "content": "School Arc – Chapter 21 (Lily’s POV)\nThat place had been a very peaceful place.\nWithout seeing anyone, without hearing anyone, there wasn’t anyone to bother me. In here, there wasn’t anyone who’d hurt me.\nBut, when she called out my name, 「Lily」, I realized that that place was an incredibly lonely place.\nWhen I took her hand, I realized that that place had been an incredibly cold place.\nWhen I saw her eyes turn from a look of worry to a look that sparkled with happiness, I realized, nothing in there had touched my heart.\nWhen I woke up, surprisingly enough, several days had passed, so I was attacked by a wave of unease and frustration. After listening to what had happened when I was asleep, I learned that although they knew about the main culprit, they couldn’t do anything about the situation.\nThat was why the proposal from Duke Lilia was truly a godsend for me.\nThat person turned up around the time the hustle and bustle around me calmed down after I woke up at the medical office.\nWhen that person — Lycoris’s father — appeared from behind the school chairman, someone who I’ve only seen once upon entering the school, I ended up distraught with the misunderstanding that someone had finally turned up to convict me.\nBut, the truth of the matter was, Duke Lilia had come to me to offer a proposal.\nTo start with, the duke introduced himself, saying that he was here by the will of His Majesty the King. Then, upon seeing me tremble at that, spoke gently to soothe me.\n「You are a student under the protection of the school, for the current issue, many of us believe that you are the victim. Now, what I’m about to say is a proposal and not an order. You have the right to refuse, so I’d like you to listen with peace of mind」\nEven so, my body trembled in dread.\n「...it’s alright. I won’t say that you did nothing wrong, but bearing the consequences of a child’s mistakes is the duty of an adult」\nAll of a sudden, it dawned on me, ‘the person in front of me was no doubt Lycoris’s father’, I thought. With that, like a charm, my fear faded away. I nodded many times over, and this time, steeled myself so as not to miss a word of what the duke had to say.\nFor one, reviving Gift with healing magic had been understood to be done not out of my free will.\nFor another, keeping my meeting with Gift a secret after that was deemed a cause in making the situation more serious, although it wasn’t really a crime.\nAnd finally, he told me that there were circumstances that deemed me a danger to the school– and consequently, to the country and the association. The duke explained everything to me while also mixing in explanations of the organization, including the setup on how the association operates under the country’s contributions.\nThe specifics of why I was treated as a danger was, of course, due to the suspicion of being someone who communicated with Gift in secret. And for the possibility that my magic itself would induce a situation like this in the future.\n「You might as well think that the present situation is largely disadvantageous for you. So I want to give a proposal on top of that. Would you accept the responsibility of going to the basement of the guest house to seal Gift Assis once more? The suspicion that you’re an accomplice would be wiped off with that and it can also display your usefulness. Of course, we’ll be doing everything we can to help you」\nIt took me a little while to realize that he was referring to that Gift. I didn’t know Gift’s family name, and it never occurred to me that he would have something like that.\n「You’re asking me... to seal Gift? Not kill him?」\n「That’s right」\nI don’t know the true intentions of the straight-faced duke, but the decision was probably the conclusion reached by both the country and the school, at least.\n「But, can I really do something like seal Gift?」\n「There is a way. And, you’re the most qualified to do it –」\nOnce the duke finished explaining the method, my answer was decided.\n「...Okay. I’ll... do it 」\nWaiting was more dangerous than not knowing what Gift had in store for us next. So after going through the minimal amount of preparations, we headed down the basement.\nFurther, and further down. To where it felt cold and damp. It was already plain to tell, but the journey had been very unpleasant.\nThe first time I came here, I didn’t even have the luxury to think about anything, I had only single-mindedly chased after the little bird.\nThe second time after that, I passed through here while under the little bird’s guidance. When Gift first met me, I’d been someone who’d been forced to live in misery because of my own powerful magic. Him being a『comrade』 in a sense, I had been quite delighted.\nIt’ll only sound like an excuse now, but maybe I’d been under Gift’s magic then, just as I suspected. After all, I didn’t consider this journey, which seemed as if I was passing through an abyss, to be terrifying then, and now that things have come to pass, it’s baffling why it never occurred to me to report his existence to the school.\nAnd now, accepting guidance from the older teachers of the school, I paid a great deal of care so as not to miss my footing while my trembling feet carried me down the stairs.\nIt was quite unexpected, but Duke Lilia, who became my travel companion, was looking after me so I wouldn’t fall down. Those teachers of the school, as if protecting the front and back, had proceeded along with magical lamps in hand while being vigilant to the area.\nHaving never imagined that the duke himself would accompany me, I was flustered at first, but even within this group, he was the most composed. Even when the journey was causing an optical illusion that seemed to continue on for eternity because the information my eyes were receiving was too little, it didn’t seem to affect him.\nSoon after, our party arrived at the deepest interior of the basement — to where Gift was.\nThere wasn’t a trace of the black fog that had once enshrouded us in that place, when we opened the door, Gift’s ghost-like figure was there. Since his real body was contained inside the coffin-like box, I was greeted by the sight of the semi-translucent Gift standing by its side. The usual scene I see.\nHe stared quietly at me, who’d brought in travelling companions. I think Gift realized a lot of things from it, but he didn’t avert his gaze from me.\nI suspect my captivation with this direct gaze was perhaps due to the work of manipulation magic. Although the most prominent of his features was probably his vivid blue hair, his deep green eyes that seemed to project the darkness was what attracted me the most.\nEven as I approached him, clad in a protection spell cast by the teachers, Gift never showed a hostile response. ‘He no longer has that power’, I thought. Although I can’t be negligent, Gift’s figure was more transparent than before, tenuously, I felt it wouldn’t be strange even if he disappears at any moment.\n『...why are you assisting them? Is it because that woman is there?』\nAlthough he spoke in a『voice』that, as always, didn’t come from his throat, I did not answer.\nGift continued on, convinced about my feelings.\n『Why do you trust someone who’s so different from you? Don’t you hate her? That woman has everything you’ve ever longed for. A lover, a family, a safe position, everything you’ve desperately wanted – she has it as if it’s only a matter of fact』\nGift knew my heart in detail, he knew my weaknesses and knew about the jealousy and envy.\nBut, I understood now. His manipulative words were, in the end, his own personal opinion, it wasn’t always the truth. Although he and I had similarities, there was an aspect that was crucially different.\n「...you would never have tried taking the hand that was offered to you, would you?」\n『What?』\n「That’s the key difference between you and me. I know the warmth of that hand now. That’s why, rather than turning her away, rather than being jealous, I don’t want to lose her, I just want to hold on」\nGift had tried satisfying it. The unquenchable thirst of mine. Indeed, that was something I’d longed for once.\nThe insecurity that I’d someday be abandoned was always kept inside me. Just as how my mother had abandoned me, just as my friends had abandoned me, I started to think, ‘won’t they all eventually grow distant and abandon me?’.\nAnd, while being forced to live without even a single person to talk to by my father, I’d felt that intensely torturous sense of isolation.\nI’d wanted to be someone who’d never spare time to suffer through that insecurity. I wanted to be strong enough so that no one could control me. For that, I didn’t care whether I’d end up losing myself. That was what I’d thought. But...\nMaking up my mind, I gripped the pendant on my chest, then took out a dagger from my breast pocket.\nThe hilt was undecorated, and it’s thin blade ran half as long as my arm. With that nondescript dagger, it was unlikely to pose a threat to the ghost-like Gift. But when I flooded it with magic, a pattern on the crystal-clear blade gradually spread.\nFeeling an impending crisis, Gift placed distance from me, but to begin with, this magical tool was not meant to stab someone. Carrying the dagger in my right hand to hold it up, I invoked my magic.\n『This is...』\nSomething invisible was gradually receding from Gift’s body. Mysteriously, I could tell this quite clearly.\nI was putting to use the only magic I could – healing magic. And, the magical tool I had on hand was a treasure of the royal family endowed with the power of 『retrogression』.(1)\nThe very person who lent this to me — the duke – was cautiously observing Gift. The teachers as well, expanded the barrier and prepared for Gift’s final resistance.\nBut Gift, as if he was only puzzled, stared intently at my eyes, and maybe there, he discovered my firm dismissal.\n『Even\nyou\nare rejecting me?』\nIt’s not as if I didn’t feel anything when I heard his words, heavy with dejection and despair. But, I’ve made up my mind.\n「I don’t mind even if you blame me for being disloyal. But, I did tell you. — If you hurt Lycoris, I won’t forgive you」\nWith my left hand, I gripped the pendant on my chest a second time.\nThe pendant had been passed down from my grandmother to my mother, and then, from my mother to me. When I was young, before I got my power, it was proof that I was definitely loved.\nWhenever I held this pendant tightly, I used to picture what my mother’s face looked like when she’d given it to me. I would imagine her wearing a gentle expression. I would imagine that my mother, who was a little younger in my memory, had on an expression that was vivid and bright. And, I would imagine that she used to look at me with love in her eyes.\nBut now, when I gripped the pendant tightly, a different face floated in my mind.\nWith tears in her eyes... it was her face I saw.\nWhen I talk about this pendant now, it was Lycoris’s face I saw.\nThat person, not knowing who I was before I revealed my abilities, was completely different from me even by social standings.\nBut she believed in the beautiful dream I spoke of.\nShe worried for me. Even when she was involved in something terrifying because of me, she was happy when I recovered. She offered her hand to me.\nWhen Gift tried to harm her, I made up my mind. I chose her over Gift. When I told him I wouldn’t forgive him, it wasn’t just something I said out of convenience to threaten him.\nI won’t allow Gift to harm her a second time.\n「Goodbye. I will live without seeking you again. That’s how I want it to be」\nJust before he completely disappeared like the mist, he ultimately said something to me. Could it have been a parting farewell? The words of a curse? Or maybe, a declaration of love? Whatever it was, it dissolved in the air of the dark, dark basement before it could ever reach me.\nAnd so, leaving the repairs of the barrier to the teachers, I returned to the school one step ahead.\nWhen I headed above ground to where the brightness of the stars rained down, and out of the basement shut in darkness, the first thing my feet did was to carry me to Lycoris’s room. It was already pretty late with it being past stipulated curfew. The corridors of the female dormitory were silent as the grave.\nHowever, it seems like final year students and prefects could set their own time for when they’ll sleep. Could she have already fallen asleep? Lightly, I knocked on the door. And, if she doesn’t answer, I plan to turn back.\n「...Yes, come in」\nAlthough it wasn’t loud, a clear answer came back immediately, so my heart pounded and leapt out.\n「Please... excuse me」\nKnowing the visitor was me, Lycoris’s expression brightened with enthusiasm. That was just like her. Just how much had that cheered me up up to now, I wonder.\n「Lily, how are you?」\n「I should be asking you that, Lycoris. Will you be alright even without sleep? Don’t tell me you’re still...」\n「That’s not it. If anything, I’m not feeling sleepy since I slept a lot at home, 」\n「...then, is it alright if I talk to you?」\n「Of course」\nWith Lycoris happily urging me to go in, I stepped into her room.\nIt was the first time I’ve entered this room. Since there was an unwritten law among the lower year students not to recklessly visit her room too much, students who’ve entered the dormitory head’s room due to some errand, bragged about being able to enter.\nIf those students knew what I was doing right now, I wonder how they’d react. I’m kind of scared, but I’m also kind of looking forward to it a little.\nIt was impressive that Lycoris’s room had a large bookshelf, but aside from that large furniture, the dormitory head’s room was no different from a normal student’s. However, the frame of the wall-mounted mirror had been elaborately decorated like a flower wreathe, and the futon on top of the bed had been delicately embroidered. Moreover, since the room itself had an antique look, it was elegant. ... was what I thought at first.\n「...Lycoris, was this... a present from someone?」\nWhy I ended up asking and going as far as picking it up, was because it was too eye-catching.\n「Yeah, for some reason, I received it from a girl who left school last year. She’s a pretty skilled girl. It’s well-made, right?」\nCertainly, you could say it’s well-made. Even the stitching was thorough, and the final touches were meticulous. But... why was Lycoris given this childish — to put it nicely – lovely patchwork quilt as a present? And... why was Lycoris using it as a pillow case without a doubt of any sort?\nWhile thinking that way, I surveyed the room\nvery\ncarefully, and saw things that probably wasn’t her preference here and there. But, I could say, it was so like her to have a room filled with these things.\nShe was fundamentally big-hearted. Since she was a person who accepted various things, maybe that’s why there were people who were a little quirky flocking to her side.\nWhen I stared intently at Lycoris, she tilted her head slightly at me as if asking『What’s wrong?』. At a glance, her almond eyes and the mole under her eye made her a sensuous beauty. The truth that she was full of openings was hidden under the facade that she was always on guard, if I hadn’t approached her, I wouldn’t have realized her charm.\nI felt as if the weight on my shoulders was lifted.\nI still needed a bit of courage to talk about my past. But, someday, I’d like her to hear it.\nFirst.. right. I had to apologise. For dragging her and her fiance into this, for exposing the school to danger.\nThen, I’ll tell her what happened today. If I say that we ended up sealing Gift, she’ll probably be surprised at that. Although Duke Lilia smiled, saying『I wasn’t very useful, was I』, it was very gentle and filled with good humor, if I said, “he’s just like you”, I wonder what response she’d make?\nAnd then, if I can, I want to talk together with her about the future. Even after this, is it... still alright that I remain by your side?",

      "content": "School Arc – Chapter 22\nIt was the first early afternoon of the break after peace had returned to the school.\nOn the way back to the dorm, I observed the gentle sunlight that was filtering through the slowly swaying trees, in a daze.\nEven though I said peace had returned, I can’t very well say that anything and everything returned instantly to the way it was. It seemed several people, including me, had gone home after getting caught up in the riots inside the school that followed right after Art’s injury. Thus, most had yet to return to school. Even if you try placing the blame on the families, it was only natural to keep their children at home out of worry.\nSince they can’t afford to resume classes in this situation, the school decided to take measures by temporary closing the school starting from tomorrow. In the meantime, the school head and the teachers would probably be going around, visiting the royal capital and the students’ guardians to explain.\nEven though I made a round trip back home, this and that were completely different situations. This time, we were certain to invite Lily to the house, so Shade and Lily will be going home with me, whereas Wolf will be meeting with us mid-way. My birthday was exactly the second day of the holiday, so we’ve arranged to have a private party among us. It looks like it’s going to be a very enjoyable break, so I’m already very excited.\nMy heart was naturally bouncing when I thought of the holidays.\nI could feel the refreshing breeze and the gentle sunlight that was filtered by the trees on my skin.\nWhile resigning myself to the coming peace, I inadvertently thought about the 『actual game』.\n（The game’s time axis should be almost nearing its end）\nWhat bore fruit from the path the heroine, Lily, pursued, was the route for the hidden chara– for Gift. Given that Lily didn’t choose Gift in the end, she never reached the true ending. In other words, she approached an end that could probably be considered a “bad ending”.\nAlthough it’s called a bad ending, it was the happiest ending for me, given that no one was killed in this timeline.\nOf course, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the credits will roll, so I don’t know what will clearly happen. The possibility that Lily will open another route and fall in love with someone else after this wasn’t entirely zero.\nBut, I think the game events, as far as what I know, should no longer happen, at least. If she falls in love based on developments I know, it wouldn’t be consistent, unless whatever event has already happened. I was sure of that now.\nIt was this noon when Lily came to give me 『certain information』 .\nWe were having a meal together out in the open, not caring about what anyone thought, ever since I took a ‘so what’ attitude on this. Wolf and Shade typically sit with us too, but it seems they’ve been busy since this morning.\nRight now, the male dormitory was in the middle of a large-scale event called spring cleaning.\nPerformed only once a year in the female dormitory, room checks were done 4-5 times a year in the male dormitory, simply because of the occasional disturbances due to the dirty rooms that happen. I hear that the problem with the dirty rooms that gave rise to quarrels coincided with the recent disturbance of Gift’s 『curse』, so now that everything has returned to normal, it seems it was an opportunity to make at least the students who were presently at school clean together. Even the male students will become desperate when they’re told that the holidays will be put off if they don’t finish cleaning.\nIn any case, after we exchange smiles that said「boys will be boys」and finished our lunch, Lily confided to me in secret.\n「Lycoris, to tell you the truth, it seems I can use other magic aside from healing」\n「Eh? Really?」\nI thought that was splendid news, but Lily nodded with a slightly complicated look.\n「There are still a lot of students who are scared of how strong my magical abilities are, so even the teachers told me to lie low for now...」\nThat was probably a wise decision. The school had given the explanation that someone else was the culprit for the recent affairs, but in spite of this, there were still those among the students who were frightened of Lily. There was likely no rationale for this sort of thing. We can only make them gradually understand through time.\n「But, I’ll definitely use it to protect someone — to protect the people I cherish. If I continue to do so, I’m sure there will be more people who’ll accept me, and my powers」\nMoved by that incredibly brave decision, I pulled her into a tight embrace.\nWell, I felt touched at that time, so it didn’t even occur to me.\nOr perhaps I should say, there was a big problem.\nI’m sure that Lily was a genius in magic. She ended up making rapid progress and awakened something like offensive magic in a day. It would be different if that were all, but how far her magic potential will reach was still unknown.\nWhen a yandere appears wielding a knife, it looks like the heroine will have a weapon with a far greater fire power, so to speak.\nOr, if the yandere plays dirty, it looks like the heroine will end up easily seeing through the scheme to abduct and confine her.\nIt’s like the makings of a peerless heroine.\n(The yandere game is defeated... But then, what does that mean for the game — or rather, for this world?)\nEven though it was extremely alarming at how slowly I remembered things concerning Gift, now that the game’s time seems to be ending, I think I have probably recalled almost everything about the game.\nI considered other things on top of that. About this world. About the game. And, about the connection between this world and the game.\nSince this world had a lot in common with the game, I thought that this world equaled the game world. If that’s the case, why did this world have parts that were different from the game? A bug? If so, was my existence a massive bug? ...it’s not a very pleasant theory to think about.\nOr, suppose a theory that this wasn’t the game itself but, say, a world created with the game as a model?\nBut, if it had been『created』, shouldn’t there be a『creator』? And, was there a consciousness to that creator? If there was, what does it think about this world deviating slightly from the essence of the game?\n（And if that’s the case, did I overturn the fate set out for me by that creator?）\nThat was a very exaggerated and slightly scary theory to think about.\nBut, since I plan on living every moment as best as I can, I don’t have any regrets.\nWell, in any case, there was no evidence for these theories. It’s my loss if I only worry about theories. But still...\nIt was at that moment when I was about to step into an endless reverie.\nA suspicious figure crossed the tip of my vision.\nWalking with a large package that seemed to be of great importance, was a lanky young boy — Oria.\nI can’t see Ru Xiang’s dignified figure standing near him. As that exotic nobleman’s guard and attendant in school, it was unusual to see Oria walking by himself. Intently holding onto the package wrapped in cloth, he seemed to be scanning his surroundings somewhat nervously.\nIt was suspicious that he was ignoring the paved brick road to walk under the shade of the trees, like he was hiding something. I would’ve thought he was skipping town had I not known that the male dormitory was conducting spring cleaning.\nEven if that wasn’t the case, I felt a sense of distrust towards him. And with the reason being what it was, I couldn’t discuss it with anyone.\nThat is,『because he didn’t exist in the game for some reason』, would be nonsense to anyone else.\nApart from that, Oria was a character worthy of favor. Even though he appeared a little timid to the younger people with a higher social status than him, he wasn’t a bootlicker. Above all, he took the responsibility of being Ru Xiang’s guard seriously.\nAlthough he doesn’t seem like a pretty dependable older man with his lanky build and mild-mannered demeanor, he attracted a certain popularity with women who preferred the gentle kind.\nActually, his gentle features were wasted by the moderately long, reddish-brown bangs that gave off a terribly gloomy impression.\nI pulled myself together and tried to greet him with the friendliest smile I could muster.\n「Hello, Oria」\n「Hii!」\nBut, when my greeting alone was met with a strangled reply, my smile turned stiff.\n「D-Dorm Head Lycoris! I-I’m sorry. I ended up being surprised...」\nOria apologized in a panic and was about to depart hastily with a “well then”. Correcting his tight hold of the carefully covered package, he then twisted his body as if to keep it from my sight.\n「...Wait」\nI think preventing him from leaving was only natural.\nOria came to a stop with a pale expression that seemed as if he’d received the death sentence or something and, in the end, replied:\n「I’m... not... doing anything suspicious...」\nHis remark was as good as a confession. When he’s been acting suspiciously thus far, was there anyone who wouldn’t be suspicious?\n「What is that package? Is it yours? Or, could it be Ru Xiang’s?」\nThe moment I mentioned Ru Xiang’s name, Oria’s shoulders gave a sudden jolt. This person was supposed to be twelve years older than me, but can he really last in society with him being this easy to read?\n‘Now then’, I thought, folding my arms.\nIt would be a different matter if it was Wolf, the dorm head of the male dormitory, but I don’t have the authority to inspect Ru Xiang’s package. Still, it didn’t sit well with me to just let it pass. Which was why, I tried putting him off balance.\n「That package looks heavy. I can give you a hand if you want」\n「N-n-n-nonsense! I was charged to carry this alone, after all!」\n「Oh my. When you say it like that, it kind of makes me curious about the contents 」\n「Eeeeeeeeeeh!?」\nEvery one of Oria’s reaction was loud.\n「I wonder what’s inside?」\n「T-t-t-that is... I’m afraid I can’t say! I-it’s just trash!」\n「But, there’s a place to throw trash away in the male dormitory, isn’t there? I take it it’s something you have to throw away yourself?」\nOria was previously walking to the waste-collection point where the school’s garbage was consolidated. The times when students purposely go there to throw away trash was when it was maybe bulky, or when it was trash they didn’t want anyone knowing about.\n「This is, you see... huge trash, after all」\n「Is that so?」\nI scrutinized the『trash』 wrapped in pitch-black cloth.\nIt was bumpy and protruding strangely under the cloth. I know that whatever it was, was oddly-shaped and solid to some extent. It was wrapped under layer upon layer of cloth, such that I couldn’t discern the object inside.\n「From the shape of it, I’m sure it’s not a kind of book...」\n「Please don’t try to dig into it any furrtherrr」\nOria said it in a pretty miserable voice, then hastily pulled off his own jacket, turned his back on me, and crouched down. He spread his own jacket on top of the lawn and started to wrap the package with it.\nIt was just so desperate that I felt I had to stop, since even I felt like I was somehow bullying the weak.\nIt was at that moment when I took my eyes off of him.\nSomething fell fromOria’s back and out into the open.\nWhat I picked up almost reflexively seemed to be a black leather notebook.\nThe size was as big as a paperback book in modern day Japan.(1) However, it was thick enough that you could even block a sword with it. It seems the contents had been steadily filled in, I could feel the thickness, the more the leaves of the paper bent, bit by bit.\nIt’s been used for a long time, but I could see it was used with great care.\n「Oria, this fell...」\n「UwaAAAAAAAAAA!!!」\nScreaming as if a Doppler effect oscillating, Oria even abandoned the good manners he sort of preserved before then and tried to snatch the notebook from my hands.\nI instinctively avoided it. It’s not like I was planning not to return it to him. It was just that I was surprised and my reflexes were on the better side.\nBefore I could ask him to calm down a little, Oria planted his knees on the ground.\n「Eh?」\n「I’msorryimsorryimsorryimsorry......」\nAlthough he probably didn’t intend to do that, that appearance, where he curled his body as if to cling to my feet, was no doubt a『dogeza』.\n「Y-you’re being scary, so please stop」\n「Pleaseforgivemepleaseforgivemepleaseforgivemepleaseforgiveme......」\n「W-what are you apologizing for?」\n「I didn’t mean anything bad! It was a passing fancy...」\nI wasn’t getting through to him.\n「O-Oria, you were about to end up throwing an important package away, weren’t you?」\nRu Xiang’s package was left on the lawn wrapped in Oria’s jacket. I half-begged him to get up, but Oria gave a mis-match reply.\n「I-I’ll hand this over! So please give it back to me without reading what’s inside」\nOria tore off the package from his own jacket in one stroke, and pleaded with me while making sure to hold the bundle of black cloth reverently with both hands.\n（What a fast change of heart...）\nSo, in other words, he didn’t want his own secret(?) exposed, even at the expense of his master’s secret(?)?\nThough I was bewildered, I was curious about what’s inside the package for now. After exchanging the notebook with the package, I unraveled the tightly fixed knot around the cloth.\nAnd then, I cautiously opened the large, thick cloth, that looked almost like a dark curtain.\nMy breath hitched the moment my eyes met with a white lump that inadvertently made an appearance from there.\n「...!!」\nIt was as if the bright sunlight was receding only around me.\nAs if the freezing breath of midwinter was blowing only at me.\nThat was how I felt at that moment.\nThe thing that appeared from inside the cloth...\nWas a slender, white『arm』that appeared to be a child’s.\n(1) 17×11 cm book",

      "content": "School Arc – Chapter 23\nWhen that『arm』, which had been lopped off around 10cm from the wrist, tumbled down the thick cloth and out of my hands which were frozen in terror, though, it made a hard crashing sound.\n「...i-it’s... a fake?」\n「Yes. That’s right.」\nI tried lightly poking the 『arm』that tumbled down. The cool hard texture was no doubt porcelain. There wasn’t a speck of doubt, that though it had the appearance of white porcelain skin, this was only meant to resemble it.\nI unravelled the baggage further to chase away the question that filled my mind.\nIt’s coming out, it’s coming out. There were a total of six arms in the end. Just like the first arm, the slenderness reminded me of a preadolescent young girl’s.\n「Even I had a problems with it. To think, a man who’s approaching the later half of his teens would have a hobby like doll making」\n「Doll... making...」\n「I even thought he’d stop once he was old enough to enter school! But the art teacher told him something unnecessary like『This is art! You have to keep on making these by all means, I’ll do all I can to cooperate as well』, so the situation got even worse!」\n「I-in other words, this was... by Ru Xiang?」\n「Yes!」\n「As a hobby? Of making dolls?」\n「Yes! My master’s hobbies are fantasizing about the girl he likes in his childhood and making dolls of her. Ah~ It’s awful when he makes me throw away the duds like this, but also, more than that, when Dorm Head Wolfgang and Prefect Shade come to the rooms for business or so, I’m always on pins and needles, fearing the day they’ll wind up seeing the doll room in the adjoining room. I’m sure at least an entire day of my lifespan gets cut down every time– 」\nAs he chattered on while voicing his complaints, Oria’s head suddenly lurched forward. I wondered whether he received a backhand chop from a tsukkomi without me knowing it, but that wasn’t it, the object that assaulted Oria’s head — a shoe which seemed to be a man’s — landed on the lawn with a plop.\n「R-Ru Xiang...」\nEven without the shoe on his other foot, the black-haired beauty still managed to look elegant as he walked towards us.\nHe picked up the shoe on the lawn just as he was, dusted it off with a pit-a-pat, then wore it as if nothing had happened. When he did so, there was no longer anything that messed up his white, foreign-looking attire, and he stood with a regal air.\nNot knowing what expression to show him, I looked down.\nBased on what Oria said just now, in a portion of his room — there was usually one room provided in the dormitory, but it appears he somehow had two rooms to use. Since Ru Xiang clearly receives special treatment even though it was this school we’re talking about, that’s nothing to be surprised about now — Ru Xiang was decorating dolls as a hobby.\nMoreover, Ru Xiang based the dolls on a girl he liked in his childhood.\nAs a person who was once born and raised in Japan, a world power for craftsmen, I have no intention of making fun of him for making dolls simply because he was a man. I do, in fact, consider things like hina dolls as art. However, the doll had a real-life model. Naturally, he most likely hadn’t gotten the other person’s consent.\nIf I had to say whether this was a SAFE or an OUT... I’d say it was probably a SAOT. (1)\nI had known there was a scrupulous side in Ru Xiang, though. My honest impression was, ‘He wound up going in\nthat\ndirection, huh?’. In the game, there hadn’t been any mention of his hobby.\n「Lycoris-sempai...」\nLooking up when my name was called, I saw Ru Xiang’s handsome features warped into a sad expression. It had been a look that, had I been a woman that possessed maternal instincts, would’ve made me unconsciously think, ‘Stop, please don’t make that face’.\n「You ended up hearing it, huh...」\n「Y-yeah. Just a little, uhm...」\nRu Xiang lowered his hazy eyes in sadness. Tears were accumulating in his usually clear, black eyes.\nHis hand, which meekly hesitated as it reached out, covered mine pleadingly. That hand was trembling and a little cold.\n「It’s okay even if you don’t try to understand. But if you could, please don’t hate me...」\n.......Okay.\nWell, it’s not like he plans to cause anyone trouble by concealing it from the person herself. If I compared him to the likes of Art, I probably wouldn’t be wrong even if I end up saying that Ru Xiang was a completely lovable junior.\nWhen I repeatedly nodded my head with that in mind, Ru Xiang’s expression turned radiantly bright. A hint of red evidently flushed on his porcelain cheeks.\n「Thank goodness. I can take this as you will never speak of this to anyone, right? Thank you very much」\n–huh?\nDid he just top it off with a relatively firm demand?\nAlthough something there didn’t sit quite well with me, I didn’t plan to be a source for rumours, so I nodded my head once more.\n「G-good for you, huh! Ru Xiang-sama!」\nAfter watching in suspense as Ru Xiang and I spoke, Oria called out, sounding deeply moved.\nWith that beaming smile, you wouldn’t have believed that he was the servant who’d so readily given up his own master’s secret earlier.\nWithout replying to Oria’s words, Ru Xiang quickly drew close to Oria and wordlessly snatched the notebook from his hands.\n「Ah—-!!」\nOria cried out, but Ru Xiang held out the notebook towards me without paying it any attention.\n「As a reward for your kindness, please kindly accept it. If Senpai feels angry after seeing what’s inside, I don’t mind getting rid of this person for you in whichever way」\nIt appears Ru Xiang had been silently fuming.\nWhile thinking of the two as a 『like-minded pair of master and servant』 in my mind, I gratefully accepted the notebook.\nI was curious as to why handing over the notebook to me turned into a 『reward for my kindness』, but halfway through, I internally decided to『just let it be』.\nI opened it without taking it too seriously, no matter what was written in the notebook, it probably wouldn’t be as shocking as a person’s arm coming out from inside a wrapping.\nThe contents of the notebook were composed in a novel-like form.\nAlthough it needed my concentration to read the tightly fitted words written in fine penmanship, I was quickly drawn to the composition.\nThe reason as to why, was because the story’s main character was named Liliam Valley.\nLiliam– Lily, was admitted to the magical school, met a young man there, and fell in love. The hero’s name was Wolfgang Eisenhut.\nThe contents of the novel had evidently been Wolf’s route in the 『actual game』.\n(1) SAFE or OUT or SAOT\nSAFE means that it’s appropriate material (Sfw); OUT means material that would be immediately deleted if posted (Nsfw), and SAOT is material with dubious content that clearly looks NSFW but are not deleted based on deletion criteria. When researching on the net on this, I ended up seeing a picture of a girl who was nearly naked, save for small pieces of cloth that helped to hide the you-know-what’s.",

      "content": "School Arc – Chapter 24\nI felt as if my head was being physically swung around, but fortunately, the person I could hurl my questions at, was here right now.\n「... Were you the one who wrote this, Oria?」\nOria tried to stubbornly keep silent and avert his eyes from me, but after he’d been persuaded (threatened?) by Ru Xiang who told him to 「answer the question」, Oria hanged his head.\n「Y-yes. That’s right...」\n「This... What on earth–」\nI hesitated, unable to form the words I wanted to ask.\n「Explain, Oria」\n「E-err... in short, it’s a novel. I used people in the academy as the models...」\nIt’s obvious that wasn’t all. There had to be a reason why it has a pretty obvious resemblance to my memories of the 『actual game』 .\n「Oria, do you have memories of a past life?」\n「...eh?」\n「No? Then, what on earth...」\n「I(boku)... No, I(watashi), uhm, actually have a slightly unusual magical aptitude...」\n「Magic? Then, don’t tell me, you can tell people’s『fate』 ?」\n「??」\nWhen Oria sent me a puzzled expression, I stared back with an expression that must’ve been awfully stiff.\n「Fate? No, that kind of magic is...」\n「But, you’re writing the knowledge you acquire through magic here, right?」\n「Y-yes. That’s right」\n「Isn’t this in other words『fate』? There might be various ways to call it, but isn’t this honestly what it should roughly be..?」\n「N-no, an exaggeration like that is...」\n「But...」\nHung up on a thought that came to mind, I must’ve lost my composure. Oria had gotten completely pressured by my intensity that seemed to press him hard for answers. Only after Ru Xiang stepped in, saying「Lycoris-sempai, may I bother you for a moment?」, did I finally realize this.\n「Ah... I’m sorry」\n「I don’t know why Sempai keeps calling the things written here as 『fate』. But at the very least, the contents haven’t materialized right now. I feel it shouldn’t be called『fate』」\nWith Ru Xiang’s well-organized and gentle spoken words, I was able to calm down a little.\n「Erhm, that’s probably, because I– no, uhm, because there’s someone who’s going against fate」\n「But, is fate something that can be gone against? 」\n「............I’m sorry. I got confused」\nIn fact, after I proceeded to read the notebook, my brain got awfully confused.\n「Oria’s magic is seeing 『possibilities』 concerning a person’s life」\n「Possibilities...?」\n「Yes. It’s possible to mostly see the past and, at times, the future, but visions of the past and visions of the future are strictly different. The difference lies in seeing a number of varying possibilities. What Lycoris-sempai read was just one story written in the notebook. Please, try reading the next stories as well」\nUnder Ru Xiang’s prompting, I opened the notebook once more. Written next after Lily and Wolf’s story was... some kind of love story between me and Art. Even though I’d only skimmed through the story, that had been all I could bear to read of that.\n「Eh? What is this」\nA story like this was naturally not in the game. I attempted to go on reading the page after that and, this time, it was a story about my friendship with Lily... or, so I thought, the situation was looking ominous. At a scene where Lily was was going to kiss me, I closed the book and held my head.\n「??????」\nWhat I read was probably no less than a tenth of a page, but it packed quite the punch.\nThe notebook that has now been placed on my hands...\n... was clearly at the top of『strange things』 in my life so far. The notebook’s cover was a leather that could be found anywhere, but the part that hinted that the contents would be so confusing that it’d defy description, was nowhere to be found.\n「Umm....」 , the creator of this chaos raised his voice.\n「I’m sorry. That is... I didn’t mean any harm! Somehow or the other, I felt bad that these poor unpicked possibilities would end up disappearing without a trace, so...!」\nWith his slender arms, Ru Xiang poked the back of the energetically explaining Oria with a thump.\n「I’m sorry, it’s a hobby. It’s my hobby, I can’t get myself stop. The story between Dorm Head Wolfgang and Liliam-san is actually my favorite tragedy... And, the story between Arutad-san and Dorm Head Lycoris with a childish boy and an older onee-sama seemed really nice... As for the story between Dorm Head Lycoris and Liliam-san, how do they put it – a “man’s fantasy”...?」\nOnce Oria was done talking about his excessively broad range of preferences like he’d been in a trance, he spoke with a somewhat faraway look.\n「Since way back, it’s been my hobby to write down the stories that interest me when I see the『possibilities』of the surrounding people. Every time it’s found out, I’d get kicked out no matter how seriously I did my job and had to make work as a stray...」\n「Please learn from your experiences already」\nOria had tears filling the corner of his eyes at my straight up retort, but he hadn’t said “I’ll do that, I’ll stop already”. This was hopeless.\n「To begin with, isn’t this misuse of magic?」\n「It might not seem like it, but he did get some kind of coaching from the association regarding his use of magic」\nRu Xiang wore a wry a smile as he explained that Oria was allowed to use magic that only related to being Ru Xiang’s guard.\nHowever, in Oria’s country of birth — which was a small country, different from Ru Xiang’s — there wasn’t an organization like the association or an institution like this academy. Because of that, it seems Oria had barely any control of his magic and invoking magic pretty often had nothing to do with his own will.\nWith his head hanging low like he was apologizing, Oria’s behavior seemed admirable at first glance, but I couldn’t quite gush forth a tolerant attitude when I consider the notebook’s existence which was sort of the 『embodiment of chaos』.\n「...at any rate, what Oria sees are nothing but things that won’t happen in tandem, so even if they are『possibilities』, it’s impossible for them to be all just one『fate』. Rather, if there had been a magical user who could accurately see the past or future, he wouldn’t be able to live with this much freedom, don’t you agree?」\n‘That’s true’, I thought, while feeling as though the string that I nearly had in my hands was gradually slipping away.\nI’m acquainted with possibilities. I guess it’s like knowing the events regarding a parallel world. Like, had Wolf lost his father in the poisoning incident, or had Shade been raised under the care of Uncle Narcissus, maybe Oria would’ve been able to learn about a world with such an incredibly frightening possibility by now.\nI sort of understood his peculiar magic now. But it didn’t become the key to solving my question 『regarding the relationship of this world and the game』 like I thought it would.\n「...Oria, do words like『Yandere』 or 『PC games』 ring a bell?」\n「? No」\nSince Oria, who shook his head with a care, showed interest, I tried giving a little explanation. The explanation itself regarding computers was difficult, so I put suitable emphasis on what yandere and games were. Explaining 『Flag』,『branches』, or『multi-end』was difficult, but I used so called stories that branches out with choices as examples. (1)\nIt seems Oria had a strong imagination and somehow managed to understand, after hearing my explanation, his eyes gradually brightened up.\n「Incredible! That seems pretty fun! The concept of『branches』 is good! If that’s the case, you can weave a lot of possibilities into one and differ from the usual novels! Even the thing you call 『yandere』 sounds awesome!」\nIt’s wonderful that he seemed happy, but it doesn’t seem like Oria knew about the『actual game』 .\nDisappointed as I was, before me, Oria continued chattering on excitedly.\n「I definitely want to be reborn in a world that has this『game』!! Then with all these possibilities, I’ll incorporate the『yandere』 into the『game』and make–」\nThe unrepentant Oria had been speaking while touting the notebook that he seemed to treasure when Ru Xiang nailed a splendid elbow strike at his servant’s solar plexus.\nAnd then I muttered, overcome with surprise.\n「Re...born...?」\n「Aah, is it not a too common concept in this country? In our country, we have the concept of reincarnation...」\nRu Xiang had kindly given me an explaination, but I knew that even without hearing it. If anything, I was a living testament to that.\nThat’s right.\nThere was reincarnation.\nI can’t claim that I didn’t consider my example when Oria claimed the possibility that he’d be reborn on earth – in Japan.\nIn this regard, what’s to say that Oria won’t be reborn in Japan long before I died? I mean, there’s no guarantee that reincarnation will always follow the time axis. And, will Oria be the one to make the game by relying on his past life’s memories? Will I play it?\nWas the resemblance of the events between the game and this world patterned from the knowledge he obtained with his own magic — in the style of a vision of the past, after all?\nIt’s as if someone whispered ‘That’s correct’, right then. At that exact moment, I recalled the title of the 『actual game』.\nThe game’s title was 『Deja Vu』.\nEven though the word floated in my mind numerous times when I was young, I couldn’t connect it with the game’s title until this very moment.\nDéjà vu. <Kishikan>.\nWhose <Kishikan> was it referring to?\nThe accepted theory among fans was that the game was named after the game system wherein the player must keep playing numerous times to arrive at the happy end.\nIn the game, if, say, the first round had a tragedy that couldn’t be avoided, in the second round, it could be avoided with a newly appearing choice. It was such a system that seemed as through a simple deja vu was coming to save the heroine’s future.\nThe specification was unpopular with the users who preferred seeing only the happy endings, but I rather liked it. When you know the tragic, painful episodes, you’ll be able to enjoy the happy endings more.\nBut the truth was...\n『Deja Vu』 was referring to the famed creator’s deja vu. In other words, his past life’s memories, perhaps?\nThen, were the people in our world the originals and the game characters modelled after us?\nIt’s preposterous.\nThere’s no way to verify it.\nBut, there’s no way to deny it either.\n「...wouldn’t you forget your past life if you’re reborn?」\n「Through will power! I’ll remember!」\nIt’s absurd.\nBut, based from my experience, you can recall past memories when you connect this life’s knowledge with the past’s. In my case, that knowledge had been 『Wolf』. In Oria’s case, what if that’s when I was telling him about 『PC games』, 『flag』, or 『Yandere』 just now?\nAs I sank into silence, Oria seemed to have misunderstood somehow.\n「Uhm, I’m sorry. I went overboard... Err... I hope you won’t misunderstand me, but it’s not like I thought, ‘if reality was like this, it would be great’. I do like the『world of possibilities』that have different facets, but that’s because I can more vividly understand the value of things I have in real life... I can’t explain it properly, but...」\nOria shrank, looking a little insecure.\nI understood a little of what he said. After all, I was happy right now. I had Wolf, Shade, Lily, and Father, and I knew about Mom’s smiling face.\nI could meet Duke Ranunculas whenever I wanted to. I got letters from Crinum and Aunt saying they were doing well, too.\nIt feels vividly clear to me that the value of what I have now was more prevalent when I think of what I didn’t get. It’s like when the game’s happy ending looked lovelier after seeing the bad endings.\nFinally, I could smile at Oria.\nI don’t know the answer. Just what I thought\nmight\nbe the answer. There’s no way to really know for sure.\nBut there was one thing I can do. And that, was to live to the fullest.\n(1) i.e. those ‘Choose your adventure’ books.",

      "content": "School Arc – Epilouge\nLet me tell a little bit about what happened after.\nIt appears the master and servant, Ru Xiang and Oria, who gave me an extra large surprise at the very last moment as a present, will be staying in the royal palace of our country for this break.\nThere’s still a lot of things I want to talk to them about. I’m looking forward to seeing them again back at school.\nArt was temporarily recuperating at home.\nBut what should be surprising was that it seems he left a letter of apology to Lily before heading home. The thing that had been shown to me was, sure enough, Art’s handwriting. The content of which was about how he was giving a lot of thought about the current incident in his own way.\nBut then, this was how the last sentence on the letter went.\n『Be sure to tell Lycoris that I’m reflecting really hard on it』\nIt would’ve been splendid had that not been there. But then when I think about Art up until this point, even if I can see only a tiny little speck of it, sending over the letter was already clearly progress.\nHitting Art with my fist as punishment may work rather well.\nLily will be indulging me by staying the entire part of this break at my home.\nWe’ll cook meals, learn horse-riding, and go to Wolf’s place to have fun together. Since our schedule was jam-packed, not even a single day will go to waste.\nIt seems Shade will be discussing many things about his future prospects with Father after returning home.\nTo be specific, whether or not Shade will be succeeding the position as Duke of Lilia.\nGiven that Father had already gone through pretty much all the necessary arrangements so Shade can choose either option, the rest was all up to Shade.\nIt might just be the older sister in me speaking, but I think Shade would be able to fulfill the duties of being the duke.\nWolf received a loving sermon from Duke Ranunculas immediately after returning home.\nWe couldn’t rely on him during the incident with Gift, but I suspect it must have been painful for Duke Ranunculas. Such was the thing called parental love.\nWolf reported this to me in embarrassment so I think this sermon had shortened the distance between parent and child.\nOnce I finished getting dressed up, I kissed the picture of my mother which I placed on my bedside and stood up.\nDeciding to kill time by wandering a bit, I dismissed my wet nurse and departed from my room.\nToday’s my birthday.\nSince it was a sudden return to home, the party was modest. The participants were Lily, Shade, Father, and Wolf. Duke Ranunculas will be gracing us with his presence for a short moment as well. And my birthday gift from Crinum and Aunt had arrived this morning. The other presents from relatives and academy’s students have arrived as well, but I intend to keep the pleasure of opening them up for later.\nRight now, Shade, the party planner, ordered me to be on standby.\nBy chance, my feet led me to the direction of the library.\nIt was a place I spent a very long time in when I was young. Since it was a deeply intimate place for me, I wind up going there whenever I had the time to spare. Though, after entering the academy, I seldom had the time to visit the place, so the furniture and the like seemed considerably smaller than I remembered.\nThe top-most bookshelf that I used to never reach even when I stepped on a stool.\nThe ladder that I was banned from using because it was dangerous when I was young.\nThe gigantic dictionary that I’d had a tough time turning the pages of.\nNow that I think about it, the me back then who furrowed her brows as she proceeded to read an obscure book with a desperate look, surrounded in this unique dusty odour, must’ve been a pretty lonely kid.\n「Lycoris? Are you there?」\nHearing Father’s voice from out the corridor, I rushed out of the library.\n「I’m here, Father」\nCatching sight of my appearance, Father’s eyes grew wide with surprise.\n「Lycoris! ....you look absolutely adorable, my princess!」\nFather’s sweet words eradicated the insecurity I had at wearing a dress that was different from usual.\n「Rather, you’re more beautiful than adorable. You look stunning」\n「Just like Mother?」\n「Yes, that’s right」\nI placed a long gloved hand, that was closer to white than pink, on my father’s arm as he wore a very tender smile on his face.\nMy attire today was a soft-lined dress with an antique pink theme. The colors matched well with each other, but for me, who’d worn nothing but black and rouge dresses, it was a huge venture. Since it wasn’t a formal occasion, my hair wasn’t tied up and was flowing down the sides of my face and completed with a fresh flower ornament Lily had handmade for me.\nLast night, feeling as if only rouge dresses looked good on me, I boldly decided to try wearing a dress that had simply turned into a decoration for my closet after being tailored with a fabric that I fell in love with. Making use of the flowers in the courtyard,Lily made a hair ornament to go with it by herself, and pinned it to the back of my flustered head.\nI headed to the hall escorted by Father.\nOnce we opened the door, the colorful lights and petals rained down on me. It was due to magic that these disappeared before hitting the ground, right after completing their task.\nRight after, everyone’s gaze fixed on me.\nShade, who had been nearby, widened his eyes, indicating surprise. Then, he showed praise by making a high-pitched whistle. It was rude, but it’s an informal gathering, so I won’t scold my younger brother.\nWith a smile of an accomplice, Lily exchanged glances with me, her hair adorned with a green rose — of course, matching mine– like our own secret sign.\nDuke Ranunculas gave me words of praise and placed a gentle kiss on my hand as a greeting. With his grey moustache at the back of my hand, I felt ticklish, abashed, and of course, very happy.\nAnd Wolf.\nIf I wasn’t full of myself, then somehow, his eyes looked like it was smiling radiantly. He respectfully took over the role of escorting me from Father from then on.\nSince Wolf just kept staring at me without opening his mouth, I flusteredly started the conversation myself.\n「I’m actually aiming to be a lovely lady」\nWolf’s blue-violet eyes smiled as he gave a soft, rare laugh.\n「To my knowledge, I have yet to know a woman lovelier than you」\nSince he said it so happily, the first thought that came to me, rather than getting flustered, was 『I’m so lucky』.\nEven without looking in the mirror, I knew. That right now, I wore a smile that the game’s Lycoris Radiata would’ve never had on.\nThe time of the game was ending, after this, was a world whose future was unknown to me.\nLet’s work hard to earn more friends.\nI won’t give up on Art’s training.\nI’ll study to the max and have fun to the fullest for the remainder of my school life.\nI’ll have to think firmly about my future. For instance, I found teaching Lily a lot of things worthwhile and very enjoyable. It might be hard to become a school teacher, but maybe I could do something like volunteer.\nAnd after that, I’ll do my best at household training.\nI’ll cook tastier meals than Wolf’s and impress Father and Shade as a start. It’s plain to see that Lily was very good with her hands so I’ll do whatever it takes for her to teach me handicrafts.\nI should also be able to lend a hand in mediating a more intimate father-son conversation between Wolf and Duke Ranunculas.\nI feel unease towards the uncertain future.\nBut by filling my heart further with hope, I’ll walk on.",

      "content": "Character Tidbits & Afterwords\nI got the ideas for the names of the main character of this story from poisonous plants.\nLYCORIS RADIATA\nBoth her given name and surname is the technical name of cluster amaryllis. I hear 「Lycoris」 is also the name of a Greek mythology sea goddess.\nThough the other names for cluster amaryllis like corpse flower, hell flower, ghost flower, razor flower are pretty wretched, I think it’s an incredibly beautiful flower. There are a lot of different colors for it, but I like the red amaryllis by far.\nBy the way, in flower language it means things like 「enthusiasm, independence, reunion, resignation, and “only thinking of you”」. It sort of fits her but it also sort of doesn’t.\nFor her outward appearance, she has a mole under her eye, but may I know whether everyone remembers it? Depicting the appearance of the main character using first-person style is difficult, isn’t it? I was supposed to be writing her with the assumption that she’s a relatively glamorous beauty, but it didn’t turn out the way I planned.\nWOLFGANG EISENHUT\nEisenhut is about wolfsbane.* Wolf’s bluish-purple eyes come from this color.\nWolfsbane seems to be also called 「stepmother’s poison」. In ancient times, this is often used to kill the husband’s children from previous marriages in Rome or something like that. Scary. The episode, in which poison was served by the (aspiring) stepmother, came from there.\nA yandere. But, at a level widely received, if at all possible, as the hero. I say, my trouble was that he’d been a difficult character. And truthfully, I think this person comes to help Lycoris way too much at the best timing (LOL), he probably always pays attention to everyone around Lycoris, huh?\nSHADE\nBelladona’s English name originated from 「deadly nightshade」. The name itself has a meaning of「shadow」.\nAlthough a ripe belladona’s content contains poison, it is said to be sweet. This is how the concept of the character of a man who does this and that after inviting girls with sweet words, came to be. He’s a womanizer, you know? May I know whether everyone remembers this setting? (Second time asking this)\nMidway, I had an inkling that Shade faded away to simply becoming a siscon, but, his character was received quite favorably. He’d been very easy for me to write.\nLILIAM VALLEY\nNickname: Lily\nI wonder how many times I made the mistake because I questionably interchanged her name with Lycoris. Thank you very muchhh for all those who pointed out the mistakes. Though I remember feeling the burn of shame as I continued to make the same mistakes without learning from experience... Even though I’ve reread it, I still never notice that trap. The characters’ names didn’t resemble each other at all, I learned.\nThe “Lilium” in Lily’s name is about Yuri(2), but Lily of the Valley = Valley of Yuris = “Suzuran”(3) is her image. Speaking of which, the lily of the valley is an incredible cute flower, but its poison packs a strong wallop.\nActually, I initially planned Lily to shake off Lycoris’s hands until they were at the basement where Gift was— that is to say, until the last moment. Lily’s character was only supposed to change a little when Lycoris started to investigate Lily and Gift further, but in the end, her personality settled down to this.\nIt seems she became actively stronger at the end of this volume.\nARUTADO BRUGMANSIA\nNickname: Art\nBrugmansia came from the scientific name of angel’s trumpet. Arutad is Datura read in reverse. The meaning of Angel Trumpet in flower language are things like 「charming and deceitful charm」.\nHe might be a natural character to hate, but he’s rather fun to write.\nSince he’s a character in the game, there’s also a route where Art and Lily fell in love. Which means there’s a happy ending with him that’s not yandere.\nSeriously worried about it, I thought 「 it would be a blessing (at least for Lily) if he’s tamed by brainwashing him with hypnosis. As expected, it felt cruel, so I didn’t allude to it in the story.\nRU XIANG\nHis name is the Chinese name for Daphne.\nSorry for those who hoped he’d be a serious yandere. He had been a questionable gag member.\nIf Art’s concept was a 「harmful idiot」, then Ru Xiang’s concept was a 「harmless pervert」. He’s not completelyharmless, right? I wonder if he violated someone’s portrait rights. Since Lycoris was in no mood to worry about it, she didn’t butt in to who he used as the model for his dolls.\nI was told by my sister, ‘Because of Oria, he got pushed to the background, didn’t he?’. (LOL) Certainly... he would’ve had more impact if he showed up alone. I also feel that I wanted to portray him with a rather hard personality a bit more.\nORIA\nOnly this character had a name with no relation to a plant or a poison. He was added on the spot.\nHe’s a living punch-line that’s related to the story’s overall mystery(?). Honestly, what did you think about the punch-line? Something like, ‘he’s difficult to understand!’, or, ‘what’s up with this punch-line!’, if you give me your opinions, I’ll sincerely accept.\nIn short, Oria reincarnated into modern day Japan and made the Yandere otome game, fully integrating his interests, using Lily as the protagonist... for all we know, maybe? In that case, he would’ve used Wolf’s lines「I’d rather kill you now」 that he learned in his past visions as the catch phrase. Maybe Lycoris-san should’ve been more angry at him.\nBut, if Lycoris got angry and Oria gave up making the game, the future (or is it the past?) would end up changing.... Ahh, so bothersome.\nGIFT\nHis name means 「poison」in German. In English, it means 「innate talent」.\nTruthfully, his guard, Mr. Hemlock was a descendent of his sister who married into a distant family... well, there was that setting, but since it didn’t appear in the work, it’s the same as not happening at all, right? Yup.\nExtra:\nUNCLE NARCISSUS RANGURUSTE\nNarcissus is read as “Nárkissos” in English. (4)\nIt’s about daffodils, but I have to make it known that it means「narcissism」 more than anything.\n—\nOne way or the other, I was able to complete the story. Without a doubt, it’s all thanks to everyone who read the story and occasionally provided their opinions and reviews. Every time I updated the story, I would think,「Is this good enough to publicize to other people?」and feel self-conscious, but I’m actually glad that I made up my mind to post it now.\nThese sites, 『Let’s be a novelist(小説家になろう)』『Read novels(小説を読もう)』are very wonderful, aren’t they? Maybe it’s because I see everyone’s reactions. It’s been an emotional rollercoaster, but I think I finished this story without losing interest thanks to that.\nI plan to gradually write extra volumes after this. I wonder if it would be the easiest to understand if I update with similar pages as the normal volumes? Or, should I create a page to use for the extra volumes without messing the normal ones? I’ll observe and study different ways of doing it.\nI don’t know how many I can live up to, but if you don’t mind, kindly let me know if you have a request like 「this is the kind of extra volumes I want to read」 or something. If you have a character or a scene you like to see, please let me know and I’ll dance from joy at the opposite end of the PC.\nLater.\nTranslator notes:\n(1) Eisenhut is the German word for Wolfsbane. Though the author didn’t state it out here.\n(2) Yuri (百合) = Lilium in Japanese\n(3) Suzuran (スズラン) = Lily of the Valley in Japanese\n(4) Narcissus in the original Japanese katakana was Nashisasu. I’ve been reading it like that too. >.<",

So if you want to avoid them, please do not read the section under Stage Ghost Capriccio until they show up.\nFormal Character Introduction\nFor people who’ve forgotten the characters’ names.\nI’ve sort of included the characters that have names one after another regardless of whether or not they’ll appear henceforth. There is a great deal of spoilers ahead.\nLycoris Radiata\nThe heroine of the story. She’d been Japanese in her previous life and had reincarnated into a fantasy world where magic exists. She holds memories of her past life .\nHer magical forte is memory enhancement.\nWolfgang Eisenhut\nLycoris’s fiance.

But she is a strong all-rounder even in offense.\nArutad Brugmansia (Art)\nA person with blonde hair.\nHis magical forte... well, it would be nice if he’d had an art, wouldn’t it? No pun intended. (1)\nRu Xiang\nA person clothed in white.\nHis magical forte is something I plan on writing in due time.\nOria\nA person who is Ru Xiang’s escort.\nThe person who’d make the yandere otome game if he’d been reborn.\nKaffir Radiata\nLycoris’s father. The duke of Lilia.\nPrime Minister-sama\nWolfgang’s father. The duke of Ranunculas and the kingdom’s prime minister.\nIt first came out in the book, but his name is Berus.\nThe origin of his name comes German reading of Cerberus,『Zerberus』, which was deeply associated with aconite.\nSolana Brugmansia\nArt’s elder sister. A mega beauty.\nArt’s siblings are all good-looking.\nViola Atleid\n(2)\nA female student with blonde vertical rolls. The same year as Lycoris.\nThe origin of her name comes from violette (Viola). She is a beauty with violet eyes.\nCharacters that appeared in the『Fiance arc』\nRobinia\nA person that attempted to poison Wolf.\nCharacters that appeared in the『Family arc』\nNarcissus Ranguruste\nLycoris’s uncle and Kaffir’s brother in law.

She doesn’t have enough ability.\nElius Clark\nA playwright.\nClark came from 『Crocus』. It means a lot of things in flower language, but his character is especially close to the image 「love again」.\nIt was pretty cheeky how he succeeded as a playwright by using his broken heart as nourishment.\nIf the characters increase, I’ll continue to insert them here .\n(1) Mhmm, had to force out a pun to show the meaning to this. The not!pun came from the japanese text, which reads:\nTokui mahou wa... aru to ii ne.\n(His magical forte... it would good if he had one (a magical forte))\nWhere “aru to” seems like a play of his name, Art.\n(2) Tried to research about the flower and I found many that reference the first two meanings of the flower but not the last.

      "content": "Extra SS『I saw a dream where I turned into a cat』\nI’d woken up from a short nap and turned into a cat.\nWhen I felt the sunlight on my cheeks, I’d flusteredly cried out,「Haa-! I’ll get scolded by Nanny if I get a sunburn!」 and jumped to my feet. As I did so, what caught my eyes were, what I should’ve earlier been sleeping on, my arms.\nNo matter how I look at it, it was now that of a small black cat’s.\n『Ha?』\nThe surprised voice that emitted from my mouth came out as a delicate cat-like cry.\nI was simply baffled. And while I was like that, a voice called out.\n「...What’s wrong?」\nI felt relief almost reflexively when I heard the familiar voice from somewhere nearby.\nWhatever the situation was, as long as Wolf was there, it would be fine. It seems my head had decided that of its own accord.\n『Well, right now, you see』\nWhat came out of my mouth as I tried vigorously to tell him the situation were things like「fu-nya」 or 「i-nyaa」.\nIt’s no good... this isn’t fine at all.\nWhat the heck? What the heck? , I asked, befuddled, while Wolf’s hands gently stroked my head...wait! Large! His hands were large enough that it could easily grab hold of my skull! Scaryy!\nPanicking, I placed distance from the gigantic hand, and what I saw over there was certainly Wolf’s form.\nWolf? Or should I say, Wolf (L)...?\nFor now, I placed some distance from Wolf(L) and tried to grasp the situation.\nMotionlessly, I looked at my hands.\nIt was the hands of a cat.\nI was a black cat. Even my paws, though sort of pink, were faintly black.\nWith these hands, I couldn’t even pinch my cheeks.\nI looked relentlessly at my surroundings .\nAs it stands, I was in a familiar room. I’m at Wolf’s private room at the Duke Ranunculas residence.\nGiven that I’d been in my home — my own room at the Duke Lilia residence, when I had my afternoon nap, I really have no idea how I ended up intruding into their home, let alone into Wolf’s private room.\nI give up, I don’t know why or how it happened at all. For now, if I had to verbalize the present situation, then, for some reason, I, Lycoris Radiata, was in the form of a cat and in my fiance’s, Wolfgang Eisenhut’s, room. Atop an elegant desk.\n（What does this mean, what does th- ah, could I have just imagined waking up? Am I still in a dream?）\nWith the possibility that came to mind, I felt the sense of crisis sweep away from my brain.\n（...eh? What’s with this oversimplified way of thinking）\nI think I’m normally someone who thinks a little more about things. Yet, simply thinking right now feels like a hassle. Was it because I’m a cat?\nMy rational side was probably trying hard to grasp the situation. But my instincts that got eroded by my feline side were telling me,『Oh well~ isn’t this fine?~ it’s just a dream anyway~~』, and had wanted to yield to that half-hearted conclusion... I don’t suppose I’m going to plunge to a level where my instincts will eventually end up winning over my rational side = a level where even my thoughts will turn into a cat or something, right?\nWhen I was losing my wits, I turned to my dependable fiance, Wolf, to ask what I should do and–\nHe’d long taken his eyes off me and was penning down official documents on the table.\nWell, I don’t think that was unreasonable.\nI mean, who in the world could’ve imagined that before he knew it, the cat right in front of him would turn out to be his fiance?\nRather, a Wolf who ended up filling his mind with such fantasies was someone I’d ha.... actually, I guess I wouldn’t particularly hate that. If Wolf was thinking such a thing under that serious expression of his, it wouldn’t be what I’d expect, but it would be cute.\nIn any case, I have no intention of criticizing Wolf. In terms of my rational side, that is.\nBut my body was honest.\nBefore I knew it, the black cat that was me had pretty much taken spot on top of the documents that Wolf was engrossed with.\nHow should I put this? The me right now couldn’t forgive Wolf for ignoring me and working on the documents.\nThese documents don’t happen to be important, right? Sorry Wolf, don’t get angry, ok? Even as I thought these, my black tail shamelessly hit Wolf’s arm. Since I had fur, it felt more like a 『fwapp』 than a 『whack』, though.\nI heard laughter from above. Fortunately, Wolf wasn’t angr—.\n「... what a naughty child」\nWhat did he say?\n‘...What a naughty child’?\nNaughty child?\nNotti chaildo?\nNot-ti chail-do?\nJust now, with that gentle and sweet voice, Wolfgang Eisenhut said that!\nWhat’s this, so thrilling!\nEven though I was a little surprised, his gentle wry smile, along with his scolding of 『naughty child』 was very thrilling !\nMy ears... my ears are melting...\nEh? Don’t tell me, would Wolf scold his child this way if he causes mischief? So jealous! I’m so jealous of Wolf’s child!\n『One more time! One more time!』\nSomehow putting a little strength on my hind legs to stand up, I desperately pressed both forepaws trying to clap as I matched with calls of 『one more time』 ... rather, that was what the calls were supposed to be, but of course, words like that did not come out.\nIt didn’t get through to him, though. Furthermore, Wolf’s finger stroked me under the chin. It did feel good, though. I wasn’t expecting it, but I felt bliss despite the whole ‘turning into a cat’ thing...\nLike this, I let go of my relatively simple rationality–\nWhen I felt the sunlight on my cheeks, I’d flusteredly cried out,「Haa-! I’ll get scolded by Nanny if I get a sunburn!」 and jumped to my feet. As I did so, what caught my eyes were my own familiar arms. I seem to have dozed off near the window of my room.\nIt feels like I saw some sort of fun dream, but I can’t really remember what it was about.\nFor some reason, I had a strong urge to think,「I really want to see Wolf」 . It was that sort of peaceful afternoon.\nAuthor’s Notes:\nAn “it was all a dream” story. It’s almost like saying Lycoris’s excitement was 「burning up」 but it’s probably the author who’s actually burning up with excitement.\nIt’s been a while. I’m starting off with this kind of one-shot but I’m glad that I could deliver the extra arc.\nAfterwards, I plan to upload the extra arcs in regular order, but given the publication commemoration, which is almost like the『preliminary』, please excuse me as I’ll probably update irregularly for around 1 – 2 weeks.\nBy the way, the images below are『what would happen if she encountered other characters as a cat』.\nShade → Lycoris would be an elder sister who’d keep playing until she drops with her younger brother, who’s bad at handling small weak animals. 「What a pesky little animal... Well, I wonder if that person will be pleased?」→ Taking her away by the nape of the neck.\nFather → an expert in all the ways of carrying and stroking. With a sweet voice, she’d get praised highly for being lovely.\nPrime Minister-sama → he isn’t remarkable in the ways of carrying or stroking, but the cat (Lycoris) would have a huge grin when she’s with him. If he tried to leave, she’d have a downhearted look that seemed to say,「you’re going already...?」. Overloading him with cuteness.\nArt → The moment Lycoris sees his figure, she’d run away with all her might.\nRu Xiang → He’d be eager to pet an animal. If he ever timidly tried to approach her, Lycoris would wait for him.\nLily →「Wow, how cute. It looks just like Lycoris」, or something. She’s very sharp. Lycoris’s form actually changed through magic... if a situation like that ever happened, Lily would be the most dependable.",

      "content": "Extra arc 『The Stage Ghost’s Cappricio』 Prologue\nWhen you talk about a kiss...\nI wonder what in the world would be the right timing for it?\nThe mummy of the demon king that had slept in the guest house’s basement... Or rather, the incident caused by Gift that stirred the school had settled and passed in an instant.\nAfter nearly all the students had returned right after its temporary closure, the school regained its former bustle.\nUnder the name of His Royal Majesty, the king, there had been a strong motivation that a『safety examination at the magical academy』be conducted.\nAlthough Gift was still in the school’s basement, I heard the barrier became sturdier than ever. This incident may have been because of an irregular existence named Lily, but even so, I’d like to hope there will never be a second time. If security was guaranteed under His Majesty’s name, then by result, the officials must be in a frenzy to prevent another occurrence of the incident. All the best.\nTruth be told, there was also a reason as to why the students had no choice but to return to this school.\nIt’s a somewhat tough topic to discuss, though. To begin with, in our country, there was no such system to train magic users outside the academy.\nThere was a certain level of facilities and experience required to safely instruct the control of magic to cater for each of their individual characteristics. Even though there were also things like private schools or home tutors, it can’t replace this school overnight.\nAs soon as we’re able to graduate from this royal magic academy, we, the magic users, can go out to society with the backing of the magic association. On the other hand, if we aren’t able to graduate, our magic will be resealed, and what we’ve learned so far will have all gone to waste.\nApart from that school circumstance, it got me thinking about the me right now.\nIt was because it became peaceful, because I had time to spare, that I ended up thinking about it.\nAbout when the incident with Gift’s black mist occurred.\nAbout the fact that my relationship with Wolf progressed a bit.\nIn his room where the nightmares had consumed him, I had done something akin to a confession. At any rate, since he’d been inside a dream at that time, the intention that it was a『confession』 was rather flimsy. But I felt that I certainly liked him, so that’s what I said.\nWolf should’ve accepted that.\nIf Wolf, who seemed to have been shifting back and forth between dreams and reality, thought it was just part of his dream... I would’ve been at a loss. But, I was very thankful since Wolf clearly remembered what happened then. I confirmed with him. I was so embarrassed.\nAt any rate, we were no longer just engagement partners that were decided on by our parents.\nI think it would be fine to call us lovers.\nLovers.\nWolf was... my... lover.\n— whenever I think about it, I feel like rolling around in my bed.\nMy thoughts strayed with things like 『Won’t it be alright to change how we call each other because we became lovers!?』 and became troubled about it.\n『Darling』 and 『honey』 are what’s been used in western films. But 『my dear』 ,『sweetheart』, or 『sugar』sounds nice too.\nIt’s not like I yearned to be called that way in my previous existence. If someone called out to me that way... for starters, I’d probably be surprised. That much I was aware of.\nBut if that someone was Wolf, I can at least accept getting called by those endearments for just a short trial run.\nYep. I can, I can.\nIf he whispered them to me with that wonderful, tender~ly sweet voice that had lowered after going through puberty... I’d want to record it and preserve that for all eternity.\nIt’s embarrassing. But I still want to try it even if it’s a little embarrassing. I mean, I’m over the moon right now because I got a lover for the first time in my life, but I feel like I won’t be able to do it once the novelty of it fades. If that’s the case, wasn’t this the first and ultimate chance to call each other 『darling & honey』?\nDidn’t they say that the God of Chance only has bangs? Even if you try seizing him by the back on his hair, there isn’t anything to seize there. You have to guess the right timing, take the plunge, and grab hold of his bangs! (1)\nI’m not going to try and make Wolf pronounce 『darling』 or 『honey』 or anything. Even if I was floating over the moon right now, I was aware enough to know that Wolf doesn’t understand English.\nIt’s fine if I could get him to say a word similar to that in this world. I’m sure, the kind Wolf would willingly consent to my request.\nA similar word to darling. I’ve read enough books to be able to boast about it, so it would be good if I could pull at least this much from that memory.\nA similar word to darling.\nA similar word...\n..................。\n(Hm?)\nThere was no word similar to this that came to mind. I mean, there were definitely romance novels in this world, but...\nDon’t get me wrong, there were special words used to call a loved one in several literatures. Words that likened them to a flower or compared them to gems.\nBut, there was generally no word that lovers use to call each other this way.\n(L-language barrier...)\nWhile it’s regrettable, it seems there was no word that could take the place of ‘darling & honey’ in this world.\nA word that will replace it when I force it to, would be the normal way of saying it, such as 『loved one』 or 『precious person』. But if possible, I’d prefer a foreign word, since I feel like it’ll make it less embarrassing for me.\nI feel that requesting with a 『Try saying ‘darling’』 and requesting with a 『try saying I’m your loved one』were completely different things.\nAlthough the former was 『pleading』, the latter was, how should I put it... too serious? Wouldn’t it be pretty much a『forced confession』?\nAt the end of my agony...\nI let the chance of using ‘honey & darling’ pass.\nCome to think of it, God of Chance, that sure is a tremendously bold hairdo. If it’s for that, I’ll probably be able to let that refreshingly manly retreating figure pass by in the same way too. Goodbye, God of Chance. You might want to warm the back of your head at least, so you don’t get a cold.\nThen, I chose the next agenda for the meeting in my brain.\nAn agenda that I wanted to think about precisely because we became a couple. Aside from pet names. It would be something like hoping to progress as lovers.\nFor instance. A first kiss.\nOkay, this is it.\nNo matter where or when we were, from modern Japan to the parallel world, it was an agenda that was widely regarded as important.\nLanguage barriers or something had nothing to do with it.\nPersonally, getting him to hug me tight or getting him to pat me on the head would make my heart throb more than a kiss. But, a kiss was important as well. A first kiss, especially, can only be done once in a lifetime.\nI might as well ask the favour in an important situation like this. Please make the kiss feel bittersweet so that it will remain as the happiest memory in my life!\nWhat’s important was probably the setting. One with a romantic feeling. Yes, for instance, under a star-filled night sky.\n...Well, it’s not like outside was particularly special. I wouldn’t mind at all if we were alone in a room or something. In that case, the lighting would be slightly faded and dimmed. The sort where you wouldn’t be able to see the other person’s expression unless you drew close...\nThe next was a mood raiser. If I take movies or dramas as examples, an occasion where the pair who fell in love overcame a crisis. Or that instant where they were about to tell each other their feelings.\n....................................。\n....................................。\nHuh?\nI feel like that sort of thing has already happened recently.\nOr rather, wasn’t that exactly the situation when I confessed?\nI had a lot of things going on so I wasn’t able to realize it, but maybe the invisible 『This here is the chance for my first kiss!』 gauge was gradually going up at that time.\nN-no way...\nBut, at that time, it did sort of had the perfect mood for it. The thinly shirted Wolf was sexy. And we were alone in a dimly lit room too. ...the fact that Wolf wasn’t in a good condition was a fly in the ointment, though.\nWhen Wolf came closer to bury his face on my neck, I ended up raising my voice in surprise. But, I was surprised because it had been my neck. If it were my lips or something, I wouldn’t have been surprised... probably?\nMost likely, having read that sort of mood immediately, I would have meekly closed my eyes like a heroine from a teen drama and waited for that moment... I think? I want to believe from the bottom of my heart that even I had that sort of girl power.\nAnd had we gone through with our first kiss at that time... Wouldn’t we have been a more lovey-dovey couple right now?\nDon’t tell me... did I just run away from the perfect opportunity?\n(As I thought, come back, God of Chance!)\nI cried out to the retreating figure with plenty of regrets.\nAuthor’s notes:\nGod of Chance: 「I’ll be back.」\nIn some games not limited to otome games, when you become intimate with a character, you get to change or be able to change the name you call each other.\nI really like games like that.\nThe title and the content doesn’t match at all, but it’s not a posting mistake. The story will start picking up pace in the next chapter. I’d be pleased if you’d follow this story for me.\nTranslator’s Notes:\n(1) God of Luck & Opportunity/Chance (Caerus)",

      "content": "Extra arc 『The Stage Ghost’s Cappricio』 Chapter 1\nI’d been depressed by the God of Chance’s ruthlessness when a letter arrived for me.\nThe one-page letter forwarded from the Duke Lilia residence reached me as I was at school.\nIt was the same routine as always. Even the plain white envelope used for it didn’t change.\nIt hadn’t been sealed with beeswax like when an aristocrat sends a letter. I ripped open the stationary that was simply glued into place. I know this method could open the seal cleaner than using a paper knife.\nWhat came out from inside it was, as expected, a plain white note.\n『To my one and only friend』\nEven the starting line, for the past two years, didn’t once change.\nThe owner of this letter was a lovable and earnest actress of the 『Puppet Opera』.\nThe first time I met her was a night I would never forget.\nShe’d been on the stage, and I’d been in the audience.\nFor me, she was the only starring actress who performed on that wonderful stage that day. But for her, I was one of many spectators. It was an encounter that can’t truly be called one, but I remember that day well.\nAt that time, I was feeling pretty lonely because I wasn’t able to make any female friends at the academy.\nHaving become an associate prefect in my fourth year, I was excited to finally have a good reason to talk with my classmates.\nBut my classmates — perhaps because they were being considerate to me — united against giving me any responsibilities, thanks to that, my workload was really small. Since I had wanted to be depended on as much as possible, it made me feel let down and lonely.\nNo, it’s not like I wanted a problem to happen. But just for a moment, I’d pictured a situation where I ended up giving personal advice or something and kinda made all sorts of mental preparations, that’s all. I did prepare special tea and snacks just in case I got a sudden visitor at my dorm room, though.\nBut in the end, no one asked me for personal advice so I had one-woman tea parties and ate the snacks.... No, let’s not remember that.\nAnyway.\nAs I continued to spend my holidays after becoming an associate prefect in low spirits, I was invited to the theatre by Father. Furthermore, it was the stage of the 『Puppet Opera』 that I had wanted to go to before.\nAmong the various theatres within the royal capital, the royal theatre that had been constructed by the previous king was the best in terms of social standing and popularity. The theatre is visited even by foreign guests, and the stage where they did public performances was superb. Thus, having the popularity that possibly went with it, was the 『Puppet Opera』 . It’s not only the name of the theatre, but also the name of the troupe.\nThere is another official name for the theatre, but no one calls it by that name nowadays.\nThis theatre was famous for being the theatre 『living people cannot appear in』.\nI’m proud to say that I know this theatre’s history enough to compete for the first place among those in my generation. I found it interesting and did my research, after all.\nWay back then, I heard it used to be a pretty ordinary theatre.\nThe driving force for the establishment of the theatre was a noble who had a particular enthusiasm for the performing arts. It had been one huge project of earning many supporters and soliciting a lot of investors with his personal connections.\nThough it was a little far from the heart of the capital, the place was called the best district in town and was spacious enough too. It falls short as a royal theatre in terms of formality, but in its place, it’s granted the freedom to do the theatrical programs as it pleases. Many star actors and singers were born from this place.\nThe incident that occurred has, by now, happened around thirty years in the past.\nBack in those days, there was an actress that had the selling point of being 『a rare jewel that only appears once in a hundred years』 in this theatre.\nJust researching about her, this woman had truly been an incredible person. She was famous not only for her beautiful face, but also for her superb acting and, armed with the world’s best vocal range even among the line of first-rate singers at the time, her ability to flawlessly sing difficult pieces with ease.\nIt was said that with her entry on stage, the status of the 『opera』 — in other words, plays that were expressed partially with lines or entirely by singing — was boosted in this country in one go.\nIt seemed her performance as an actress and even as a singer always earned her immense popularity.\nEven though I heard she’d conducted countless public performances at the royal theatre, she continued to perform at the theatre even until the bitter end. Truly, up to the moment of her death.\nThat woman died on this theatre’s stage.\nIt was said that the incident happened in the middle of practice.\nThe cause of death was officially announced as illness, but it had been the death of the actress who, at the time, swept a generation off its feet. Rumours ranging from suicide, accident, to murder, still persist to this day.\nAnd the problem was after this.\nFollowing her death, a series of strange deaths occurred in this theatre in a very short period of time.\nWhen something unexplainable happens, magic involvement is the first to be suspected in this country.\nSince the place was also the royal capital, it seems that the Association conducted a thorough investigation at that time. The conclusion had been that 『the incident was not caused by magic』.\nBut that didn’t mean the whole thing was settled. Like in modern day Japan where ghost stories don’t die down even while rooted in the belief that everything can be explained with science, this world has ghost stories too.\nIf the Association says so, then it’s not magic. It’s definitely ghosts. That was how the rumours went.\nWhen these kinds of rumours arose, there were people who thought 『what about it?』. In fact, it seemed there were people who tried to dispel the worthless rumour themselves. Mainly, these were the young actors and singers who’d gained experience and acquired fame through this theatre.\nBut the bad luck continued.\nThings like when the lead actress’s health deteriorated and the performance was cancelled, or when the stage curtain was about to open and the lead actor ended up running away completely. Without arranging for extras and the like, there were many scenes where the planning was ruined.\nBy then, rather than a ghost, it felt more like the bad luck was caused by people being afraid of it. Of course, when going onstage for any performing arts, it’s natural that one’s mentality directly leads to failure.\nOnce the custom that people periodically failed on this theatre’s stage and became unable to work as singers formed, those who’d wanted to stick as the lead role here soon disappeared.\nIn the end, even now, after thirty years have passed, many people still believe in the rumour of the ghost that was related to this series of events.\nIn short.\nThere was a ghost in that theatre.\nA lovely jewel who loved the stage and who was loved by the audience.\nThey say that she envied the living, and that she couldn’t forgive them for going up on her stage.\nIt was believed that for a theatre that had no more performers, there would be no way to run as a 『theatre』 , at least.\nBut even while many believed in the rumour, this theatre was still somehow operating and continuing its performances to this day.\nAs a 『Puppet Opera』 that only puppets could appear in.\nThere had been a puppet maker named Nival Galant.\nThe reason why I have to speak in past tense was because he’s already dead.\nThis renowned puppet maker had specialized in self-moving puppets. Moreover, in automatons that moved with magic.\nHe had a lineage that sort of extended from aristocracy, but he didn’t come from a particularly prosperous family.\nWhile studying magic in the magic academy as a young boy, Nival learned about his power. That is to say, the power to move puppets that he made with his own hands at will. His occupation as a puppet maker had probably been quite a natural course of events.\nNival Galant carved trees, polished them, and made puppets by hand. The puppets that had been born through his hands, regardless of the base material, had appearances that would truly be mistaken for nothing but humans.\nA puppet that moves with magic.\nCalling them puppets that didn’t use strings was slightly different from what it actually was.\nIf I were to be asked what Puppet Maker Nival’s magic forte was, then representing it as magic to make robots that had been programmed to move would be much closer to the truth.\nThese puppets created by the hands of Puppet Maker Nival were called 『automatons』, and could sing and dance magnificently in front of people. However, they weren’t singing with their own voices, the puppets had been made to listen to singers’ songs and do something like a record and playback.\nNival Galant made various puppets with that magic, but the reason his name had instantly spread was because of the existence of the 『Puppet Opera』.\nPuppet shows with puppets were originally widely popular in this country.\nThe huge difference between that and Nival’s automatons was, firstly, the size of the puppets. Unlike the stringed puppets, no matter how heavy the automaton was, it could still sustain its own weight and move around. In other words, a life-sized automaton could dance, sing, and move around perfectly like a human on the stage. A puppet opera, not a puppet show. It became a huge boom at the royal capital.\nAt any rate, since they were puppets, they don’t get tired. The can sing and dance without getting influenced by things like physical condition or state of mind. They’ll always perform exactly as practiced.\nOf course, there were many people who criticize this puppet opera and say that the one-off feeling of tension was the true charm of performing arts.\n『The stage is spooky and lifeless』\n『They’re using borrowed songs. This stage has no merits』\nEven among these criticism, the performance with high degrees of difficult songs and movements that were distinctive to the puppets went on, and had, even after the boom had passed, turned into an industrial success.\nIn the ten, twenty years after that, the puppet opera continued to be an industrial enterprise as one of the royal capital’s tourist attractions.\nWhat created the boom that had blown a fresh new air into the theatre and surpassed the puppet opera’s success in its founding days, was the existence of the current greatest prima donna, Miria Galant.\nThe selling point during her debut went like this.\n『Puppet maker Nival Galant’s greatest masterpiece』\n『An automaton that surely had life no doubt breathed into it』\nMiria Galant.\nMy friend and the sender of the letter.\n(1) Nival’s name comes from Galanthus Nivalis",

      "content": "Extra arc 『The Stage Ghost’s Cappricio』 Chapter 2\nHer performance I saw for the first time, had been incredible.\nThe moment Miria appeared on stage, I couldn’t take my eyes off her.\n（She’s like a fairy...）\nShe was a lot smaller than I’d imagine. Her hair which flowed down her back was light brown and her skin looked transparently white. She had been clad in a very pale light blue dress.\nYou’d think that color combination would look dim and end up fusing with the light. But contrary to such sentiment, she stood out on the stage, basking in the harsh light.\nIt was hard to believable even when I saw it right before me that the voice that spilled out came from those small lips and that the volume had emanated came from that petite body. But, it was definitely her voice.\nOther dolls sing by borrowing people’s voices, but Miria’s voice was not borrowed from anyone. I knew it as fact, but it was plain to grasp by seeing it in practice.\nThe automatons’ singing was precise and easy to make out, but they were all pretty much the same. Of course, the voices for the climax part would reverberate loudly. But 『that’s it』, or rather, with the singing following the musical score to the dot, I couldn’t feel the tension even with the orchestra’s performance.\nIn contrast, when Miria Galant sings, it was clear that there was emotion packed in there. The way she applied vibrato, the length of her long tones. Even the conductor’s tension that had to reflect Miria’s 『personality』 was also clearly being transmitted to the audience.\nShe was called a puppet with a heart, but there was certainly a heart in her voice.\nBy the time she finished one phrase of a song, I had already become her fan.\nThe role Miria was playing was a town girl who continued to think of the hero.\nHolding the promise that they exchanged in their childhood in her heart, she waits for her lover who went into the jaws of death.\nBefore long, receiving news of the country’s victory even at the town where the girl waits, oh how wonderful was her song of joy at that time!\nThe girl continued to wait for her lover.\nPeople advised her, 「Your lover has become a hero. He won’t come back to you anymore」, but they could not stop her singing that longed for her lover.\nAlthough the scene changed to the viewpoint of the man who had become the hero midway, I was fidgeting all the way and wished she’d quickly come back.\nI wasn’t the only one who’d thought that. When she appeared in the stage once more, applause that felt like it had been 『unintentional』 burst out from the audience seats.\nEven as we were being intoxicated by her wonderful performance, the stage’s finale was growing closer.\nAnd then, it was the final act. Unable to wait any longer, the town girl ran to where her lover was, and what she saw at last... was the figure of her lover exchanging an intimate kiss with a noble lady from the capital. That day... had been the wedding of the hero who saved the country.\nAs she, who lost her lover in the end, sang a solo filled with overwhelming emotions, the stage closed its curtains.\nThere was nothing worth specially mentioning with regards to the story’s plot. It was a tragic love story that wasn’t that uncommon.\nThe character of the hero, which was the protagonist, was kind of weak, and it was his indecisiveness that made me not quite like him. Well, there was also the fact that I was empathizing with the town girl while watching the play, though.\nI felt disappointed that he ultimately chose the girl who had social status courting him, like he got swept by the flow.\nBut, if I were to say, then I think this performance was a storyline for the sake of painting the earnest love and gallant thoughts of the town girl who Milia was performing as. I’m certain that the plan to show her most charming side had been successful.\nThus, if I were to say something regarding Milia Galant’s acting, then I’d say...\n— it has already surpassed the limits of just acting. The town girl’s love, joy and sadness. It had been the kind of stage where the audience can’t help but have their hearts wrench out when these were seen.\nAfter that performance.\nI spent several days in a dreamlike state.\nI couldn’t snap out it. I’d been musing over Miria Galant’s wonderful voice and her acting even in my dreams.\nSince I was passing time pretty much spacing out, my nanny was worried, and even Shade was perplexed.\nI spent 1-2 days in a daze, using getting my homework done during the holiday as my excuse.\nDuring that time, the only thing I did besides indulging in thought was looking over critiques of past performances that Miria Galant had starred in.\nAttending theatre might nearly be my sole hobby besides reading books.\nHence, our library at home has a large collections of things like books that summarized critiques related to performances at the royal capital.\nThe theatre culture in our country is very prosperous, and books that collect drama criticisms were being published with a certain level of frequency.\nAmong them, I chose a book whose publication was relatively recent and continued reading commentaries regarding plays that Miria Galant performed in.\nThe commentaries related to Miria’s performance were at two complete extremes.\nTo begin with, there were a lot of criticism towards the 『Puppet Opera』 itself. If there were people who claim 『Miria Galant is the sole exception』 among them, then there were also people who lumped her in when criticizing the puppet opera itself.\nDifferent people thought about and perceived her in different ways. Nonetheless, after seeing Miria with these eyes, I wasn’t fully satisfied with the low ratings.\nEven the critic, who I’d used as reference the most when attending theatres so far, gave harsh criticisms to Miria’s performance, I puffed my cheeks in dissatisfaction.\nMy lunchtime had been spent in that manner.\nThen, Father returned home and said this to me:\n「Lycoris. Would you like to go out with me today?」\n「With you, Father? Of course!」\n「Well then. Shall we go meet with the songstress you adore, Lycoris?」\nNaturally, I nodded my head without hesitation.\nShade, who shockingly declined the offer to go with us, stayed at home, so I headed to the capital together with Father.\nAnd so, once Father and I arrived at the Puppet Opera, greeting us, together with a well-built gentleman, was Miria Galant herself!\nShocked by this surprise attack, I wound up staring at her so intensely that it could be rude.\nNow that I see her right in front of me, she really is small. According to her profile, she was around two years older than me. But I was clearly a head taller than her.\nAnd her hair was short. When I think about it, I guess she was wearing a wig during her performances. It was adorable how her light brown hair, which was similar in color to the wig, had a short cut like a young boy’s, a slight curl and looked so fluffy.\nAlthough her eye color hadn’t been clear from a distance, I can now see they were a large, round, hazel brown.\nShe looked very young in general. If I were to describe her based on appearance, then she seemed like a small animal that had to be protected rather than a great actress that should be respected.\n「Welcome, please come in! She’s the young lady, isn’t she? Why, she’s so beautiful」\nThe one who raised his voice loudly was the well-built gentleman standing next to Miria.\nIt seems he was already acquainted with Father, according to the brief introduction Father gave me, he was the manager of the Puppet Opera.\nThe manager, in this case, was the person in charge of the opera who accepts requests from the theatre owner and virtually runs the show.\nFor the royal theatre and the likes, for instance, they place people who contributed to the performing arts development within the country in this position. It didn’t mean the current manager of the Puppet Opera was a prominent figure who had taken part on stage. The implication of being a manager was greater than being an artist.\nFor this Puppet Opera, which had a management decline in the past, a capable person like that was a must.\nPrompted by that manager, the words that Miria earnestly spun with a hoarse voice went like this:\n「I-I’m Miria G-Galant. T-thank you for c-coming all the way h-here」\nAs she made a polite greeting before me with all her might, her fingers were clearly trembling. Her expression was very stiff, and even her eyelashes, that border around her downcast eyes, were weakly quivering.\nI grasped the situation immediately and shuddered.\n（T-the person I admire...! She’s completely frightened of me!）",

      "content": "Extra arc 『The Stage Ghost’s Cappricio』 Chapter 3\nIt’s been a while since I’ve paid attention to it, but... I’m a duke’s daughter.\nEven though we were both dukes’ daughters, it didn’t mean I was bright and sociable or equipped with the same 『gentle princess』 vibe in the likes of Solana Brugmansia-sempai.\nI had black hair and a mole under my eye. If anything, I had an appearance that was on the dark side.\nIn addition, Father and I were invited here as potential patrons of this theatre this time. For that reason, the theatre’s manager, along with a popular actress, came out to greet us.\nWe haven’t decided to support them yet and neither me nor Father have given our family name. Only that we were 『someone related to the 5 duke families』, well it’s not a lie, we only offered our first names and social statuses.\nIn other words, Miria didn’t know my exact rank, but as far as she was concerned, I was a high-ranking noble that looked difficult to approach (or, to be more blunt, I looked a little scary). And as a potential sponsor, I was probably both unnerving and terrifying to her.\nBut, I didn’t want her to have a bad impression of me.\nIf possible, it would be great if we became friend...ly.\nI feel like I have a long road ahead of me though.\n(No), I thought, lifting my spirits.\nSeeing that she was already a famous person at the capital, it was unlikely to have this sort of opportunity for a face-to-face meeting that had nothing to do with my status. This happened because I took advantage of my political influence... Not! I doubt I could’ve even met Miria personally without depending on Father’s connections. That’s why, being treated a little warily by her is inevitable.\n(This is just the beginning, the beginning! If I give up here, then the battle will end before it even begins!)\nI paused to tell her that I was her fan at this very first encounter. But even though she told me 「please feel free to call me Miria」, it clearly feels like she was told to say that by the manager.\nI was not only firmly denied from using polite speech towards her, a girl older than me, but also when I informed her 『I’d like it if you’d call me Lycoris』, she only bowed her head deeply at me. A passive rejection.\nEven though we got to see a few of the dress rehearsals and the like, we quickly departed since it seemed like Miria couldn’t concentrate at practice with us around.\nThus, it opened the doors to me aggressively offering her gifts.\nEveryday, I came to see her performance. Bearing presents.\nIt’s no good to give massive presents right at the start. So I started with bouquets. Then, sweet snacks that were popular at the capital. I checked that Miria took in food just like a human, of course. I also investigated that she liked sweet things. In these sorts of things, she was no different from a human girl.\nIncidentally, the theatre manager’s behaviour was thoroughly polite towards me who continued to frequent this theatre. I don’t know the exact sum, but it’s obvious that Father investing in this theatre for the foreseeable future had something to do with it.\nRegarding my behavior, Shade said this to me as if disgusted.\n『I’m a little skeptical over the wisdom of financially supporting someone you want as your friend』\nHaving been told that, I was at a loss for words. After all, the words that were painful to hear, were incredibly sound that I didn’t know how to refute them.\n『......Th-then help me think of an honest way to be friends with her too, Shade! It’s not like I can just disturb her when she’s so busy practicing... The only thing I could think of was giving support after her performances』\nThere was also the matter of time. I can only visit the capital until school starts, so I don’t have infinite time. During this holiday, by all means, I want to build a relationship with her to the point where 『it’s okay even if I send letters to her』 . That way, I won’t be completely forgotten by her.\nShade answered with a 『don’t ask me』 , looking like he found helping me out both unpleasant and troublesome.\n『If you won’t bother helping me at all, then just leave me be』\nBeing scowled at by me, even Shade seemed to realize how resolved I was.\n『I know you’re serious about this... and even though you’re going about this all wrong, I also know you’re doing your best』\n『Eh? So are you going to help me out?』\nI held on to a little hope. When making friends, I don’t think it’s good to get any further help from Father who was influential. Having said that, it’s also hard to depend on Wolf for this. In times like these, it’s easier to ask favors from siblings.\nEven though he took in my hopeful look, Shade gave me a slightly mean-spirited smile.\n『I’ll help out by not getting in your way』\n『Shouldn’t that be natural?!』\nIn the end, knowing that I was being teased by Shade, I abandoned any naive ideas of relying on my little brother.\nWith that exchange, I renewed the vow that I’d figure something out on my own.\nFirst, I had to get to know the person.\nNaturally, I knew about her achievements as an actress and all the various roles she played thus far. But though I had those sort of topics as a starting line, to begin with, she gets frightened every time I try to talk with her at the moment.\n（First, I have to observe! Find the opening that will close the distance to her heart!）\nLooking at her, I learned something almost immediately. That was... that she shows very few emotions on her face.\nI find it really hard to believe after seeing her perform with an abundance of emotions on the stage, but Miria Galant was near expressionless off the stage. Even though it was clear enough to tell that she was frightened of me in our first encounter, it seems that was an exceptional case, if anything.\nShe doesn’t appear excited or nervous before a performance, and she doesn’t look relieved when it ends either.\nHowever, due to my persistent observation, I had just barely been deciphering the emotions hidden in Miria’s limited facial expressions. Of course, since I don’t have the confidence, I’ve been fumbling, day after day.\nI’ve come to realize that she likes small cute flowers over large showy bouquets. It seems that she likes flowers that are white in color. And it appears she isn’t fond of flowers with overpowering smells.\nSo besides the bouquet I handed to her on stage, I also gave her a basket filled with small flowers at the dressing room.\nIt appears that among the sweets, she had a fondness for baked confectionaries. And it looks like she preferred not the overly sweet taste of artificial seasoning, but the natural sweetness and fragrance of plain simple fruits and nuts.\nIt had been a certain evening that passed while I was continuing to observe her in that manner.\nI visited her dressing room, bringing a small basket of flowers like I’ve been doing these last few days. She earnestly welcomed me without shaking in terror like she had the very first time we met.\nEven though I’m happy that she grew accustomed to me up to this level, our emotional and physical distance was still very far from 『friendly』 . I talked with her near the door without so much as stepping into her dressing room so that I wouldn’t scare her.\nThe development that differed from usual was when she laid eyes on the flower basket I brought.\n「Don’t tell me... are those snowdrops?」\nWhat grabbed her interest seemed to be the small white flowers that occupied a corner of the basket.\nMiria stood up from her chair, still in her stage costume, and charged forward towards me — well, to be exact, towards the flower basket that I was holding.\n「I knew it, these are snowdrops. And there’s so many. You even managed to get them in this season......」\n「Well yes. They may be out of season but there are some stores that handle off-season flowers. Uhm...but since they’re rare, I just found them by chance......」\nActually, I relied on my connections to search for this flower, knowing that it was going to be a little expensive because it had matched her preference to a T– small cute white flowers with a mild smell. But since I’m scared she’ll draw back in terror if she ever finds out what I did, I can’t tell her that.\n「Is this flower to your liking?」\nWhen I asked while handing the flower basket over to her, she made a nearly imperceptible expression, but I knew well enough to tell that it looked happy, and then nodded.\n「This is a special flower for me」\nLooking like she remembered something, she brought the flower basket closer to her face. Snowdrops really were nothing but very mild-smelling flowers. But it appears that was enough for her to like it.\nAs the sender, there’s no way I won’t feel happy hearing something like that. Although I’d been pleased with myself, a short time later, she completely wiped the expression from her face again.\n「......I’m sure it was expensive, wasn’t it?」\nPanicking as I was, in front of me, she continued on as if she had determined my intentions.\n「There are many people who tell me they’re fans of my performances. But, I’m a doll, I think it’s such a waste to devote energy on me like this...」\n「That’s... but... this is something I want to do」\n「......I don’t understand. Why is a person like you, well... being kind to someone like me?」\nLooking bewildered even with the her limited expression, she looked even more charming than the flowers in her hand.\nHad I been a man at this moment, I think I would’ve been drunk on the atmosphere and blurt out 『Because I’m in love with you!』 . That was close.\nDespite thinking stupid thoughts, I squeezed out my courage from within my body.\nI squeezed and wringed.\nIf I could say this to her now, I wouldn’t mind even if I shrivel up dry tomorrow! That’s what I’d felt.\n「Uhm... If possible... I want to be friends with you...!!」\nIt may have been just a little, but upon my words, her eyes opened wide.\n「Friends with me? But I’m a doll...」\n「Eh? Is it impossible for you to be friends with humans?」\n「That’s not it. But, something like friends... is a luxury beyond me」\nI doggedly opposed her pessimistic views.\n「I don’t think so」\n「But I’m sure there’s- how should I put it... something 『lacking』 in me」\n「Lacking? To be friends?」\n「Yes.......」\n「But, on the contrary, what could be that something required to be friends?」\n「Huh？」\n「I think so long as one holds goodwill towards the other person, I think that’s enough. I’m sure you have feelings of like and dislike, right? That’s what made you especially happy about the present I gave today, isn’t it? ... That’s why, if perhaps, you don’t hate me. If you think you’d come to like me, then, uhm, please... be my friend...」\nI thought I came on too desperate.\nBut though it was only a light one, Miria clearly nodded back at me.\n「......you’re the first one to tell such kind words to me... Okay. I think I’d like to be friends with you too」\nI shouted for joy.\nAuthor’s note:\nPeople who feel uncertain about future since Lycoris is proceeding way too smoothly, raise your hand~\n＼(^o^)／Me!\nTranslator’s note:\nLol.

      "content": "Extra arc 『The Stage Ghost’s Cappricio』 Chapter 4\nI left home cheerful that day.\nMy goal today wasn’t to go see a play, but to observe the dress rehearsals.\nAnd Miria herself invited me to!\nShe said, 『We’re already friends, so you don’t have to bring presents when you visit. If you’re interested in our practices, please feel free to come and watch』！\nThat’s right, I got invited!!\nI want to yell it out now.\nYou can get friends even by assaulting them with gifts! So long as there’s enough sincerity!\nWith the tarts that my nanny baked for me this morning in hand, I headed to the doll opera in high spirits.\nAs soon as I stopped the carriage in front of the theatre at the time I’d planned from the start, a youthful man wearing a bright smile immediately approached me.\nIt was a face that I knew fairly well.\nFrandert Vernus. 22 years old.\nHe’s an acquaintance of Father’s and, since I visit this theatre quite frequently these days, he’s someone who’s collaborated tremendously with me.\nHe’s my comrade.\nWe got to know each other through Father and were very lively on the subject of how wonderful Miria Galant was from the very first meeting. Nowadays, he’s taken over the role of my escort — or rather, my guardian, in lieu of my busy father whenever I visit the theatre.\nI should’ve departed today with some time to spare, but surprisingly, he arrived at this place earlier than me.\n「Frandert-sama. I’m sorry to have kept you waiting」\nAs I tried to get off the carriage in a hurry, he took my hand and gave a bright smile.\n「No no. It’s a little embarrassing, but it’s just that I arrived way too early. I was in such a hurry...」\nSheepishly scratching his head, his facial expression was completely honest.\nAlthough I doubt it’s because he was born in an Earl family that’s famous for contributing to the promotion of local performing arts, his expression changes rapidly like in a play. In addition to his gentle appearance, he has a bright smile and honest nature. With this, I could see why he seems to be loved by women in high society.\nBe that as it may, the person himself didn’t have even one bad rumour floating about him and was exceedingly earnest. It seems he has a beautiful fiancee and treasures that person very much.\n「Besides, I’m not alone. My fiancee is in the carriage right now」\nAfter he said that, he pointed to a remarkable horse-drawn carriage that was parked.\n「Oh! Did the two of you come here today to observe? Would you mind introducing me to your beloved?」\nI ended up fangirling over the fact that I might be able to meet his fiancee who was rumoured to be a beauty.\n「No, she has something important to do after this」\n「Is that so. That’s too bad」\n「But if you don’t mind, I’d like to introduce you. She also wanted to meet with you」\nAs we cheerily approached the carriage where his fiancee was boarding, a lady alighted from it.\nShe was a lively-looking beauty who had a healthy glow on her skin. Her figure which was energetically walking towards us was slender and tall.\n（T-that’s unexpected... but so wonderful!!）\nThis woman, who was barely just shorter than the son of the earl, Frandert, introduced herself as Nilda. The shape of her dress that didn’t have so much as a bulge on her hips suited her dignified figure very well.\nI’d heard his fiancee was from a merchant family, but I was taken aback since I was imagining a rich, sheltered young lady. Instead, she seems to be a woman who wouldn’t feel uncomfortable even if she disguised herself in men’s clothes and got on a merchant ship.\n「I’m honored to be able to meet the duke’s daughter from the rumours」\nHer surprisingly soft voice was all the more wonderful.\n「Same here, it’s an honor to meet you too. But, “rumours”... you say？ Were they from Frandert-sama?」\n「Yes. What’s more, I’m acquainted with your father. It’s thanks to Duke Lilia that we have the privilege of trading with other countries without problems」\nI see, diplomatic work had an inseparable relationship with the tradings of merchants who come and go to other countries. She said 『we』 here, so Nilda-san was probably involved in her family business. A working lady. How cool.\n「......Thank you very much」\nOverjoyed that Father was praised at a place I didn’t expect and by such a wonderful woman at that, I couldn’t stop myself from smiling. Seeing me like this, Nilda-san had what looked like a motherly smile.\nM-my heart fluttered. Since I don’t really remember my mother that much, I’m weak to being shown these sort of maternal expressions.\n「I have some errands I need to do today, so I’ll excuse myself from here. I leave escorting Lycoris-sama to you, Frandert-sama」\n「Yes. I understand」\nOohh. So Nilda-san calls her fiance by his name, 『Frandert-sama』, huh? Considering the difference in status, that’s probably natural. But maybe they don’t use honorifics or they use nicknames when it’s just the two of them.\nBoth of them were smiling brightly at each other, what a sweet couple.\n「It’s such a shame I can’t tour together with you, Nilda-san」\nWhat I was saying was no longer lip service as far as I was concerned. I truly wanted to talk with her a bit more. Not giving up easily, I tried asking her 「Is the errand related to work?」. If her errand was something that could be finished quickly, then I definitely want to meet up with her afterwards.\n「No. Today is personal. I’m visiting a tailor shop at the royal capital high street to pick up a wedding dress」\n「Oh? Is someone going to get married sometime soon?」\n「Yes. Frandert-sama and I」\n....................ha?\nNilda-san said it like it was nothing. When I glanced at Frandert-sama confused, he scratched his head again looking embarrassed.\n「It’s around... oh right, 15 days from now, isn’t it?」\nNonononono.\nIt’s not ‘it’s around 15 days from now, isn’t it?’, Frandert-sama.\nThen what? Does that mean he’s visiting the theatre every single day and doing things like acting as my escort when he himself is preparing for marriage in approximately 2 weeks?\n「I-if you’d said something, I would’ve held back from disturbing you!」\nAt my outburst, the pair looked at each other.\nHowever, Nilda-san seemed to quickly understand my concerns.\n「......Ahh. Please don’t worry. I’m just going out to pick up the dress today. Besides, Frandert-sama was the one who suggested to escort you」\nThat’s certainly true, but...\nEh? Was that really okay?\nSeeing that I was unconvinced, Nilda-san continued as if covering up for her fiance.\n「Originally, the one who recommended Frandert-sama to get a hobby was me. He’s the type to get completely absorbed in one thing and ends up thinking about that alone. So this is his distraction」\nBut calling it a distraction was a little... rather, didn’t he get completely absorbed in his hobby of theatre-going?\nNilda-san was cheerful to the very end and didn’t seem to take the situation seriously. Hmm. Was I simply overthinking things?\nWhen I parted with Nilda-san, I began walking alongside Frandert-sama.\nI felt that something foggy remained in my heart.\nFrandert-sama, who was walking beside me.\nHe was my comrade.\nThat is, this person was 『someone who claims to be a big fan of an actress who’s around five years his junior and frequently attends her public performances』.\n...up till now, I hadn’t planned on faulting someone for actions I myself was doing.\nBut with the news that he was preparing for a marriage with his fiance in two weeks time added to it, doesn’t it straight up feel wrong...?",

      "content": "Extra arc 『The Stage Ghost’s Cappricio』 Chapter 5\nWhen Frandert-sama and I entered the theatre, the theatre manager quickly appeared and showed us to the guest seats.\nThis theatre manager was also indiscreet so the instant he saw us, he started thanking us for the capital both our families have provided to the theatre. I feel like this person always talks about money.\nThey were getting the lighting and sounds checked on this stage for the sake of commencing the dress rehearsal after this.\nMiria was already on the stage and when she noticed us, she gave but a small wave over at our direction.\nI surveyed the unoccupied seats around us and narrowed my eyes a little when I found a certain face I recognized.\nAn elderly gentleman sat expressly behind us even though there were so many empty seats available.\nHe had a scowl on his face as if to say 『I was completely forced into this』 while staring at the direction of the stage.\nIf he’s going to make that face, then he shouldn’t have come to see the stage dress rehearsal. But then, that was also part of his job.\nRonald Beret.\nA union member of the Royal Theatre Association and also a well-known drama critic. His criticisms are accurate and I used to really look forward to reading his commentaries. It’s unfortunate but I feel like he made a lot of slightly biased articles recently.\nThe reason he was watching the dress rehearsals was linked to his job as a union member. The Royal Theatre Association is an organization for the various theatres in the capital that looks out for the basic health and welfare of its members on the stage.\nWhile that was quite a respectable job to do, if I were to describe him in a few words, I’d say he was a bullheaded, ill-tempered, nagging old geez– pardon me, I meant grandfather. (1)\n『It’ll be such a stain for the union if Miria has an accident on stage when she’s now famous even in the capital. It’s something that will increase my inhuman and bothersome workload, but I guess it can’t be helped』 , says the man himself, Ronald Beret.\nThe way he said it sounded really sarcastic, so to keep my cool, I’ve made it a habit to change his lines in my head.\n『H-hmph. It’s not like I’m worried about you at all, okay?! It’s just that if an accident happens on stage, it will be a minus for the union... that’s why I’ll come and check from time to time! But that’s all, got it?!』\nOk!\nMr. Ronald, who was unaware of the great pains I took to just quietly let it go without complaint, purposely came up to us who’d chosen and sat on seats far away from him.\n「Good day, young miss. You sure are as enthusiastic as ever」\nHe calls me simply by 『young miss』. I hadn’t offered up my family name.\nI guess it’s unfair that he only knows my given name when I know his full name. But I don’t want to be thought of as little girl who talks big just because she’s sheltered under the authority of her duke family, and I especially don’t want to be able to win an argument or something for that reason.\nBy the way. Despite the fact that Frandert-sama and I were here as a pair, he purposely came to talk only to me. This was nothing more than because he disliked my attitude on our very first meeting. in other words, he and I nearly butting heads.\nWhile replying with a 「Yes, how do you do?」, I’ve completed my preparation for battle.\n「It’d be great if they’d let us watch her practices and performances everyday as much as we want, if possible Don’t you think so too? Miria’s voice is really wonderful that I can’t get enough no matter how much I listen to it... you don’t look like you agree, though」\n「Hmph. It seems young miss is dissatisfied with my review yet again」\n「If this is about the critique you made regarding Miria’s new performance, I don’t believe I can call that a review. You went too far ending it with 『it was such a boring performance』 after all the nitpicking you made. Even though it was such a moving performance and got a splendid applause at that, seems like it hadn’t reached your ears, huh?」\n「It’s your aesthetic sense that’s dodgy, young miss. Since you only listened to your own extremely enthusiatic applause, I bet you hadn’t bothered to look around. Blind supporters are defined by their lack of sense」\nI huffed in anger but I couldn’t let myself get heat up in an argument any further at a place where the dress rehearsal was about to take place.\nI decided to try converting the words Mr. Ronald said just now in my head.\n『There’s no way someone like you understands Miria’s good points! I know about Miria way better than you! It’s because I want that girl to grow that I speak to her harshly!』\nA tsundere who can‘t be honest in the presence of the actual person (telling a rival off ver.).\nMr. Ronald, who had no way of knowing what I was thinking, took my silence as a sign of victory and wore a smug look.\nI drove my thoughts about Mr. Ronald from my mind and tried to concentrate on the dress rehearsal that was about to start.\nThe rehearsal they were practicing right now was Miria’s new play that came up in our conversation.\nI’m told that one of the patrons had given spoilers about this performance while it was already starting its shows. So rumours has it that this dress rehearsal arose because they hurriedly needed to change the lines, few as those lines may be, with the real performance in mind.\nI only heard about it, but something like that does happen.\nAnyway, I can’t make anymore fuss when I was given this opportunity to specially observe such a practice with Miria’s help. In today’s practice, the exclusive troupe playwright, who was rumoured to hate people and hard to please, was also present. Since he was someone who never shows his face in public, this will be the first that even I’ll meet him.\nA person who fit that description that had been speaking with Miria. He was a tall, thin man whose face I couldn’t see very well from the place I was at.\n「That’s the playwright」, Mr. Ronald told me even though I didn’t ask.\n「He’s a well-known misanthropist. It’s mainly because of the rumour that no humans stood on this stage that he accepted employment in this troupe. ...Heard he got cruelly dumped by his lover when he was young. So his favourite type is, of course, 『a pure woman who devotes nothing but earnest love to another』」\nMr. Ronald said that sort of slander in a small voice only I could hear.\nBefore now, I would’ve taken a firm attitude thinking 『That’s this guy’s opinion, not mine!』, no matter what Mr. Ronald told me, but my cheeks spontaneously stiffened at these words.\nIn regards to the plays Miria performed, I’ve actually only seen the play where I saw Miria for the first time and the one she’s performing right now. In other words, I only know of two works.\nBut, I knew that Miria has always played the part of 『a pure woman who devotes nothing but earnest love to another』 so far. In the capital, it was becoming synonymous to Miria.\nEven the plot of this story which practice was about to begin for had that same impression.\nBurning with a single-minded passion for her first love, even though the object of her affection was simply a sheltered noble who was only good with words, the heroine couldn’t stop her earnest thoughts. Even after finding out he had a wife and children of all things, she offers her heart and in the end, dies after getting stabbed with a knife meant to be lodged into the cheating man’s heart.\nEven as the audience asks why do it for that kind of man, they could not go without tears at her earnest love. It had been that sort of performance.\nBut, what if that was the reflection of playwright’s preference? What if he was writing only girls like that because of backlash in the past where he was dumped by the woman he loved?\n（That’s a little... just a little... n-no, but if he were elavating his personal anguish as an artwork, it ought to be absolutely wonderful as an artist――）\nAs if reading my heart, Mr. Ronald gave a nasty smile.\n「Girly, ain’t it?」\n(1) I couldn’t find a word that can quickly define a person who loves to scold, so I used the word “nagging” here. This sentence is basically: “...he was an extremely stubborn, ill-tempered oldgeezer grandfather who loves to scold”.\nFiri: Lol, a tsundere jiji.",

      "content": "Extra arc 『The Stage Ghost’s Cappricio』 Chapter 6\nI headed to Miria’s direction after she finished the dress rehearsal with my nanny’s tarts on hand.\nSince it seems Frandert-sama has thoughts about the current revision of the lines, he was now in the middle of a discussion with the theatre’s manager.\nAs for me, I hurried my way to the dressing room, eagerly hoping to talk with Miria alone for a bit.\nWhen I neared her dressing room, I noticed that the door to it was ajar.\n（Was someone else there?）\nI quickly discovered that one of the people talking inside the room was Miria. Her voice was more nervous than usual, yet, it sounded somewhat cheerful. The other person seemed to be a man, his consistently low voice was hard to make out.\n（T-this is...）\nCould it be... could it the guy she has a crush on? The voice that was deep in conversation with Miria right now... This guy that could make her speak in that tone was the person Miria likes, isn’t it?\nBut wasn’t Miria a doll?\nNo, that sort of thing isn’t a problem. I was fully aware that even she had likes and dislikes. If that’s the case, then it might be very likely that she could even love!\nNow then, who was it!?\nFor a while, I’d been waiting cheerfully, hidden (for some reason) in the shadows. Then, the figure of the person who came out from the dressing room fell into my line of sight.\nHis messy hair, which felt like he didn’t pay much attention to it, was not pure black, but rather, slightly ashen in color. I’d be hard-pressed to say he had a refreshing impression, but it’s not like he was filthy. His beard was properly shaven and his clothes were... Nope, when I look closer, the cuff of his trousers are dirty.\nPerhaps equating misanthropes to shut-ins who don’t go outside is too irresponsible of me, but even so, if he’d been a little tidier, my impression of him would probably be totally different.\nComparatively, when I saw his features up close for the first time, I can say he was — surprisingly — good-looking. But the crease on his brows was so deep, he looked neurotic.\n（Mr... playwright......）\nI had strong mixed feelings about this.\nI peeked into the dressing room, feigning ignorance after that, but Miria was the same as always. However...\n「I’m pretty sure that gentleman who passed by just now was the playwright...」\nWhen I started the topic, her white cheeks immediately flushed red slightly. Now, I’m sure it’s love.\n「Yes. I’m sure it was. It was Elius-sama」\n「Elius... –sama?」\nSeeing me look at her very dubiously, Miria added.\n「That is...he’s a wonderful playwright. So I admire him」\n「And, he’s also the person you like, no?」\nWhen I tried speaking on the hopes she’d spill, Miria looked surprised and paled. 『Eh? What’s with that reaction!?』, I thought, as she faced me and lowered her head.\n「...I’m sorry. That’s beyond me...」\n「There’s no way that can that be beyond you! Love isn’t a monopoly of humans, you know」\n「Monopoly...?」\n「Err... in other words, what I mean to say is that love isn’t something limited to humans」\n「Love isn’t limited to humans...? -Is that... really true?」\nMiria murmured skeptically, then plainly shook her head.\n「I think love is a 『monopoly』of humans」\nSince Miria’s words sounded final, I was at a loss for words.\n「Loving someone isn’t something a doll can do. Even if it looks like dolls can, it’s just a sham. Looking at what people do, dolls can do nothing more than mimic outward appearances」\nMiria declared self-deprecatingly but firmly. The words, that were spoken as if to tell herself that, didn’t need my reply.\n「...... oh, that’s right. I... have something I’d like to ask you. You’re knowledgeable in a lot of things, and you even know about magic, after all」\nI nodded while feeling somewhat uneasy.\n「I’ll listen to anything you say. I don’t know if I’ll be able to answer though」\nMiria bowed her head politely, saying, 「thank you very much」.\nThen, with a light so unmistakably vivid in her eyes — she asks.\n「Do you know a way for a doll to become human?」",

      "content": "Extra arc 『The Stage Ghost’s Cappricio』 Chapter 7\nI’ll start from the conclusion.\nA magic that can make a puppet into a human does not exist.\nFor 『things』 imitating the shape of living things, there was a philosophy that these had a certain 『power』 that draws a line over being simple inorganic matters. That way of thinking exists in Japan and even in this world.\nIf I pull out Japan’s history as an example, there were things like hina dolls that were used to ward off evil and shikigamis that were used for onmyoudo.\nIn terms of dolls, which were 『things』 imitating human shape, there were rich variations ranging from folklores to ghost stories. I’ve heard ones where they end up walking or dancing, becoming replacements for humans, having human spirits dwell in them, or even growing out hair.\nEven in this world, there were ghost stories that are associated with dolls, but in addition to that, there were also stories about magic that influences dolls.\nFor instance. Magic that manipulates dolls at will by inserting one’s will inside them.\nAt this moment, even if they were equally inorganic matters, the level of difficulty between inserting one’s will into a doll and inserting one’s will into a pebble were completely different.\nA doll was a 『thing』 that imitated a human shape and it didn’t have a will of its own. Since it meets the requirement, it’s significantly easier to enter that 『humanoid shell』 compared to that of entering other inorganic matters.\nIn other words, this was magic that uses the 『power』 that tools called dolls have.\nThere were other magic that uses dolls. But what’s common among these were that people developed magic that turned dolls into tools.\nI tried thinking over Nival Galant’s magic in particular.\nOne could say that he was also a user of a magic that wouldn’t invoke without the 『power』 held by 『dolls』.\nPeople who don’t have a deep understanding about magic often misunderstand, but it wasn’t that Nival Galant could use 『magic that moves inorganic matter』 . Nival Galant’s magic was restricted to only dolls, you could say it was an incredibly limiting magic given that it could move dolls because they were close to human form.\nIn this regard, the dolls produced are not confined to, say, the material or its size. It doesn’t matter whether they are big or small.\nThe only restriction was that the form could not deviate from a typical human too much. It was no good, for example, if the doll was not made with all the human joints, and it was impossible to move a doll with wings on its back.\nThe appearances of the dolls themselves change in accordance to Nival’s magic.\nBut the dolls’ nature as tools remain the same.\nTaking the alterations that Nival personally desires, the dolls could change their figures. Due to his perfectionism, the alterations follow Nival’s desires for 『figures close to humans』.\nAnd his intention was for it to remain a shell. Without a voice of its own. It only moves with the responses drilled into it. An existence that only answers the desires of the wizard.\nEven Nival himself acknowledges that fact.\nNival’s automatons needed a long time in order to make up one body that accurately and precisely imitated humans.\nThough Nival made it clear that he was proud of his work at every opportunity, he also plainly expressed his honest opinion to the reporter that described his work as 『making a human』.\nWhat he makes was a 『doll』, there’s no way they could be 『humans』. That was what he stated.\n（I wonder if this person thought of 『Miria』 like this too）\nThe report was released prior to 『Miria』 being born.\nBut it was said that Nival Galant spent many long months and years of his life making 『Miria』. In other words, besides making other dolls, he poured all of his skills into carefully crafting 『Miria』 and brought her close to human.\nTo the automaton that couldn’t move without the responses drilled into it, he tried to teach every possible response and movement. Though there was no way of knowing what motivation drove him to do it, it was likely a task that required an extraordinary level of imagination and patience.\nThe catchphrase that 『Miria』 was 『The dollmaker Nival Galant’s greatest masterpiece』 wasn’t just for show.\nWhich meant, at the time of this article, even if Nival hadn’t publicized it to the world, he should’ve been working on 『Miria』’s creation.\nThus, 『Miria』, who finally came out to the world after his death, had been an automaton with an incredible thought process and was flexible enough to be able to come in contact with humans and lead a life quite similar to them.\n(Having spent time with her, I feel very strongly against what Nival Galant said. I don’t know how he could say something like 『there’s no way they could be humans』. –Or maybe...)\nOr maybe...\nMaybe there was a difference between the 『Miria』 that he imagined and the 『Miria』 I met. If so, could something have happened that even he, as the creator, did not foresee which led to 『Miria』?\nFor one thing, there was a possibility that 『Miria』 turned into something that surpassed his imagination of a being that was close to human.\nAnd for another, there was a possibility that the 『Miria』 I know and the 『Miria』 he knows, are separate beings.\nI was transfixed on the second possibility.\nHaving studied about Nival Galant’s magic, I was also led to investigate his closely connected personal life.\nHe, himself, stated that 『It was simply because of the very short time at the onset of my marriage that I could say my private life had been the most satisfying in my life』. Nival Galant’s wife had passed away soon after having just one baby girl with him.\nAnd even when the daughter, who he raised himself, became of age and got married, the one child she had was stillborn. She had a divorce soon after that.\nThereafter, without a specific partner and out of wedlock, she finally had a daughter but it seems she had been quite hard on this child. And then, the woman, having neglected her own health, died of sickness when the child was six years of age.\nThus, only Nival Galant and the six-year-old child that was his granddaughter, remained.\nNival wasn’t a particularly friendly man. Even those around him described him as 『moody』 or 『an artist for better or worse』, and I heard that he didn’t even ever let others near the place where he produced the dolls. I wonder how the life of a six-year-old girl went with that circumstance.\nThe girl’s name was Mari Galant.\nIf I followed the description of the young girl from the articles written about Nival’s personal life:\n『Pale brown hair inherited from her mother』\n『Large light brown eyes』\n『Based on those near her, they say her mother didn’t really shower her with love. She was jittery towards even the female reporter from start to end. She shows limited expressions』\n–if a girl like that had grown up.\nWouldn’t she be someone like the Miria Galant I knew?\n『The puppet opera’s best prima donna, Miria Galant. Her acting is the very. picture. of. a. human！』\nIt’s probably too absurd to suppose that Miria was actually human, and Nival’s granddaughter, at that.\nBut that supposition had completely made its place in my heart.\nAlthough she had limited expressions, I hardly felt that she was 『doll-like』 . Up to this point, I was thinking that 『maybe it’s because she was a magical doll』, but if I’d been told 『it’s because she’s human』, I would naturally believe that more.\nIt’s plausible to consider that her upbringing was the reason for her tendency to be a little self-deprecating.\nHowever, if I suppose that, then I’ll be met with another big question.\nWhen Miria appeared in the puppet opera’s stage, people accepted Miria as a 『puppet of humans』. That was because it was an actress that suddenly appeared in a theatre where 『living humans could not perform in』.\nAnd I couldn’t think of why someone would do something like pretend to be a doll and appear on stage.\nIf she were shouldering the risk of deceiving the world by pretending to be a doll, what could possibly be the reason for that?\nAnd, there was another mystery that was difficult to understand.\n–Miria had asked me.\nShe asked whether I 『knew a magic to turn a doll into human』.\nI really couldn’t believe that the question was made simply as a joke.\nThere was still the chance that all my deductions were just me thinking too much. The truth was, I had no choice but to ask her.\nI decided to try talking with Miria tomorrow or something. I was short on time since I’d spent most of it investigating. School was about to commence in two days.\nI definitely couldn’t discuss it in a letter.\nMy opportunity to talk to her would be tomorrow, just one day",

      "content": "Extra arc 『The Stage Ghost’s Cappricio』 Chapter 8\n「I am a puppet」\nIs what she said.\n「But, it’s true that I was born from a human mother. My real name is also Mari. ...I guess I got caught in the end. I was honestly terrified every time I’d meet with you. I’d thought that anyone who knew about real magic would surely expose my lies someday」\n「I don’t plan on exposing the lie. I just want to know your true motives. If you want me to keep it a secret, then I’ll keep the truth to my grave and if you don’t want to talk about it――」\n「No. I’ll tell you everything. It’s just that I don’t know where to start. If you’re fine with it, I’ll start from the beginning」\nIt seems Miria’s–no, Mari Galant’s mother really did treat her badly. She was practically neglected, and she’d get offensive words thrown at her when they met.\n「It seems that I’d been a kid who never cried, laughed or talked. My mother, to add to that, was yearning for one child that was stillborn — my sister from a different father. She told me plainly that she didn’t want to recognize a broken child as her daughter」\nI wonder what kind of thoughts she had, having such cruel words thrown at her.\nThe reason she hadn’t cried may be because she had no one to comfort her even if she cried. And the reason she hadn’t smiled or talked, was probably because there was no one near her that she could copy how to smile or talk from.\n「But, even though Grandfather was taciturn and unsociable, he did care about me a little. Even though I knew that the puppets were more important to Grandfather than I was, nevertheless, to me, he was my one and only family. And besides, even I had a dream as a child in my own way too. Even though I couldn’t naturally laugh or cry myself, a man who associated with grandfather taught me the existence of something called 『theatre』」\nHer tone became a little cheerful. When I heard that, I recalled something.\n「Could that person be... Mr. Playright?」\n「Yes. I was taught 『theatre』 by that gentleman, and became crazy about it. In theatre, even if the words I say were lies or even if the smiles and tears I had were fake, it was fine as long as I do it well. The fact is, I get to see people, who watch me pretend to cry out or act like I love someone, happy. ......but, as per my usual damaged self, even when my mother died, I didn’t spill a single drop of tear」\nWhen she talked about her mother, she certainly didn’t have any facial expressions. That, to me, looked like confusion over not knowing what the proper expression to make was.\n「I had a dream, and, even if it was only one, I had a family. I’d thought that was fine. I might be damaged, but I’d planned to live virtuously, to live as honestly as I could」\nShe took one short pause, and said in a tone one pitch lower than before.\n「......Up until that time came」\nUp until the time Nival Galant died, it was common knowledge that he’d been working on the doll that was said to be his best work. Of course, having lived together, there’s no way she couldn’t have possibly known that.\n「But Grandfather really hated having others see the creation of the dolls, so even I have never seen those dolls made. Grandfather collapsed in the workshop as he was... After he died, I went into the workshop. I saw the doll that Grandfather toiled over until the time of his death. And, I understood. What Grandfather wanted – what even he wanted, had been my sister from a different father.......There was already a name etched into the doll, 『Miria』。――it was the name Mother had prepared for my stillborn sister.」\nWith a scornful laugh most likely directed at herself, she continued her monologue sarcastically.\n「The doll that had my sister’s name had a.. very gentle and serene expression.......That’s to be expected. It was something that was born by having Grandfather pour all of the passion from Mother’s hopes. Thus, it’s debut as an automaton was already prepared. Furthermore, she’ll debut from the puppet opera with the first script that man has written... She had already been set to star on stage for her first time」\nI could feel the fiery rage in Miria’s tone.\n「......I... had never been so vexed. Even though I can’t even properly laugh or cry, it seems I’m perfectly capable of being jealous. I saw red. At that time, all of the pieces of grandfather’s work had already been finished and even its assembly was nearly completed. All that’s left was to fasten the arms and it should’ve been able to move... It was fine even if that part of the work wasn’t by grandfather. But, when I think of the promising future awaiting the doll sleeping so serenely, the moment its life begins... When I think of the doll getting all the things I’ve ever wanted once it opens its eyes...」\nI could easily imagine what was beyond the pause in those words. Even so, having told me she’d tell me everything, she said this clearly.\n「Without completing the doll, I hid the arms and the body away separately. Then, I pretended to be 『Miria』 and came to the puppet opera」\nWith this, a curious switching of a doll with a human occurred.\n「Did Mr. Playwright know about this?」\n「I don’t suppose he noticed. As 『Miria』, I always wear makeup when I appear in front of him」\nEven so, I suppose there’d still be some similarities. Even by changing her outward appearance with clothes and makeup, her voice was still the same, after all.\nWell, let’s leave how the playwright thinks of this aside for the time being.\nThe problem was about her. I’m not even certain whether I should call her 『Mari』 or whether I should call her 『Miria』.\n「......if it’s alright with you, please call me Miria like before. I’m more used to it」\nShe’d gone ahead and addressed my trouble.\n「Compared to the times I’ve been called 『Miria』 up to this point, the times I’ve been called 『Mari』 is honestly way too little that it is not even worth talking about, and...... it feels strange when I’m called by that name」\nWith her talking badly about herself, I couldn’t make myself say, “Then, I’ll go ahead and call you Miria”.\n「......You’re... human, right?」\n「I wasn’t made through someone’s hands but born from my mother’s womb. But, up to now, I’ve never once proudly declared 『I’m human』. Don’t you think that humans are people with an abundance of emotions and know how to love someone?」\n「......If they have their own thoughts and have a good command of their own words, they are human in my opinion」\n「Is that so? I think you’re saying that because you’re kind...... I thought the same when I first stood on the puppet opera stage. As broken as I am, I was still a human, after all. I might die in this place today. If not that, this performance might end in failure due to my lies, I’d thought.......But, the performance had been a success. I think, to the ghost, I looked every bit a puppet, not a human」\n「You... believe in the stage ghost?」\n「Yes, I do. A lot of people died in the past, performances ended up in failure, and it’s not just that. I, myself, could feel it whenever I stood there. I believe there is......something here. No, it may be better to say someone. If that wasn’t by magic, then it was definitely a ghost」\nI wasn’t in the mood to argue here about the presence of a ghost. I had one thing I had to ask.\n「So then, while believing that this place was dangerous, believing you’d get killed by the ghost, you still stood on the stage almost every day?」\n「It wasn’t that I might get killed. I thought, someday, I want to get killed・・・・・」\nI was... speechless.\n「I only have one dream now. If I happen to die on that stage, at that exact time, it would mean that the stage ghost recognized me as human. That it recognized me as somebody. No, at that time, it will prove to me that I was able to love that man. Right now, I’m sure my feelings are still a sham... I can do nothing but act well and I still can’t seem to understand my own heart, after all. But unlike a person, I’m sure a ghost will not be deceived by my acting」\nWith her voice bouncing slightly, she was the epitome of a little girl talking about her hopes.\n「......you’re crying for me, I see」\nThough she remarked on it, I didn’t realise that tears were dripping down my cheeks. I had been focused on something else.\n「......I... deceived you just like all the rest. I’m sorry. I told you I’ll be your friend, pretending to be human――。Even when you found out, you still cried for me. I... never dreamed that I’ll be able to make a friend like that.」\n“Then-“, as I attempted to say it, she said.\n「Someday, when I die on the stage, I’m sure you will cry for me. But, it’s okay if you cry only a little. At that time, I’ll be extremely satisfied, after all. After you’ve cried a little, please, give me your blessing」\nI frantically searched for words to reply.\nNot to her mention of death, but a method to prove love. If I could present it to her...\nIn an opera, characters certainly immortalize their love by dying. But surely there should be a way to prove that love to living people. Otherwise, wouldn’t it be too tragic?\nShe loved the playwright. She also loved her grandfather. It was evident to me when I heard her story. But, as an outsider, things like my opinions were meaningless here.\nAs long as she, herself, doesn’t believe it...\nAs long as she can’t prove to herself that it’s real and not an act...\n（......I’m... useless. Right now, I can’t even call out to her. I don’t even know whether it’s right to call her by either of the names...）\nAt that time, I couldn’t even think of a word to reply to her.",

And with Art – whether or not he meant to – making my everyday life busy, the time to think grew less and less.\nDuring that time, she would regularly send me letters and I would also send back replies.\nBut I hadn’t gone to watch her performances. Even when she invited me, I’d end up turning her down with ambiguous words.\n–I was scared, after all.\nEven when I opened her letters, my hands would shake on their own.\nThe letters were delivered to the Lilia residence via Frandert-sama. I couldn’t help but think that 『Actress Miria Galant’s obituary』 might someday be inside the letters instead.\nThat it wouldn’t be a reply from her.\nI picked up the pen, thinking positively to write about something that I wanted to relay to her, about what happened after the disturbance that Gift caused relating to the game.\nSomething like, after thinking, how I wanted to change myself even a little, to change for the sake of the future.\n～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～\nThank you for the letters as always.\nI picked up the pen today because I have something I’d like to tell you.\nIf I started with my current circumstances like always, I’d need several stationery just for that. A lot of things have happened to me. Even though I shouldn’t have had that much time since I’m a sixth year... honestly, there was a lot.\nSpeaking of which, I wanted to catch up and talk with you face-to-face one day. I was able to make a female friend at school. I want to introduce her to you. Maybe when I go watch your performance or something if possible.\nEven though you’ve invited me several times thus far, I couldn’t go watch. It’s not that I didn’t want to see you, but my legs would freeze up, thinking what if you fell down the stage. Please do find it in your heart to forgive me.\nBut now, I want to meet with you from the bottom of my heart, I want to talk with my friend, who I couldn’t meet for the past two years. The various things that happened to me recently seems to have, even just a little, made me grow.\nThere’s a lot of things I want to quickly talk about, but I want to start off with two things.\nThe first, is about what I failed to mention the last time we talked.\nOr, rather than failed to mention, I was in complete disarray, such that I didn’t know what to say. But now that I think about it, maybe this was what I should’ve told you.\nThis is what I feel. At the very least, I believe the love you concluded as fake, is genuine. Even if it’s meaningless now, I regret not telling you.\nI mean, I am an outsider to your love, but the thing I can confidently tell you is my own feelings.\nI believe that the love you have, which is fixed on just one person, is a true love that wouldn’t lose out to anyone. I’ve seen you when you talk with Mr. Playwright. Your voice becomes so cheerful that it’s impossible to conceal it.\nIt’s not just then, when I was with you, I’d always felt your sincerity. You’re a little timid and delicate, but I felt your passion for the stage.\nPlease, I want you to believe that too.\nCan’t you think of it like this? The stage ghost almost certainly had a caprice.\nDon’t you think that as the ghost kept haunting the stage, it recalled its love for the stage? That it was so impressed with the same love you had of the stage, that it thought to aid you in love.\nForgive me for saying something irresponsible. You did say there was 『something』 on the stage, but I honestly doubt that it’s something evil that pulls people to their death out of jealousy. I’ve seen that stage countless of times. But I’ve never once felt afraid.\nAnd the second thing, it’s about your given name.\nYou may be already aware, but I was troubled over whether to call you 『Mari』 or 『Miria』. In the letters, I always went with 『you』, didn’t I?\nI thought if I followed your request and called you 『Miria』, then wouldn’t I be denying the little girl named Mari?\nBut I realized something. I realized that no matter which name I use, the one that will come to mind will only be one person, you. You are an actress anyway, so having two names wouldn’t be odd. In other words, whichever name I use, they’re both yours.\nIf I call you Miria, it would be about the girl who desperately endured those days of loneliness when she was little. I’ll include the 『Mari』 who’s inside you when I call out like that. So please, don’t get hurt.\nIf you want to call yourself 『Mari』 in the future, please let me know. At that time, I’ll get to call you Mari and include the girl who pours her brimming enthusiasm onto the stage.\nI’m really looking to the day I go to see your performance, to the day I can meet with you.\nFrom Miria’s friend, Lycoris\n～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～\nThe reply for that letter came when I returned to school following its temporary closure.\nThe starting line, was the same as always.\n～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～\nTo my one and only friend.\nThank you for the letter. Really, thank you very much.\nWhen I read the letter, my tears kept falling on their own.\nAnd I could immediately tell. I could tell you’ve changed. I’m really curious as to what happened to you. I’m sure I’ll believe it when you tell me someday.\nBut perhaps you’ve changed bit by bit these past two years. I also believe that. I really can’t believe it’s already been two years since then.\nI’m sure it’s because I haven’t changed at all.\nWhen I read your letter, I looked at myself. In these two years, what in the world have I been doing?\nI want to change too. That’s what I firmly believe.\nForgive me for the shoddy letter. When I read your letter, I thought about many things. I want to meet your sincerity.\nAnd when I think of how to properly convey these thoughts to you, it would be having you see it on stage. It’s sudden, so if you can’t go, you can just refuse. But if you can, I’d like you to watch. It’s the current public performances. I’ve included tickets for the last show in the envelope. It’s for two. If you’d like, please come together with your fiance.\nIf you could come, I’d be incredibly happy. So please come.\nI like having you call me Miria. So, I think Miria is also certainly my name.\nMiria Galant\n～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～～",

To begin with, I cry everytime I watch Miria perform.\nWas there anyone who’d want to let her lover cum fiance see her bawling her eyes out? Nope, of course not.\nI did cry in front of Wolf in the past, but I am now already at a marriageable age. I definitely can’t let Wolf alone see my face when my eyes undoubtedly swelled up.\nI tried to get out of it, implying in the sense that「there’s nothing to worry about, it’ll be fine～」 but Wolf was stubborn about it this time. He wouldn’t budge.\nIt wasn’t exactly stubborn so much as cute.\n「......Didn’t you tell me it’s fine if I act spoiled with you？」\nThe slightly sulky expression he wore was like this. Cunning. Got to hand it to Wolf’s brand of cunning. At times like this, I could see that he clearly was his father’s, the Duke Ranunculas’s, son.\n...Yeah. Of course, I do remember saying something embarrassing like 『It’s fine to act spoiled with me』. And, it was then, right? The aforementioned first kiss chance.\nI see. Was this how acting 『spoiled』 was for Wolf?\nIf I had to say, getting escorted feels like I’m the one getting spoiled, though. So basically, for Wolf, saying 『I want to spoil you』 was something selfish? What the, that’s so cute! I feel my heart throbbing. It’s skipping a beat!!\n「Y-yeah. Then, thanks in advance for escorting me. I’m making you miss class though......」\nThat was the only response left for me to say.\nWolf smiled happily, so I ended up feeling happy as well.\nBelieve in the defence power of a handkerchief and thoroughly cover up my bawling face! Let’s go with that strategy.\n<br/>\nMiria’s show that day was a full house.\nThis was the last day for showing, but it seems like the show being performed today got really great reviews. After I listened in to what some of the people around me were saying, I could gather that some were back to watch the same performance for the second or third time now.\nIt turned out that Wolf and I were given seats right in front of the stage to watch from, the location was so good that I felt guilty sitting there.\nThe show was truly magnificent.\nThe aria which was sung several times in the story by the heroine Miria was playing as, was especially magnificent. Good songs would sometimes linger in our heads, but this piece of music was more than that.\n『Please listen to my voice. Singing my love to you, that’s my happiness』\n。\nHer acting was as good as ever – no, it was even better than usual, her pained expression made my heart wrench.\nThe plot was a story of a girl dedicated to her love.\nMaybe because I heard about her past, her role this time in particular, seemed to have a lot of parts that overlapped with her actual self.\nA little girl not blessed with a family and therefore longs desperately for one. She devotes everything to the guy she likes, unconcerned whether it pays off or not. The little girl simply persists to frantically, bravely, speak that her heart is true.\nThen, at the end of the final touching aria.\nThe applause gradually grew quieter and then suddenly paused.\nWith her head raised, she brought both her hands gently to her chest.\nAs Miria’s fan, it was only natural that I understood what that gesture meant. It was a gesture she does before she sings a solo.\nBut the musical performance was already over.\nIn the stillness.\nThe first thing that began was not a musical accompaniment or a dance, but a vocal based solely on her voice. It was delivered straight into the audience’s ears.\n『Please, listen to my song. I’m a doll that sings.\nFollowing the tunes you taught. That’s already happiness. It’s bliss.\nSongs that you wrote, wind the screw on my back, in the scorching summers to the freezing winters.\nI’m a doll that sings』\nChanging the lyrics of the story’s aria, Miria sings.\nIn the story, the heroine sings at the top of her voice that she was a bird that sings.\nThese words that were changed little by little, made it clear to me that Miria put her true feelings into the song wholeheartedly.\n（You’ve got it, Miria!）\nI was gripping my hands tightly.\nThere is no definitive form for love. But, there was a fixed method to get him to believe in it. By conveying it wholeheartedly.\nIt’s terrifying to confess one’s feelings, one would freeze in horror when they think they might get rejected. Still, she needed to put it out and bring it to his attention. For her, that method was by performing it through song.\nHer lovely aria continued.\n『Let us compare this love with the sea. For my heart keeps coming close to you like the waves that break shore and retreat.\nFlowers bloom through this song of love. On this stage, without grass or ground.\nLet us set this stage with love. Whether it be passion or grief, comedy or tragedy, that’s the proof someone lived.\nThat is where my heart is.\nPlease, listen to my voice. I’m a doll that cries. Singing my love to you. That’s already happiness. It’s bliss.\nSo with your song that showed me, who longed for love, to love.\nPlease notice how I feel.\nPlease, listen to this voice of mine.\nTell me how you feel.\nPlease, let your heart be mine』\nHer song ended with a wonderful long tone with her voice extending gradually as she reached the end.\nThat song that conveyed nothing but love in the story now ended in a form that seeked the other’s feelings.\nWhen I realized it, loud applause along with cheers and whistles had reverberated. It was different from usual, it wasn’t just because they were moved, but because they were also excited and uplifted. I, of course, also clapped along in a daze.\nOn top of the stage, she was perplexed by the thunderous ovation. But, the audience’s feelings was exceedingly clear to me.\nToday’s cheers were voices that were giving their blessings.\nThe audience all believed her. 「Aah, I finally saw a show that she performs where she gets a happy ending」, they say.\nThe heroine that only kept giving was now hoping for the heart of the person she loves. I believed that’s an element necessary to reach a happy ending.\nThe audience believed in the indisputably happy ending. Her voice had that much strength, after all. It was filled with love, so that’s why it moved people’s hearts.\nMiria was overcome with surprise and she looked on as the curtains lowered in front of her in a daze.\nOf course, the applause did not stop at all.\nWould anyone here now in the audience, who were giving a thunderous applause, believe that Miria was cold-hearted and not able to love?\nI, for one, would never believe it.\nYes, no matter what she tells herself.\nWhen I ran backstage, taking Wolf with me, it was just like the scene of a carnage.\nIf I were to say why, it was because the theatre manager was in a fit of rage.\n「Do you know how much effort and money I’ve put into making you have a strong image up to now?! Not getting affection back was the selling point! Doing this on your own accord...... I’ll make it so you won’t think of acting against people with the social standings of a puppet a second time! You’re not the only puppet here! I can always just sell you off to the highest bidder!」\nUpon hearing these absurd remarks, I decided to fire a surprise attack from behind the manager. I pushed the two precious bouquets I had on my arms onto Wolf so that they wouldn’t get crushed in the spur of the moment.\nBut before I could launch an attack, an arm appeared to shield Miria.\n「Don’t say absurd things! All the the automaton including her are the property of Mari Galant!」\nEeh!?\nFor a time, I forgot my anger for the manager and stared dumbstruck at the person’s face. Standing as if to shield Miria and flaring up at the manager with an incredibly menacing demeanor was the usual girly... no, the playwright Mr. Elius.\nThe adjective “girly” was blown out the window, right now, he was so cool! This guy had no wrinkles in his brow and was really very handsome.\n「I have an obligation to carry out the will of the departed Nival Galant. If you’re leading this troupe with that mindset, then I must consider adopting all the automatons and filing a case against you」\nI guess Mr. Elius’s proclamations might have some basis. As soon as he said that, the theatre manager quickly lost his vigour and, after mumbling some sort of dissatisfaction, left the dressing room with hurried footsteps.\nFor Miria or me, we’ll put the thing with the manager for later.\n「Elius-sama......What did you just say？ The automatons are... Mari Galant’s property？」\n「Y-yeah......」\nWhere had the vigour he had from before gone to? Pressed by Miria for an answer, Mr. Elius was now stammering. As he did so, the wrinkles on his brow made a comeback, and thus, it was the comeback of the incredibly crabby-looking, wasted beauty.\n「If you know something, please tell her!」\nI, too, flared up at him like Miria had.\n「You are......？」\n「Just put that aside for now！」\nPressed by my excessive force, Mr. Elius spoke while bewildered.\n「......I thought to tell you after we at least had progress in our search. But the truth is, Miria, you have a little sister. No, that girl is human, so in other words, you were made by Nival Galant, as a family member for that girl」\nIt seems this person loses the wrinkles in his brows when he’s trying his best to talk. The way he spoke about Mari Galant was gentle.\n「She’s a lovely girl. From her face to her voice, she looks quite like you. And just like you, she loves snowdrops. The first time I gifted her a small bouquet of it, she looked delighted and told me they smelled nice...... It seemed she also had an interest in theatre. That’s why, I’m sure she’ll get along well with you as sisters... But, after the chaos of Mr. Nival’s funeral, she suddenly disappeared. I’ve been looking for her since then... but there hasn’t been much progress in the search......」\nI asked him to highlight the part that I wanted to verify the most.\n「You’re sure that Nival Galant made 『Miria』 for 『Mari』?」\n「Yeah. He’d known his days were numbered. Which was why he wanted to leave a family behind for his granddaughter... He wasn’t much of a talker, but he worried for his granddaughter......」\nMiria shook her head upon Mr. Elius words.\n「I......can’t believe this...」\n「I can」\nUpon my assertion, Miria stared at me in surprise.\n「Rather, I feel a lot of things make sense now. You see, for a magician, a doll is a 『tool』. I think, to Nival Galant, dolls were important ......as tools. The automaton he created at the very end, in particular, was quite indispensible, in order for him to leave a family behind for 『Mari』......。You’d said it, right? That the doll had a very gentle and serene expression. I think that was what Nival wanted to leave for you」\nAfter digesting my words, Miria burst out in tears.\nShe cried out like a child. Clinging to me.\nThe truth was that she was much younger than me. So having that sort of expression wasn’t strange either.\nAfter I gave her a comforting hug, I looked at Mr. Elius.\nI don’t know if the rumour that he got cruelly dumped by his lover in the past was true or not. But at this very moment, the look he was giving Miria was particularly gentle.\nI’m pretty sure this guy has absolutely no idea what’s going on right now. But I think he’s a good guy. The reason his trousers were always dirty was probably because he’s been walking around looking for Mari Galant.\nI bowed my head at him.\n「I ask you. Please talk with her. Please, tell her about the Nival Galant you know. And then, please, listen to what she has to say」\nEven while confused, Mr. Elius firmly nodded his head.\nAs Miria was being led away by the meek Mr. Elius, she called out to me, her voice hoarse from crying.\n「Thank you, Lycoris」\nIt was the first time she’d addressed me without an honorific.\nI headed straight to the theatre hall that had become void of people during the turmoil in the dressing room.\nMy aim was to offer flowers at the stage.\nI left behind one bouquet of flowers in Miria’s dressing room. When I placed the other bouquet I had on the stage, a voice called out behind me.\n「Even you believe in the stage ghost, young miss?」\nIt’s been a while since we last met, but the nagging old geeze... I mean, the critic Ronald Beret seems to remember me.\n「......No. Actually, I still don’t believe it even now. Miria told me there was 『something』 here, but I can’t believe that it’s a ghost」\n「If it’s not a ghost, then what could it be then?」\n「It could be the passion of being on stage. Or maybe it’s something from the wild enthusiasm that the guests feel, left behind......？」\nMr. Ronald laughed at my sentimental words. But when he finished laughing, he got serious.\n「I don’t believe in it either. After all, I’ve wanted to see it so much that I keep coming here, but I’ve never been able to see it even once」\n「You... want to see the ghost?」\n「I wanted to see my younger sister. A long time ago, she died on top of this stage」\nOn top of this stage? There was something that bothered me from what he said.\n「When you say younger sister, don’t tell me......」\n「Yeah. It’s the actress that everyone’s saying turned into a ghost. I used to come here to watch the performances. It was embarrassing to get found out by the person herself, so I always sat at the back」\nI think I know a part of the reason why Mr. Ronald probably became a union member of the Royal Theatre Association now.\n「Do you know what really happened on this stage at that time?」\n「In reality, nothing really bizarre happened. Afflicted by a disease, a famous actress wanting to stay on stage until her final moments, died in the manner she wanted. Then, two girls fought over the role of being her substitute, and, because it was originally a tangle of mad love involving a man......it turned into something tragic. Two people were killed and one commited suicide」\n「That’s......」\n「Thus an innocent girl was made into a ghost」\nMr. Ronald looked so sad as he looked back to the past. And so, I intentionally talked loudly.\n「I’ll be looking forward to the critic for this performance. I’m actually a fan of the reviews you wrote」\n「Hmph」\n「It’s not a lie. When I came across your review, it had been an article about the first performance I’ve seen. Whenever I read your reviews, the emotion when I watched the show gets revived. Even if the last ones seems to have turned a little bit like sermons, I loved all of your reviews including those」\n「I got it, I got it. It’s embarrassing so stop it.......I don’t get what you’re worried about, but I ain’t senile enough that I gotta be cheered up just to write an article. I still haven’t got my fill of seeing wonderful shows and performers after all.......Good grief, it feels bad hearing you say all that with a straight face. Being the lover of this young miss has gotta be tough on you, eh, Mr. Casanova?」\nMr. Ronald grinned broadly, including Wolf into this. But maybe because I saw Wolf seriously nodding his head and deemed he wasn’t someone who would tease me, that I wound up quickly turning around to face the stage.\nAnd so, I gave the bouquet I had on hand a gentle kiss and tossed it on the stage.\n「......today was quite spectacular. It was fit for this stage. A pretty good performance」\nWith a satisfied sigh, Mr. Ronald added.\n「I wonder if that girly playwright will start writing something other than tragic love stories for once? The royal capital will probably be gushing out in excitement again if Miria Galant begins to sing happy duets with someone acting in the role of a lover」\nSince he sounded very happy as he said that, I unexpectedly realized how he truly was a 『tsundere』.\n「Don’t tell me, could the reason why you were so strict in your review be because you wanted Miria to play as a happy heroine for once, or something...?」\nMr. Ronald gave another「hmph」 and said:\n「......well, can’t let the playwright keep showing off how girly he is. Gotta give that guy a kick in the ass sometimes」\n「You’re right. Let’s look forward to a happy story from the playwright Elius」\n「Hmph... be that as it may, the future is still far off. This show is the starting point. Let’s make those chaps who didn’t come to watch this show regret it」\nI have a good feeling that the article this person will write for today will become so wonderful that it’ll remain in people’s minds forever.\nI spotted Frandert-sama right when I stepped out of the theatre.\nLooking positively cheery, he gave Nilda-san, who came to pick him up, a quick peck on the lips, not caring that others were looking.\nThe crowd in front of the theatre has already disappeared and there’s not a lot of people, but it was a public place nonetheless. Above all, I saw it perfectly! Even though I hid under the shadow of a pillar, looking unintentionally suspicious, Wolf took it all in stride.\nFrandert-sama looked like he didn’t notice us and continued talking.\n「Aah, Nilda, I’m so glad I can see you right now. It might be how wonderful the show was today or how much I wanted to kiss you after the show. It’s such a happy love story! It won’t be enough even if I talk about it all night! You’ll keep me company all the way, right, love?」(1)\n「I’d like it if you spare me from an all-nighter, but I’m all ears, dear」\n「I would love it if you watch the show with me next time. I expect the shows won’t be all tragic, one-sided love stories that you dislike from now on, after all」\n「Is that so? If it’s going to have a happy ending, then I don’t mind watching it with you」\n「Hooray!! Today is really such a wonderful day. It’s an evening where a love bears fruit and my wife is as beautiful and kind as always!」\n「I’m glad as well, since you look so happy. Yesterday, you were working until late and yet today, you’ve been so excited since morning. Well, I guess you’re always like that when it’s the day of a show. I came here worried, thinking you might collapse once the show ended, you know」\nThey should already be married close to two years, but they still looked completely like a lovey-dovey newlywed couple. I used to be worried about them, but of course, it was because I hadn’t gotten to know them yet.\nI was worried because, two years ago, Nilda-san went to pick up her wedding dress by herself. What I now know was that that had probably been something quite trivial for the both of them. To each his own.\nAnd, Frandert-sama wasn’t simply a straightforward guy. He knew about Miria’s love, at the very least, and was probably cheering her on. He believed that love to be genuine and was happy for her.\nNilda-san knows Frandert-sama way better than someone like me. Since they were lovers, that was natural, though.\n（Huh, so that means there had been absol~utely no need for my concern!）\nI covered a silly grin forming on my lips subtly with a cloth.\nAt any rate, I’m so glad Wolf went with me today. If I’d asked Frandert-sama to escort me today, I would’ve been a third-wheel right about now.\nI felt like I couldn’t hold back the exhilaration.\nA lot of people had been looking forward to a show like today and they shared the joy when it was actualized with someone important.\nRight now, it seems the wonderful aria was reverberating in my head.\n『Please listen to my voice. Singing my love to you, that’s my happiness』\nAfter I pulled Wolf’s hand and hurried to the carriage, I rattled on as soon as the door shut.\nLove sure is wonderful, huh, Wolf? It’s like a miracle when you like someone and even more so when that someone comes to love you back. But there’s quite a lot of such things in this world, and that’s why, the little things matter, which is why I conclude the world is wonderful. What I mean to say is, I was so touched. So being with you here right now with those feelings, I feel so happy, so much that my chest hurts. I feel really happy. That’s why, I want to kiss you, Wolf. May I?\nA question from the god of chance to Wolf. You lover asks if she can kiss you. What will you do?\n『I’ll hear her out at least』\n『It’s a rare opportunity so I’ll take it』\n→『Get greedy』\nThe title 『capriccio』 is a referring to a piece of music. It seems like it comes from an italian word for 『whim』. (2)\nTranslator’s note:\nSpent a great deal of time trying to translate the song and having a fun time trying to figure out how to rhyme the words.\n(1) The petnames that Frandert and Nilda call each other are from the past chapter, i.e. loved one and precious person. But I fixed it here, because it sounds weird in dialogue. From what I understand, Lycoris prefers English petnames to Japanese ones.\n(2) A capriccio is a piece of music that’s usually lively and freeform.\n(3) What’s Miria’s true age? I’m not too sure. I remember translating that she was older than Lycoris, but either I mistranslated something, or Lycoris did the math, and somehow concluded Miria’s true age?\nNot too sure how you all feel about how this arc ended... I have my own comments on it, much more so than how the last arc skipped several years. I took quite a few months to finish it simply because I couldn’t get myself to continue...\nBut I feel like I had to translate it for the sake of completing the series, so I hope there were some people that enjoyed it!",

      "content": "Request: Wolf’s POV and Lovey-Dovey\nI realized with a start that Lycoris, who was walking forward, was walking slower than her usual. When I studied her carefully, I saw she had furrowed her brows slightly the instant her right foot touched the ground.\n「Lycoris？」\nHearing the firm tone in my voice, her expression looked liked a child caught doing mischief. She had an anxious expression on her face that seemed to say 『what if he gets really angry?』.\nIf she knows I can’t act stern when she was making that expression, then I think I’ll be just a little vexed.\n「What happened to your right foot？」\n「Ah, uhm, it’s not a big deal or anything......」\nAs Lycoris said that, her gaze roamed to the sides. An action that seemed to unconsciously ask someone for help, but unfortunately, it was just the two of us right now. Because of an errand we were tasked to do by the teachers, we had headed to a place that didn’t have many of the regular students on our way back home. It was out of the way of the area of activity of many of the students, so there weren’t any pedestrian traffic.\nHaving remembered this as well, Lycoris looked resigned.\n「It seems my new shoes don’t quite fit. The size should have been just right but it’s a little tight on the heel......」\nI knitted my brows. Though I’d like to have a word with the person who made her shoes, there was a bigger problem than that. It was the fact that she’d tried to hide it from me.\n「......for now, why don’t you take off your shoe」\nWhen I kneeled down and said this, so that she’d hold onto my shoulder for support, Lycoris reached out her hand shyly.\nOnce I got her to remove her shoe, I saw that her heel had certainly swollen red, it wasn’t enough to turn into a wound, but it was warm to the touch.\n「Sorry, Wolf. I was thinking I’d just bear with it a little until we get back to the dorm. ... I mean, even if I ask you to leave me here and bring back another pair–」\n「I’ll firmly object」\n「See?」\n「It can be settled if I carry you」\nI thought it was quite a reasonable suggestion, but she immediately shook her head.\n「No, that would be too much. I’d feel too guilty. To put it bluntly, I don’t think my weight is something that can be easily picked up.......And I’ve been gaining weight recently. Even if you say you’ve been training, I’m also pretty tall. Frankly, I am a big woman, after all. So......」\n「Lycoris. I’ll be straight with you, I want to hold you in my arms and carry you. ...That’s why, your response should just be whether you’ll『 allow』 or 『refuse』 it」\nShe turned red and mumbled a tiny 「Uu......」 .\nThere was another little dispute over whether to carry her on my back or in front, but it was easy to persuade her who felt obliged to 『receiving assistance』 .\nHeld up in my arms, Lycoris appeared to be troubled over what to do with her arms that were moving freely while she was stiff with nervousness.\n「......Lycoris. It’s easier if you put as much of your weight on me」\nHaving nothing to lose, I went ahead and said it.\nSurprisingly, she quickly nodded, and leaned a bit of her weight to lean on my shoulder. It seemed I might end up saying something unnecessary if I opened my mouth, so I wordlessly carried her and started walking.\nWhen we made a bit of progress, she spoke to me at a position close to my ear.\n「Hey, Wolf, uhm... so what do you think of this?」\n「Hm? ......Let’s see. I feel this moment is much more satisfying than having the world in my hand」\n「A-a magnificent answer like that wasn’t what I expected ......aren’t I heavy？」\nAah, so she was concerned over that.\n「Let’s see, I doubt I could run very long if you tell me to dash with all my might while holding you in my arms... but if I’m simply walking with some rest in between, I could probably climb a mountain like this」\nUpon my honest reply, Lycoris looked pleased and she let out a small breath of relief.\n「I don’t think you’re heavy at all, though」\n「Mhmmm. But you should know that women want to have men tell them 『you’re light as a feather』」\nI imagined a situation exactly like her words and shuddered. I unintentionally added strength to the arms holding her.\n「Wolf?」\n「......No, I just... can’t help but be scared if you were that light. You might end up flying with the wind」\nAfter taking in my words, she giggled in my arms.\n「... sorry for laughing. It’s just... it’s really like you to say something like that...」\nWhen she said that with a light and easy-going tone, I began to laugh.\nHaving lost her nervousness, Lycoris wrapped her slender arms around my neck. Appearing to embrace me, she allowed me to carry her whole weight. It seems she pressed her face on my collar to hide the smile on her face.\nIt came to no surprise that I lost composure at having her warm, tender touch offered to me quite innocently.\nEven then, her laughter did not cease, its light vibration transmitted to me.\nHonestly.\nWhat I have in my hands right now was much more splendid than world domination.\nThough she told me to act a little more spoiled, I’ve long been spoiled rotten by her. With her kind voice and bright smile, I’ve always gotten spoiled. This might be what it’s like to have a mother.\n–But, she wasn’t my mother.\n「Lycoris」\n「Yeah. What is it?」\n「Would it be better to go to the medical office? 」\n「Yeah. But it’s a pretty long way to go, isn’t it. Will you be okay?」\n「Of course」\nWhen I smiled, Lycoris had an expression that looked at ease.\n「――But, it certainly is quite a distance」\n「Thought so, shall I get down? If you lend me your shoulder, I can hop on a foot！」\nI, of course, had no plans to let her down at all.\n「It’s alright. I plan to safely deliver you until we get there. That’s why, if I accomplish this duty...... could you give me a tiny bit of reward？」\nWith the hidden meaning in the way I said those words, Lycoris stopped moving in surprise.\nBut even as I waited awhile, she didn’t remove those warm arms that were wrapped in my neck. She didn’t even ask to be let down. But her white cheeks, her neck, they turned so red that it couldn’t be concealed.\nI also thought I’d like to punish her a little for hiding the matter about the shoe sore from me.\n–And, quite frankly, I also like her embarrassed face very much.\nMy lover told me 「it’s okay to act spoiled」.\nIsn’t it human nature to want to know how 『spoiled』 I can go?\nAuthor’ note:\nJust as the title says, the topic is 『Wolf’s POV』 and 『being lovey-dovey』. I wonder if this feel is okay? This request is probably the most requested that I get.\nWolf’s POV really is hard. I’d like to think that I have no idea why that is, but it’s probably because Wolf doesn’t have the attribute to be a straight man. I like to summon Shade for the straight-man role.\nIt’s hard, but I really enjoyed writing it. Thank you very much for everyone who requested this!",

      "content": "Extra Arc\n『Modern-era』ver Shade\n*An extra-arc gag chapter. It’s a ‘If the characters in yandere otome~ were high school school students in the modern era’ kind of story. The character developments are different from the original story and contain elements of what ifs.\n「It seems like Shade turned into a delinquent......」 said Crinum, hanging her head down in shame.\nCrinum and Shade were my cousins, but the two were brother and sister from different mothers. The two had complicated family circumstances.\nThough I left out the troubles of the past, the two’s sibling relationship wasn’t so pleasant even now. My aunt, Crinum’s mother, stuck to an attitude of 『having no relation』 with her stepchild, Shade, and she compels Crinum to have that attitude as well.\nBut Crinum, herself, worries about Shade and often comes to consult with me.\n「Shade, a delinquent......？」\nI immediately recalled the time when Shade had only just come to the Rangrutz home. At that time, being three years old, he’d been a sweet angelic child with adorable, puffy rose-colored cheeks.\nHe grew up before we knew it, and the sad thing was, he became very cheeky. I wonder if he started smoking or something when he finally became a second year high school student.\n「That’s right. Recently, he’s even been coming home late...... and the smell of perfume is often on his clothes, based on what the maids tell me. I hear he’s been working part-time, but it looks like he faked his age a little and is working in a store that handles alcohol......」\n「I see. Sort of sounds like he’s dipped a foot into the nightlife. If the school finds out, it would probably be enough to get suspended, wouldn’t it? But still......」\nI tried to imagine Shade shaking a cocktail in a bartender getup. Then, I tried to arrange beautiful, mature onee-sans, who like to make passes at younger men, and the like around him.\nIt became quite the picture.\n「――it is kind of irritating that he’s straying from the right path just to pointlessly look cool. I mean, it’s not like he’ll do anything daring like get a pompadour or wear a long tunic」\n「Lycoris......。I think that way of thinking is a bit cruel」\nAnyway, it came down to me to try talking to Shade.\nIn truth, I think it would’ve been better if Father was here.\nFather loves Shade like he was his own son, so much so that there was a room set up just for him at our house.\nLikewise, Shade was also considerably close to Father and he seemed to have had various consultations alone with him about particularly difficult times in his junior days and such. Said Father was currently on a business trip abroad.\nSo, after I had dinner together with Shade, who visited our house for the weekend, I decided to lecture him.\n「Shade. Could you wait for a while before going back to your room? I have something to say」\nOnce I announced this with a formal sounding tone, Shade raised his eyebrow.\n「What is it？」\n「It seems you’ve been coming home quite late recently」\n「Maybe. I’ve been busy playing around with a new friend I’ve made」\nHe said, acting indifferently and playing dumb.\nWhen Shade came to the house, he didn’t make the mistake of having the smell of perfume or anything on him. If he had, he would’ve gotten pressed for answers by his nagging cousin, me.\n「The friend who makes you smell like alcohol and perfume？」\n「......did you hear something from Crinum?」\n「I take that as a yes, then」\nShade hmphed and did an extremely uncute type of smile.\n「I’m working part time for a while to learn about society. That’s it. I have no particular interest in cheap alcohol or cigarettes」\n「Y-your way of saying it is so uncute......」\n「I’d appreciate if you don’t describe me as that. In the first place, it’s an insult to call a guy who turned sixteen, “cute”」\n「It can’t be helped. For me, you’re my cute little brother, after all」\n「I’m not your little brother」\nSince Shade spoke in an icy voice, I got nearly overwhelmed.\n「To begin with, it’s not like you’re even family so please stop acting like you’re my legal guardian」\n「I am your family！」\n「......you’re wrong」\nShade abruptly turned away.\n（You’re going to say that, huh? Well fine！）\n「If you’re going to go that far, then be prepared, Shade! I won’t be lenient on someone that’s 『not even family』！」\n「......like what can you even do? Are you going to tell the school? Then what if I don’t stop doing it, will you do it even if I drop out of school?」\n「Nope. I’m not going to do something as tedious as that!」\nI gave a snap of my fingers.\nOn top of the rack that our house’s capable butler soundlessly and smoothly pushed in, was a large television.\n「What’s prepared here, you see, is Father’s treasured 『My angels’ growth to adulthood records. Special compilation: Lycoris & Shade edition』！」\n「......Ha?」\n「My father went abroad on business trips a lot when we were young, right? So, it seems our maids and butlers were given the task to record our lives. These are the ones compiled into a video」\n「......Geez, that man......」\nWhen I, myself, found out about this, I also let out a murmur similar to what Shade did just now.\n「And so, I don’t know if you remember this or not, but, when you were about four years old, it was the time when you’d been like the cutest angel. You said something like this」\nI let out a breath and then reproduced the words Shade said long ago with clear pronunciation.\n「『When I grow up,... my dream is to be... Lycoris-oneechan’s・・・・・... bride！』」\nThe butler said 『that’s right』 and kept on nodding. He had a very good memory, so you could say he remembered more of our childhood than even we knew.\n「uwAAAAAAAA！！！！！」\nShade cried out as if to drown out my voice. However, he was too late.\n「And this is the video evidence......」\n「......！！」\nThough Shade rushed out towards the television, not caring about appearances, but the butler gently kept him back.\n「Shade-sama. What’s in here is a copy」\n「Exactly！ Isn’t that obvious？ Now, Shade！ Can you still bring yourself not to listen to what I say now？ Wanna have it screened？」\nAs I confidently lay on my back with feet outstretched, Shade fell to one knee in defeat.\n「Y-you...... you’ll go this far?！」\n「I will！ I told you “I won’t be lenient”, didn’t I?！」\nThen, I vigorously kept on talking like I was snapping at him.\n「I would’ve tolerated it if you simply went to the extent of wearing a pompadour! But to think, working part-time by faking your age！！ Even if you can control yourself, it’s not just the allure of alcohol and cigarrettes is the problem！ What were you planning to do if you got involved in any trouble！？Don’t think I’ll bother worrying about you by then！！」\nBy the end, I was already saying this in tears.\nBut after Shade stared hard at the tearful me, he slumped his shoulders, looking defeated.\nThen, he made a long, deep sigh.\nCrinum, who noticed his strange behavior in the first place. Father, who offered the video recordings. And, me and the butler. This all-out attack – had been a victory of familial love.\nI wonder why this Shade turned delinquent.\nHe’d been an honor student when, before he knew it, his beloved older cousin got engaged, so he rebelled... if that were the case, then it’d be awfully sad.\nThis Shade didn’t become Lycoris’s younger brother, so this backstory is where he had a feeling of heterosexual love for Lycoris.",

      "content": "Extra SS『Sibling Squabble』\nThe timeline is roughly around two years before the start of the school arc. During the siblings’ day off.\nLycoris and I quarrel pretty often.\nThe cause varies, but they were mostly about trivial things.\nCase in point were our regular bickerings.\nWe’d always get annoyed by a usually pardonable remark and respond back with a biting retort. With that done, the other would then retaliate back with equally biting words since we were both headstrong. After it came to that, we’d go with the flow and instantly plunge into a squabble.\nWe both wouldn’t want to hear what the other was saying so our clash of wills would continue for a little while.\nHowever, there was a great deal of people who paid attention when we fought, whether it be at the Lilia residence or at school. Things indeed calmed down when we took innocent bystanders into consideration and we’d also reflect that it wasn’t mature to make others worry.\nThus, at approximately fifty-fifty ratio, one of us would yield. And that would be the end of the squabble.\nBy the way, Wolf was not included in the 『innocent bystanders』.\nThat’s because that guy wouldn’t care less if Lycoris and I were arguing or being cold to each other. Rather, he seems somewhat livelier in worrying for Lycoris more than usual so the irritation towards him would make me lose my resistance in 『being the one to yield in the fight』.\nYou could say some of the quarrels ended thanks to Wolf as a result, but I naturally won’t thank him for it.\nIn any case, that was how siblings quarreled in our family, so there were occasions where we don’t remember the reason the quarrel started in the first place.\nBut the situation this time was a little unusual. I clearly remembered the words I said that started the fight. However, it wasn’t clear what made me feel annoyed to say such a thing.\nIt all started when I went along with Lycoris’s hobby and accompanied her to theatre that night.\nWe were on our way home. There was nothing to see outside since it had already turned dark, I’d been sitting on the opposite side and looking at my sister, who covered her face with a cushion. Lycoris had the tendency to empathize excessively with stories, so she’ll often be moved to tears even with books or dramas.\nI faced her in her current state and said this.\n『You don’t have to bawl so much......Not to worry, Elder Sister’s oh so beloved actress is celebrating the show’s success and drowning in wine or something by now』\nI’ll say this beforehand but I pride myself for not being that insensitive of a person.\nI knew at least that there’s no way my sister would say 『you’re certainly right. All’s well that ends well』 when she gets told these sorts of things.\nMoreover, the way I said it was also nasty. It was said with some suggestion of sarcasm that even I thought was heartless.\nNeedless to say, Lycoris got angry.\nNo sooner had I wondered why she was looking at my face with that expression on her face like she didn’t understand what I just told her, then she’d thrown the cushion on hand at me.\nAfter that, it proceeded in exchanges such as 「Learn some delicacy！」「It’s the truth」「There are ways to say things! And don’t you dare say it was meant to be reassuring！」 , and was brought to a finish with 「Don’t talk to me for a while！」.\nIt’s true that it wasn’t meant to reassure her. If it was, it would have been phrased a little better. But it wasn’t meant to aggravate her while she was down either. It wasn’t meant to be so petty.\nAnd so, the ensuing quarrel was lasting unexpectedly long.\nIt seems Lycoris had absolutely no plans of being the one to apologize this time round. Well, that’s probably to be expected.\nWith that, the only apology that will be given will be coming from me. I knew that, but it’s unwise to go and apologize when I haven’t found an answer to the question I’ll surely be asked.\nLycoris will definitely ask.\n『Why did you say something so cruel』\nNow. Why did I do it?\nWhen we quarrel at the Lilia residence, I would first anxiously ask someone from the servants, 『is there something I can do?』. And if they all shake their heads, the last person I’d approach would be Father — Duke Lilia.\nHe basically adopts the principle of laissez faire with regards to our fights.\nThere are even times he welcomes them. The way he sees it, quarrels were proof that we were getting along.\nEven now, it seems Duke Lilia had no plans to even step in, let alone mediate, so he told me this like it was an occasion to chat.\n「Shall I wager a guess as to the reason for the quarrel?」\nI was taken aback by these words.\n「You know? Even though you weren’t there?」\n「That’s right. I only made my own inference and I didn’t hear any details from Lycoris. No foul play」\nUnder my prompting, he smiled and said this confidently.\n「On your way home from the theatres. It was just the two of you inside the carriage. Judging from Lycoris’s behavior, it seems you were the cause of the quarrel this time」\nI gave an affirmative.\n「I’d guess you purposely said something to make Lycoris mad, didn’t you?......you really are bad at handling Lycoris when she cries」\nHis words entered my brain.\nI suddenly felt burning hot.\nIt’s because I was made to realise my own feelings that I wasn’t conscious of at all.\nAh, so that’s why.\nAt that time.\nProbably because she did not want to be seen crying, she was burying her face in the cushion.\nHer thin shoulders slumped.\nIn the quiet carriage, you could hear her crying at fixed intervals.\nI couldn’t take too much of seeing her so lifeless.\nIt’s better if she’s angry at me, that was what I’d thought.",
