      "content": "When I was a kid, I used to be scared of needles.\nActually, I still am.\nWho in their right mind would enjoy having something sharp jabbed into their body?\nBut there’s no other way around it.\nThere aren’t many options when it comes to taking medication.\nI angled the needle and stuck it into my bandaged arm.\n“Ugh.”\nI can never get used to stabbing myself with a needle.\nAfter giving myself the shot, my mind momentarily went blank.\n[8 hours]\nA small screen popped up in the corner of my vision.\nIt meant I could stay somewhat sober for the next eight hours.\n[7 hours 59 minutes]\nThere goes a minute.\nMy mind feels foggy.\nWho the hell lives with this kind of timer floating in front of their eyes?\nYou’d have to be completely insane to tolerate this.\nWell, I guess it makes sense in a world like this one—a fictional one.\nIt's similar to those RPG protagonists who always have their status window popping up.\n“Nice.”\nThe shot’s effects started kicking in, and I felt... better.\nMy mind calmed down. As long as I had the drugs, I could keep going.\nBeing healthy feels pretty damn good.\nIt’s clear when I think about how awful I felt before I took the shot.\nWhat happens when the drugs run out?\nI’ll worry about that when the time comes.\nIf I can still think, that is.\nSome of the medications don’t even require injections.\nI can just swallow them like pills.\nIn emergencies, they give me around 15 minutes of extra time.\nSo, as long as I keep a few emergency pills on hand, I can manage to leave the house.\n“Not bad.”\nI smiled at my reflection in the mirror.\nThe girl in the mirror, with brown hair falling to her shoulders, smiled back.\nHer name is Yoo Seo-Ah.\nShe looks about middle school age and is... pretty decent-looking, I guess.\nHer clothes are a bit dirty, though—that’s a problem.\nThe mirror is cracked.\nIt got that way the last time I punched it when I didn’t take enough meds.\nThat’s also how I ended up with bandages on my arm, thanks to the glass shards.\nI was angry back then.\nI mean, I got sucked into a novel, and out of all the novels, it had to be this one.\nNot to mention, I ended up as the protagonist’s dying childhood friend.And to top it off, they even swapped my gender for some reason.\nAt that point, I was seriously considering just treating this like a dream and ending it all.\n“But now, I don’t want to die at all. I’m happy.”\nI smiled into the mirror.\nThe happiness buzzed through my nerves, almost painfully so.\nIn the novel, Yoo Seo-Ah is already dead from a drug overdose.\nOr maybe she died because she didn’t have enough drugs.\nEither way, if you use the medication carelessly, that’s what happens.\nBut unlike the novel, I’m still alive.\nThat’s what really matters.\nLooking at the table, I see the ten pills left.\nEach one will buy me about 15 minutes.\nThe injectable drugs are in small glass vials.\nOne shot gives me around eight hours.\nAnd then there are the five painkillers.\nI use them when the pain gets too bad.\nThey also make me feel really good.\nThat’s all the drugs I have left.\nI’ve been saving them, using them sparingly.\nIn the long run, I don’t have nearly enough...\nHeh.\nI don’t know why, but I can’t stop laughing.\nLaughing feels good.\nIs it because of the drugs?\nNo way.",

      "content": "[7 hours 43 minutes]\nThere’s still plenty of time. Just to be safe, I packed some pills and painkillers.\nHonestly, I wish I could bring the injection solution with me, but I don’t have a proper bag for it.\nAnyway, I’m all set to go out now.\nAll that’s left is to actually step outside.\nI try not to think about my worn-out clothes and the bandage wrapped around my arm.\nI rummaged through my wardrobe, but there wasn’t much to choose from.\nA couple of simple shirts, and everything else looks like rags.\nIs it my fault I’m poor?\nNot much I can do about that.\nI just told myself it’s a casual look, and that made it feel a bit better.\n“Alright, time to meet the protagonist.”\nWe’re supposed to be childhood friends, but the protagonist hasn’t come to see me at all.\nAt this rate, he’ll only show up at my funeral.\nGuess I’ll have to go to him first.\nIn the novel, the protagonist didn’t see Yoo Seo-Ah again until she was half-dead.\nThat’s what happens when you don’t keep in touch for so long.\nAnyway, I’m in a pretty good mood right now.\nAm I excited to meet him?\nWith that thought in mind, I reached for the doorknob.\n[Warning: External stimuli can reduce your remaining time.]\nA warning message appeared.\n“...”\nExternal stimuli shorten the time I can stay clear-headed.\nThe drug’s effects wear off faster.\nIn other words, my good mood won’t last long.\n[Warning: External stimuli can reduce your remaining time.]\nEven though I’ve packed pills and painkillers, seeing that message made me hesitate.\n“But I still have to go.”\nI need to meet him.\nI can’t avoid it this time.\nI’m low on money and can’t afford more meds unless I borrow some.\nThe protagonist has plenty of cash.\nHe’s kind-hearted, so I’m sure he’ll lend me some.\nI hope.\nI can’t just call him either.\nYoo Seo-Ah’s too poor to own a luxury like a phone.\nAnd even if she had one, she probably would’ve sold it.\nThese meds are ridiculously expensive.\nThere’s no one else to turn to.\nMy parents are dead.\nThere are no adults around to help.\nThis world is nothing like the one I used to live in.\nLife here is harsh.\nSo, where’s the protagonist?\nHe’s at the Awakener Academy.\nEven without a phone, I can track him down because of that.\nIn every story, the protagonist always has some kind of special power.\nHere, they’re called Awakeners.Monsters have started to appear, and the Awakeners are the ones who fight them.\nGates open, dungeons appear...\nThe protagonist fights monsters and bad guys alike.\nIt’s the typical fantasy novel world.\nFor the record, Yoo Seo-Ah’s parents died in an Awakener-related accident.\nThe protagonist also lost his parents to monsters when he was young.\nHe had adults around, but none of them cared enough to really look after him.\nThat’s why the two of them became childhood friends.\nThey bonded over their shared tragedy.\nBut after his Awakening, the protagonist was whisked away to the academy.\nYou could say he was dragged off to it.\nThat’s how the law works here.\nAwakener? Straight to the training academy.\nHe used to live in the same rough environment as Yoo Seo-Ah, but now he’s living in the academy dorms.\nHe used to come visit Yoo Seo-Ah once a week, but it’s been a long time since his last visit.\nWell, he is the protagonist, so I guess he’s busy.\nThe protagonist has no idea how much worse Yoo Seo-Ah’s condition has gotten.\nShe’s been hiding it from him all this time.\nIn the novel, Yoo Seo-Ah died because the protagonist stopped paying attention to her.\nI’m only still alive because I’m not her.\nThis is what happens when people neglect their childhood friends.\nWho leaves their sick friend alone to have fun at the academy?\n[7 hours 23 minutes]\nI’m lucky to have this timer showing me when to take my meds.\nThe Yoo Seo-Ah in the novel didn’t have that, so she died quickly.\nIf you take too many meds, they become poison.\nSure, taking more makes you happier, but still...\nFor now, I’m taking them in moderation, so it’s fine.\nThe fact that I’m smiling naturally must mean I’m healthy and in good shape.\n“Ah... I wish I could go to the academy too.”\nI just want to catch a break.\nBut forget the academy—I don’t even go to a normal school.\nPublic education is a broken concept in this world.\nThe wealth gap is huge.\nThat’s why there are slums in the middle of the city, with plenty of empty houses scattered around.\nWell, at least that means I have a place to live.\nWith these thoughts running through my head, I kept walking toward the academy.\nThe place is massive, so it’ll be visible soon.\nThankfully, it’s within walking distance.\n“Hmm. Unauthorized visitors aren’t allowed inside.”\nI was stopped at the entrance.\nThe guard blocked my way.\n“I’m here to see a friend.”\n“Did you contact them in advance?”\n“No.”\n“Hmm, then I’m afraid I can’t let you in.”\n“Ah...”\nTurns out, there were more obstacles than I expected.\nIt would’ve been nice if I at least had the protagonist’s phone number.[3 hours 40 minutes]\nIt was a long walk.\nI’d been walking for three or four hours now.\nI didn’t have enough money for public transportation either.\nThere was no way I could walk all the way back home.\nIn fact, I probably wouldn’t even make it if I tried.\nIf I could borrow some money from the protagonist, I’d take a taxi back.\nAs I stood there, disappointed, the guard spoke up again.\n“If you have a name, I can send a message. No promises, but I’ll let them know someone’s looking for them.”\nThankfully, it wasn’t over yet.\nThe guard was kinder than I expected.\nIt might take some time, but it seems like I’ll be able to meet him after all.\n“Oh, thank you! His name is Han Si-Hoo. Tell him Yoo Seo-Ah is here to see him.”\nI gave him the protagonist’s name.\n“Han Si-Hoo? Isn’t he that famous kid? I heard he’s a middle schooler who beat one of the high schoolers.”\n“Really?”\nIt’s still early in the story, but it seems like he’s already making a name for himself.\nIf I were the protagonist, I could probably do that too.\n“If you were just a journalist or something, I wouldn’t have even bothered. I’m only making an exception this time.”\nThe guard is really nice.\nI noticed his gaze lingering on the bandage wrapped around my arm.\nI casually moved my arm behind my back.\nDo I look that pitiful, dressed in rags?\nI’m perfectly happy on the inside, though.\nPeople really shouldn’t judge others based on appearances.\n“Thanks.”\n“No problem. Just leave your contact info, and it’ll take some time.”\n“Um... I don’t have any contact information. Can I just wait here?”\n“...”\nThe guard let me sit in the waiting area.\nI sat there, watching the academy students walk by.\nSince I was by the entrance, I didn’t see many, but the campus was huge.\nSome students used strange teleportation magic, while others carried spears on their backs.\nA woman who looked like a professor floated a glowing orb beside her.\nThis world is straight out of a novel.\nIt’s a shame I’m powerless.\nI wonder if any of those people could cure Yoo Seo-Ah’s illness.\nProbably not.\nHealing Awakeners can only do so much.\nThey can reattach severed limbs, but they can’t even cure the common cold.\nIt’s a weird system.\n“If I had powers, I’d be attending the academy right now.”\n“Yeah, yeah. The world’s an unfair place.”\nThe guard chimed in from beside me.\n“Haha...”\nThe protagonist has been defeating bad guys with his powers since he was a kid, but Yoo Seo-Ah?\nShe’s never accomplished anything.\nWell, actually, she did... right before she died.\nBut she wasn’t on the protagonist’s side at the time.\nHuh?\nSuddenly, I feel like dying.\nWhy did I have to end up as this character, in this messed-up novel?\nHonestly, life would be better without the meds.\nEven if I manage to borrow some money and get more drugs, then what?\nI’ll just keep taking meds, waiting for money, buying more drugs...\nDo the drugs even cure my illness?\nWhy wasn’t I made the protagonist?\nIf I had to be an extra, couldn’t I at least have gotten a better role?\nYoo Seo-Ah, of all people.\nI feel like I’m losing my mind.\nSomething’s seriously wrong with me.\n[2 hours 11 minutes]\nI reached into my pocket and pulled out a pill.\nI popped it into my mouth and swallowed it dry.\nIt was hard to get down without water.\n[2 hours 30 minutes]\nHuh?\nI feel better already.\nSometimes, even when I still have time left, the effects wear off like this.\nI’ve got to stay clear-headed.\nThis makes me realize how important my health is.\nWhen things get risky, I just take more pills, and everything feels better.\nThat’s how it’s always been.\n“-I managed to reach him a few minutes ago. Han Si-Hoo said he’ll come here himself. Just wait a little longer.”\nAs I waited, I finally heard some good news.\n“Really?”\n“They’ll probably take you to a designated meeting area. I think.”\n“Ah.”\n“You seem pretty happy. You were looking gloomy earlier.”\n“Yeah. It’s been a while since we last met.”\nI didn’t realize it showed on my face how eager I was to meet the protagonist.\n“Here’s a temporary pass. Show it if anyone asks.”\n“Oh!”\nIt was a lanyard with a badge, like something a corporate worker would wear.\nAnyway, I just want to get this over with and collect the money for my meds.\n[1 hour 56 minutes]\nI’ll ask for taxi fare while I’m at it.\nEven though I brought some emergency pills, it would take too long to walk home.\nIt’s far enough to make my legs hurt.\nNot that they hurt now, but maybe that’s why the meds are wearing off faster.\nAt the academy, students get a ton of support funds.\nThey can even make money by killing monsters.\nThere are special government-led missions they can complete for cash, or they might get rare items during field practice.\nAnd let’s not forget, this is the protagonist we’re talking about.\nWho knows how much money he’s got?\nYoo Seo-Ah and Han Si-Hoo have been friends since they were little.\nHe’ll lend me some money, no problem.\nHe wouldn’t refuse, especially if it’s for my health.\nEven if the meds are expensive.\n“Haha...”\nI started laughing.\nIt feels good to laugh.\nThinking about getting money from the protagonist just makes me even happier.",

      "content": "Inside the academy, I sat across from the protagonist, Han Si-Hoo, in a small café.\nIf I had to describe him, he had black hair and was as handsome as a protagonist should be.\nThere was a reason so many heroines followed him around.\n[1 hour 45 minutes]\nI didn’t have much time left.\n“You showed up with that same smiling face.”\nHan Si-Hoo spoke with a sharp edge to his voice.\nHe seemed angry.\nFor childhood friends, we didn’t look like we had the best relationship.\n“Haha…”\nAnd that’s because we really didn’t.\nYoo Seo-Ah had purposely pushed him away.\nShe said some pretty harsh things to get rid of him.\nShe didn’t want to be a burden.\nI understand that.\nI don’t like asking people for help either.\nBut now wasn’t the time to be worrying about that.\nI needed money, even if it meant swallowing my pride.\n“...Yoo Seo-Ah. You told me to get lost, didn’t you?”\n“Uh…”\n“You said I should never come find you again, didn’t you? So why now?”\n“I’m sorry. I was wrong.”\nHow exactly did Yoo Seo-Ah push him away again?\nOh right, she cursed him out.\nShe told him to go to the academy and live well without her.\nShe pushed him away by saying all sorts of things, but it came from a mix of self-pity and inferiority.\nAfter that big fight, Han Si-Hoo didn’t come looking for her.\nAnd he didn’t reach out to mend things either.\nIn the novel, that led to Yoo Seo-Ah’s death.\nIf he had paid more attention to her strange behavior, maybe things would’ve turned out differently.\nMaybe she would’ve lived, like I am now, carefully managing her medication.\n“That time... I said some terrible things. I’m really sorry. I just couldn’t control my emotions... Could you forgive me?”\nApologizing for something I didn’t even do felt strange.\nIt almost felt like I was trampling on the part of Yoo Seo-Ah that wanted to hide her worsening condition from the protagonist.\nBut that didn’t matter.\nWhat mattered more than past mistakes was getting the meds I needed now.\n“Please? I was wrong.”\n“Hah… Fine. Let’s leave it at that.”\n“Wow, you’re forgiving me? Thank you.”\nI managed to relax my expression again.\nOf course.\nHe’s the protagonist.\nI figured he’d be willing to let it go.\nHan Si-Hoo might’ve grown up in a rough environment, which made him mature for his age, but he’s still just a middle schooler.\nHe’ll be in high school soon, but he’s still at the age where mending relationships is easier.\n“So... what’s with your arm?”\n“Huh?”\nThe bandaged arm.\nIt was clearly drawing some attention.\n“I cut myself.”\nI gave him a hollow laugh.\n“How?”\n“I just... scraped it on the edge of something. It’s no big deal, don’t worry about it.”\nThe bandages were only there to cover the wounds.\nAfter I beat the mirror to a bloody mess, the cuts had gotten worse.Thanks to the meds, though, it didn’t hurt.\nIf I had walked around with the skin exposed, it would’ve drawn even more attention.\nAt least I hadn’t broken any bones or gotten seriously hurt.\nIt really wasn’t a big deal.\n“Okay, so... did you come to the academy just to apologize, or is there something else?”\n“Haha… well…”\nIt’s harder to ask for money than I thought.\nEven with someone you’re close to.\nAnd a few minutes ago, we weren’t even on good terms.\nWe’ve only just made up.\nDid we even really make up?\nI’m banking on Han Si-Hoo being kind enough to understand.\nNormally, you wouldn’t ask for money right after apologizing.\nIf I brought it up now, it’d seem like the only reason I apologized was to borrow money.\nIt’s not a great look.\nBut it’s the truth, isn’t it?\nI apologized just to borrow money.\nWhat does honor even matter?\nBetter to lose some pride than to die.\n“So, you know the meds I take?”\n“Yeah.”\n“I’m out of money to buy more. I came to ask for a loan.”\n“What?”\n“I’ll pay you back.”\nI lowered my head as I asked.\nIf I were only asking for a small amount, I wouldn’t need to go this far, but the amount I needed was... pretty big.\nOne pill costs 70,000 won.\nA month’s supply of the injectable drug is 3 million won.\nAt first, the meds cost around 100,000 won, but the price has been going up.\nThe more people want it, the more expensive it gets.\nYoo Seo-Ah had already spent all the money she’d saved up.\nShe even sold off what little she had left.\n“So, you apologized just for this…”\n“I’m sorry.”\n“How much do you need?”\n“Around 5 million…?”\n“What?”\nHan Si-Hoo’s eyes widened at the amount.\nWas it too much?\n“Actually, 4 million? No, 3 million will be enough.”\nI should lower the amount.\nI still had some pills left, so I just needed enough to buy the solution.\n“...Are the meds really that expensive?”\n“Yeah. They’ve gotten more expensive since more people are trying to get them.”\n“There’s no way. You said it was like a cold at first.”\n[1 hour 25 minutes]\nAs we kept talking, my time was running out faster.\nI needed to get this money.\nHe’s my childhood friend, after all, right?\nHe’ll lend it to me, right?\n“I’ll definitely pay you back... Can’t you lend it to me?”\nBut could I really repay him?\nIt’s not impossible to make money, but with this body, it won’t be easy.\nTo be honest, after taking the meds, I get really lethargic.\nI feel drowsy and don’t want to move.\nGoing outside makes the meds wear off faster too.Most of my time is spent sitting quietly in the corner of my room, smiling.\nStill, I said I’d pay him back, so I’ll find a way, somehow.\nI could only hope that Han Si-Hoo would believe me.\n“I don’t get it. You’ve never had a problem paying for your meds before.”\n“The price has gone up a lot.”\n“Right…”\nHe didn’t seem to believe me.\nI mean, who would believe that the price of a 100,000 won med jumped to several million in just a few months?\nEven I wouldn’t believe it.\nBut when you think about how effective the meds are, it makes sense that they’d be that expensive.\nNo matter how bad I feel, the meds always make me feel better.\nSure, they leave me a little spacey, but I can still stay sane.\n“Well, the thing is… I’m using different meds now, too.”\nEven the injectable ones are more expensive.\n“...”\nHan Si-Hoo looked at me with a hint of disgust.\nHis gaze was filled with disappointment.\n“I really will pay you back...”\nWhat if he doesn’t lend me the money, despite our history as childhood friends?\nI might have to resort to borrowing from a loan shark, and that’s going to be a huge hassle.\nThe world isn’t exactly kind to people like me.\nRight now, the only person I can rely on is Han Si-Hoo.\n“You need 5 million won, right?”\nAfter some hesitation, Han Si-Hoo finally spoke.\n“Huh? Yeah.”\nIs he really going to lend it to me?\nHe’s the protagonist, after all.\n“I’ve transferred it to your account.”\nHe fiddled with his phone for a moment before saying that.\nI don’t have a phone, so I can’t check, but I trust that he did it.\nI guess he already knew Yoo Seo-Ah’s bank details.\n“Thanks. I’ll pay you back…”\n“I’m not lending it to you.”\n“Huh?”\n“I’m giving it to you. You don’t have to pay it back.”\n“Really?”\nWere we that close as childhood friends?\nHe’s such a protagonist.\nI almost started laughing.\n“But don’t come looking for me again. Let’s not get involved with each other anymore.”\n“Huh?”\n“Take the money and leave.”\n“...”\nIn that moment, I lost half of the few connections I had left.\nWhat did I do to make him tell me to get lost?\nIf I were in his shoes, I’d probably be just as annoyed with someone like me, groveling for money without any intention of paying it back.\nDid I really just turn our entire friendship into cash?\nThis isn’t exactly funny.\nThis isn’t how I thought things would go.\n“Why? Did hearing me say it feel different from when you told me to get lost?”\n“...”\nI guess it was a similar situation when Yoo Seo-Ah pushed him away.\nIt’s just karma.\nEven in this situation, he still gave me the money, so I guess Han Si-Hoo really is a nice guy.\n“Honestly… I’m disappointed in you. I don’t know why you need that much money, but… gambling or whatever... Anyway, let’s not see each other again. I’ll walk you to the entrance.”\nWith that, Han Si-Hoo stood up.\nHe really doesn’t believe it’s for meds.\n“Hah…”\nDespite how serious this all was, I found myself laughing.\nHan Si-Hoo looked at me with even more pity.\n[45 minutes]\nThe mental strain must’ve been too much; my time was running out fast.\nI still needed to ask for taxi money.\nBut it didn’t feel like the right time to ask for more.\n“Could you spare some cash for the ride home?”\n“I can’t withdraw the money you transferred right away... just a little?”\n“Could you hail a taxi for me?”\nI played out the options in my mind.\nNo matter what I said, it would seem pathetic.\nBut I had no choice.\n“Hey, Si-Hoo.”\nI called out to him as he walked ahead of me.\n“What?”\n“Can you lend me some money for the taxi?”\n“...Taxi money? How did you get here, then?”\n“I walked.”\n“Haha, you’re unbelievable. You’ve really gone too far.”\n“...”\nI understand.\nIf I were in his position, I wouldn’t lend me money either.\nIt sounds like just another excuse to squeeze out more cash.\n“Goodbye. Don’t come looking for me again. I mean it.”\n“Ah…”\nWith that, I was left standing alone outside the entrance.\nI handed back the temporary pass to the guard.\nHe looked at me with a smile, probably assuming everything went well.\nI stood there in a daze for a while before reality hit me.\n“How am I supposed to get home?”\nDo I have to walk?\n[31 minutes]\nIt’s not going to work.\nEven if I took public transport, I’d barely make it.\nIf I took all the pills I had on me...\nStill, walking home would take way longer than I had left.\nI thought I’d at least get enough for taxi fare.\nHan Si-Hoo was more upset than I expected.\nUnfortunately, I didn’t have enough time to calm him down.\n“If I’d known, I would’ve brought the injection with me.”\nI miscalculated a lot today.\nI’ve already used up more time than I thought.\nAnd now, I’ve got no money for the ride home.\nI can’t borrow money from anyone else either.\nIt’s not like I know anyone at the academy.\nAnd the friendly guard from earlier is nowhere to be seen.\nI’ll just have to go.\nCounting my remaining pills, I started walking home.\nAt least I’d walked this path once before, so getting back should be easy.\nBut what if I run out of time?\nI’ve got painkillers.\nI brought them just in case something like this happened.\nThey’re pretty valuable, so I didn’t want to use them easily, but I’ve got no choice.\nIn the end, only one thing matters.\nI’ve secured enough meds for the next month.\nThat fact alone makes all the other bad things seem insignificant.\nI’ve got another month to live happily.\nJust thinking about it makes me smile.\nIf only I could stay clear-headed like this forever.",

      "content": "I had officially cut ties with the protagonist.\nHalf of the few connections I had were sacrificed to get the money I needed.\nAnd then I walked all the way home.\nEvery time I felt like I was going to die, I popped another pill.\nOnce I ran out of pills, I took a painkiller instead.\n[9 hours 56 minutes]\nPainkillers lasted a lot longer than the other meds.\nEven after I got home, there was still plenty of time left.\nThe effect was strong enough that I could skip a day of injections.\nI had no idea why the painkillers were so much more effective than the regular meds.\n“My head hurts.”\nEven lying still, my head throbbed.\nMy body was exhausted.\nIt was hard to even move a finger.\nMy mind was equally tired.\nIt felt like a struggle to think.\nBut I couldn’t fall asleep.\nIt was like I had just downed a ton of coffee.\nI wanted to shut my mind off, but it wouldn’t cooperate.\n“At least you feel good, right?”\nThe doctor asked.\nHe was dressed in a black coat.\nHis face was hidden in the shadows.\n“I mean, sure, the meds help me feel good, but... why are you in my house?”\n“Well... the door was open. I assumed it was an invitation.”\n“Uh. Well, could you close it then?”\n“I already have.”\nHalf of the people I knew were in this room.\nThe doctor who sold me the meds.\nOr was he more of a pharmacist?\nAnyway.\n“Hey, doctor, since you’re here, could you give me some sleeping pills?”\n“I’m not here to sell meds today.”\n“Then why are you here?”\nIf he wasn’t here to sell meds, wasn’t he just trespassing?\nHe walked into my house so confidently, it was unnerving.\nBut I was too out of it to argue.\nBesides, if he’s a doctor, he’s probably trustworthy, right?\n“You wouldn’t be able to afford any meds anyway, would you?”\nTrue enough.\nJust yesterday, I hadn’t had a single cent to my name.\n“I’ve got money now. My friend gave it to me.”\n“A friend?”\n“Yeah, Han Si-Hoo.”\nThe doctor paused for a moment, as if in thought, before continuing.\n“I seem to remember you saying you’d never ask a friend for help. The last time Si-Hoo offered to help, you made up some excuse and pushed him away.”\n“I needed to buy meds.”\n“Still, going out of your way to ask for hundreds of thousands of won is strange.”\n“I didn’t borrow it. He gave it to me.”\nThere’s a big difference between borrowing and receiving.\nIt would’ve been awful if I had to repay the money after he cut me off.\nIn that sense, the protagonist was rather generous.\n“Gave it to you?”\n“And then cut me off. He said he never wanted to see me again.”\n“I see... interesting.”\nThe doctor seemed intrigued.\nThen he bent down, lifted me off the floor, and—\nThud.\n“Ugh.”\nHe forced me into a chair.\n“Let’s sit and have a nice, honest conversation.”\n“I just want to sleep...”\n“For your health, it’s better if you stay awake. It’s been a while since I’ve gone this far for someone.”\nHe pulled up another chair and sat down right in front of me.\nWhat’s he planning to do?\nIsn’t it bad enough that he barged into my home uninvited?\nThis was beyond rude, even for a doctor.\nBut my head hurt too much to think deeply about it.\n“You\ncannot lie\nto me. Understood?”\n“Uh, sure.”\nHis tone grew harsher for a moment.\nIt felt like I was being interrogated.\n“Where did you go today?”\n“To the academy.”\n“To meet Han Si-Hoo?”\n“Yes.”\n“Why?”\n“To borrow money.”\nWhy was he asking me the same thing over again?\nI’d already explained this.\n“Do you have no pride?”\nPride?\nAh, I guess it does hurt your pride to go crawling back to someone you’ve fought with.\nI know what he’s getting at, but...\nI don’t really care about that.\n“I needed the meds.”\n“I thought you had strong feelings for Han Si-Hoo. But now it seems that doesn’t matter anymore, does it?”\n“...Strong feelings?”\nDid he think I had a crush on the protagonist just because I’d read the novel?\nThere’s no way I’d have romantic feelings for him.\nI’m not Yoo Seo-Ah, and I don’t feel that way.\nWell, Yoo Seo-Ah did have feelings for Han Si-Hoo.\nSince I inherited most of her memories, I knew that.\nI might have felt a little of that lingering affection, but the meds cleared that right up.\n“I don’t have any feelings like that.”\n“...”\n“Why would I?”\nIt’s just common sense.\nFrom my perspective, it’s obvious.\n“Has your brain gone bad?”\n“What?”\n“Never mind.\nLet’s end this here\n.”\nNever mind?\nYou just asked if my brain’s messed up.\nDoes he think I didn’t hear him?\nEven if I’m a little out of it, I’m still thinking.\n“So, why are you here in my house at this hour?”\n“Are you really that curious?”\n“Most people would be, don’t you think?”\n“It’s a long story, but...”\nThe doctor trailed off.\nHe seemed to be deciding whether or not to explain.\n“...Well, I’ll tell you anyway. We might be seeing more of each other soon.”\n“More?“\nDoes that mean I’ll be buying meds from him regularly?\nI don’t want my health to deteriorate to the point where I need him constantly.\nThat’s terrifying.\nI can already see a future where I’m too broke to afford more than a single day’s worth of meds at a time.\n“Are you worried about seeing me often? Isn’t your plan to do whatever it takes to get the meds?”\nHe seemed a little offended.\n“It’s not like that...”\n“Really?”\n“Yes.”\n“How about this, then? If you kneel down and lick my shoes, I’ll give you a day’s supply of meds.”\n“Should I do it now?”\nHonestly, no matter what I do, I’ll feel good.\nPride doesn’t feed you.\nI don’t care if my image gets a little tarnished.\nAs long as I get the meds, I’m fine.\nOne day’s worth of meds costs over 100,000 won, so of course I’d do it.\n“No. My shoes will get dirty. Don’t do it.”\n“Oh...”\nI was rejected for a reason I didn’t expect.\nOf course, if someone offered to lick my shoes, I wouldn’t like it either.\nNot because the shoes would get dirty, but for other reasons.\nNo normal person would go around licking people’s shoes, right?\nYou wouldn’t want to associate with someone like that.\n“Well, how about this?”\n“What?”\n“I’ll give you a year’s supply of meds.”\nA year’s worth of happiness?\nIt sounds like a dream, but there’s no way that’s possible.\nI don’t have the money for that.\nIf I had known this was coming, I would’ve asked Han Si-Hoo for more.\n“I can’t afford that...”\n“In exchange, you’ll kill Han Si-Hoo.”\n“...What?”\nIt took me a second to grasp what he was saying.\n“Can you do it?”\nAnother condition I hadn’t expected.\nKilling Han Si-Hoo.\nThat’s what Yoo Seo-Ah had done when she was on the verge of death in the novel.\nSo this doctor was the one behind it.\nHe must have been the reason the protagonist had to watch Yoo Seo-Ah die right in front of him.\nHe must’ve convinced her to fight Si-Hoo with promises of meds.\nOf course, it wasn’t even a real fight.\nYoo Seo-Ah was already dying, and Han Si-Hoo couldn’t bring himself to raise a weapon against someone he knew.\nHe had no choice but to watch her fall apart in front of him.\nAfter that, Han Si-Hoo’s mental state broke down a bit.\nThe novel started with the protagonist entering the high school division of the academy.\nHe carried that tragic past with him.\nIt was part of what made him so unique.\nBut I had no intention of building up his tragic backstory.\n“Let me be clear. Yoo Seo-Ah, I want you to kill Han Si-Hoo. And, of course, the meds wouldn’t just be for a year. I’ll provide you with the highest quality meds for the rest of your life.”\n“For life?”\n“Can you do it?”\n“Hmm...”\nThere’s no way I could kill him.\nThe protagonist isn’t weak.\nDoes this guy know how many chapters are in the novel?\nThe protagonist doesn’t die.\nEven if a minor villain tries to kill him, it never works.\nI’d be lucky to avoid dying myself.\nWhat good is a lifetime supply of meds if my life is cut short?\nIsn’t there a way I could get the meds and not fight the protagonist?\n“I’ll give you time to think. I know it’s hard to focus with all the painkillers.”\n“How did you know I took painkillers?”\n“A doctor knows his patients well.”\n“Ah, right.”\n“Think carefully about whether or not you can kill Han Si-Hoo. After all, he was your only friend... though I guess he isn’t anymore.”\nThat was insulting.\nI should’ve made more friends while I could.\nThat way, I could’ve borrowed even more money.\nAs for killing Han Si-Hoo, I’d already made up my mind.\n“...Are you really going to give me the meds?”\n“A doctor doesn’t lie.”\n“For life?”\n“You’ll have an unlimited supply of the finest meds, more than you could ever need. I swear on my honor.”\nSwearing on honor to someone like me?\nHe must really value his honor.\nThat means I can trust his word.\n“Then of course I’ll...”\nOf course I’ll kill him.\nI almost said it but caught myself.\nA wise person doesn’t speak carelessly.\nOn second thought, I might be misunderstanding something.\nWould he still provide the meds while I was trying to kill Han Si-Hoo?\nOr not?\nThe doctor only mentioned that I’d get the meds after I killed him.\nHe never said he’d support me in the meantime.\nI nearly made a rash decision.\n“So...”\nJust as I was about to ask whether I’d get meds while I tried to kill Han Si-Hoo—\n“I understand. That’s enough. The fact that you’re hesitating shows you’re not completely gone yet.”\n“...”\nThe doctor cut me off, interpreting my silence as hesitation.\n“You still have some feelings left for Han Si-Hoo, don’t you? So it’s not quite an overdose yet... You’ve been pretty restrained with the meds.”\nHe picked up one of the small vials from the table and examined it.\nI wasn’t sure if he was talking to me or to himself.\nThe liquid inside sloshed as he turned it.\nRestrained?\n[8 hours 11 minutes]\nI can see the timer, so I can always take the right amount at the right time.\nI know exactly when the effects will wear off.\n“Well, anyway. I’ll lie you back down so you can rest. I’ll be seeing you again soon.”\n“What about the sleeping pills?”\nI called after the doctor as he turned to leave.\nEven if I felt good, I still wanted to sleep.\n“You won’t need them.”\n“Huh?”\nThud.\nA sudden impact hit my head.\nWeirdly enough, my eyes were closing on their own.\nAs expected of a doctor.",

      "content": "At least I didn’t have to wrap a bandage around my head.\nThanks to the doctor, I woke up to a surprisingly refreshing morning.\nI never did figure out why he showed up at my place...\nBut there’s no need to sweat the small stuff.\nJust enjoy the present—if you can.\nI inserted the needle into my arm.\nAt this point, there were so many needle marks on my arm, it was starting to get scary.\nI don’t think syringes were designed for this much use on a human body.\nBefore fear could fully take hold, I administered the medication.\n[8 hours 32 minutes]\nOf course, once the meds kicked in, all those trivial worries melted away.\nI only felt a bit dazed.\n“I’m hungry.”\nI muttered to myself, staring blankly into the air.\nIt had been a while since I last ate.\nThat’s the one downside of the meds.\nThey made me forget hunger, so I often missed meals.\nI guess it’s a little late, but it’s time to eat.\nI could cook something with the food I had in the house.\nHan Si-Hoo was probably enjoying a nice academy breakfast by now.\nThe doctor was likely dining at some fancy restaurant—he had the money for it.\nAnd...\nThere wasn’t really anyone left for Yoo Seo-Ah to compare herself to.\nListing all the characters from the novel would be endless, but one thing was for sure:\nHardly anyone was living as pitifully as I was when it came to meals.\n“Nothing left, huh.”\nI had stashed some snacks on the shelf, but they were long gone.\nI had even eaten the expired ones.\nThere’s no refrigerator here.\nNo rice cooker either.\nNo way I could cook anything.\nIronically, the protagonist, who’s always out and about, has a fully equipped kitchen in his dorm room.\nHe even has a fridge.\nAnd here I am.\nAlways cooped up at home, yet I don’t have a single cooking appliance.\nNo ingredients either.\nIs it my fault for being poor?\n“Oh, found something.”\nI spotted a can of tuna tucked away on the shelf.\nGuess I’ll be eating this today.\nI opened the can and scooped some out with a spoon.\nSure, I could go out and buy something to eat with the money Han Si-Hoo gave me,\nbut honestly, I didn’t feel like it.\nGoing out would make the meds wear off faster.\n“I’m not some stray cat, eating just a can of tuna...”\nI was still hungry.\nIf my hunger could be satisfied with just one can, I wouldn’t have felt hungry in the first place.\nShould I go out after all?\nWithdraw the money from my account, go to a convenience store or a supermarket to buy groceries...\nIt sounded exhausting.\nI’ve never really liked going out.\nMaybe Yoo Seo-Ah used to enjoy outdoor activities, but I’d rather just stay in my room these days.\nStaying still feels more satisfying.\n[8 hours 1 minute]\nI could go out since I still had meds, but something about going out like this didn’t sit right.\nI hadn’t even washed up since getting home.\nIf only Han Si-Hoo had given me some money for transportation, I might’ve stopped by the store on my way back.\nThis is all the protagonist’s fault.\nSeriously, just because his childhood friend pushed him away, he had to get all pissy.\nHe could’ve acted like a tsundere heroine or something.\nOf course, Yoo Seo-Ah’s personality was far from being a tsundere.\nI’m sure Han Si-Hoo knew that.\n“There’s not much medicine left, either.”\nI only had enough for three or four more doses.\nNot that I was worried.\nThe doctor said he’d come by soon, so I could get more meds then.\nI decided to get ready to go out and buy something to eat.\nI couldn’t starve to death, after all.\nIt felt like I was going to die, not from starvation, but from something else.\nI was curled up on the side of the road.\nThe problem started when I decided to take a look at the academy students.\nI hadn’t expected to see them so close to the slums.\nThere weren’t many people around either.\nA male and a female student, both wearing academy uniforms, were walking toward me from the other side.\nThey were probably heading somewhere to complete an academy assignment.\nJudging by their weapons, they were likely off to hunt monsters.\nCome to think of it, I had heard that a dungeon had appeared nearby. Maybe that’s what they were after?\nI slowed my pace to watch them, but the bulky male student suddenly changed direction, walking toward me.\nStartled, I tried to slip away, but it was too late.\n“Hey.”\n“Huh? Me?”\nHe was talking to me.\n“Yeah, you. You really thought we wouldn’t notice you sneaking looks at us?”\nHis tone was intimidating.\n“Huh?”\n“Don’t play dumb.”\nThud.\n“Ugh!”\nA dull thud was followed by a sharp pain in my abdomen.\nDid he just punch me?\nThe tuna I ate for breakfast felt like it was about to come back up.\nEven though I had taken meds, the pain was excruciating.\nMy legs gave out, and I collapsed onto the ground.\n“Ugh...”\nI gasped for breath.\nI almost died.\nWhat kind of person punches someone without warning?\nIs this really a country with laws?\n“Wait, was that an actual person?”\nHe had the audacity to say that after hitting me.\n“Ethan! What the hell are you doing?”\nThe girl in the academy uniform rushed over as well.\n“They told us to watch out for spies! Didn’t you say there’d be some around?”\n“That doesn’t mean you go around hitting random people! You should’ve checked first!”\n“Yeah, but I didn’t hit them that hard. They’ll be fine.”\nI heard the girl scolding him, while the guy’s voice wavered.\n“A civilian...!”\n“Who told us to watch out for human-looking spies?”\nWhile they bickered, I tried to get back up from the ground.\nThe pain wouldn’t subside.\n“Are you okay?”\n“...Haha.”\n[4 hours 32 minutes]\nThe impact had drained a significant amount of time.\n[4 hours 27 minutes]\nAnd the time was still ticking down quickly.\nThere was no way I was okay.\nDid I look okay?\n“Hey, I asked if you were—”\n“Ethan, shut up for a second.”\nSomething was wrong.\nI wasn’t feeling good anymore.\nI wasn’t happy.\nStill, I had planned for situations like this.\nThat’s why I carried emergency meds.\nIf I just reached into my pocket like this—\n“Oh... I didn’t bring any pills.”\n“What?”\nLying on the ground, I fumbled in my pocket but found nothing.\nIt hadn’t even been that long since I left the house, and I was already in a life-threatening situation.\nThis is why I hate going out.\n“Hehe, haha.”\nI laughed because of how pathetic I must’ve looked.\nHow did things get so bad?\nI still didn’t know why I got punched.\nThis is why I hate going outside.\n“Celia, I think this person’s lost it.”\n“This is all your fault! What are we going to do?”\n“I mean...”\nIn the end, I couldn’t get up.\nBut at least I learned their names:\nThe girl was Celia, and the guy was Ethan.\nThey were characters from the novel.\nBut so what?\nThat didn’t mean anything.\nI decided to just stay on the ground.\nIt felt like I had been thrown from my bed into a freezing lake.\nI wanted to get back to my bed, but that wasn’t possible.\nI needed the pills.\nAt least I could still think because I had some meds left in my system.\n[3 hours 43 minutes]\nBut even that time was quickly running out.\n“What should we do? Should we call an ambulance?”\n“Just leave them. They look like they’re from the slums anyway.”\n“What? You can’t just say—”\nThe girl’s words were interrupted by a new voice cutting into the conversation.\n“That’s enough.”\nIt was a familiar voice.\n“Who are you?”\n“I’m this girl’s guardian. As for you academy students committing assault... well. I’ll let it slide this time. Now be on your way. I’ll handle this.”\nThe doctor boldly claimed to be my guardian.\n“Oh... yes, sorry. Ethan, apologize.”\n“S-sorry.”\nCelia and Ethan quickly apologized and left.\nThey seemed relieved to dump the problem on someone else.\nNow, it was just me and the doctor left on the street.\n“...Why are you here?”\nHad he been following me?\nIn situations like this, it’s usually the protagonist who shows up to save the day, but instead, it was the doctor.\n“I was heading to your house, Yoo Seo-Ah. Didn’t I say I’d be stopping by soon? I didn’t expect to find you collapsed on the ground, though.”\n“Then... if you have some medicine, could you give me one?”\n“Here.”\nThe doctor pulled a pill from his bag and handed it to me.\nI swallowed it as soon as I got it down my throat.\nSlowly, I started to feel better.\nIt was like I hadn’t been punched at all.\n“It’s probably because it’s academy graduation season. Students are desperate to score well on their tests.”\nThe doctor explained.\n“Haha...”\nWell, that makes sense.\nWhen Yoo Seo-Ah died, it was around the time Han Si-Hoo was promoted to high school.\nThey must be taking their middle school graduation exams now.\n“Can you stand?”\n“Yes.”\nI stood up.\nThanks to the meds, I felt a little better, though my stomach was still unsettled.\n“Getting hit by a punch laced with mana... Yes, I’d say you could probably file a report with the academy for some compensation.”\n“Compensation?”\n“Though I wouldn’t recommend it. As a resident of the slums, your complaint would likely be ignored.”\n“Ah...”\nThe gap between rich and poor, the invisible class system.\nIt’s an unfair world.\nSome people are on the verge of death without their meds, while others can use violence freely.\n“Well, for now, let’s head back to your place, Yoo Seo-Ah. I picked up some food from that store on the way, so we can eat together.”\n“Wow.”\nThe doctor had never been this kind before.\nIt was odd, but if he was offering food, maybe he was a good person after all.\n“And you’ll be seeing more academy students like those two soon enough.”\n“Huh?”\n“I figured you’d want revenge.”\n“Revenge?”\n“Yes. Don’t you feel any anger? You got punched for no reason.”\nI wasn’t angry?\nHonestly, I didn’t care that much.\nBesides, I was in a good mood now because of the meds.\nWell, thinking about getting punched in the stomach... I guess I was a little angry.\nThe meds wore off quicker because of it.\n[3 hours 56 minutes]\nEven though the doctor gave me something to recover, losing so much time wasn’t ideal.\nThinking about it made me a bit mad.\n“Even if I wanted revenge... I don’t have any power. I’m not an awakened being, I’m just...”\n“If it’s power you want, I can give it to you.”\n“What?”\n“There are meds that can give you the strength of an awakened. The only downside is the high addiction risk, but with your self-control, I’m sure you’ll manage.”\n“Meds like that exist?”\nA drug that could grant the strength of an awakened.\nI’d definitely want to try it.\nI was curious what it would feel like to be as powerful as Han Si-Hoo.\n“I’ll give you some soon. Maybe you’ll even gain enough strength to rival Han Si-Hoo himself. Everyone will see how incredible you really are.”\n“Wow.”\nI didn’t fully understand what he meant, but it sounded exciting.",

      "content": "I returned home with the doctor.\nSince he said he’d bought food, I was expecting a nice meal.\nBut the doctor had laced the food with drugs.\nI noticed it while eating, but there wasn’t much I could do.\nI was hungry.\n“There’s an academy graduation ceremony in four days. You could call it a promotion ceremony for Han Si-Hoo. It’s the perfect time to make your move on the academy.”\nThe doctor spoke after we finished eating.\n“Is that so?”\n“Are you feeling more motivated now?”\n“Yeah... What was in that food? I feel weird.”\nThere was sauce on the meat, and I’m sure that’s where he slipped something in.\nIt tasted unusual.\n“It’s a drug that amplifies certain emotions. I had an awakened person who specializes in that kind of thing make it for me.”\nEmotional amplification.\nThat explains it.\nAll sorts of emotions that had been buried deep were swirling inside me.\nInferiority, fear, the desire for revenge, pain, emptiness, and more.\nYet, strangely, the desire to die wasn’t one of them.\nEven with the effects of the drugs, I could feel all these emotions.\n“Why would you give me something like that?”\n“The drugs you normally take dull your emotions.”\n“So why this?”\n“I thought it might motivate you more if you could feel your emotions more vividly.”\nMotivation?\nI could certainly feel a range of emotions.\nIt wasn’t the same as when the drugs wore off.\nI didn’t feel like dying.\nIf anything, I felt like killing someone.\n“I’m starting to feel this... urge to kill.”\n“That’s normal. This drug was originally used illegally by military organizations.”\n“Aha...?”\nSo he gave me something like that?\nFor motivation?\nI wasn’t sure what kind of motivation he was aiming for, but it had been a while since I’d experienced such a variety of emotions.\n“Now, why don’t you think about that academy boy again? How do you feel? Do you want revenge?”\n“Yeah, I want to get back at him.”\n“Good. Now, why don’t you check if there’s a bruise on your abdomen?”\nAh, from where I was punched earlier?\nI lifted my shirt to take a look.\n“Ah, I’m bruised...”\nA dark bruise had formed on my stomach.\nI guess it’s lucky my bones didn’t break.\nIt hurt just to move, but thanks to the meds, the pain wasn’t too bad.\n“If you think that bruise is bad, how do you feel about that boy now?”\n“Uh... I want to kill him.”\n“As you should.”\nI wanted to kill him.\nEven though getting bruised like that didn’t warrant killing someone,\nI felt an unnatural surge of anger.\nSomething was forcibly stimulating my brain.\n“Ugh...”\nI felt both good and bad.\nPleasure and discomfort mixed together, making my head feel like it was burning.“So, do you feel ready to kill Han Si-Hoo now?”\n“...Si-Hoo?”\nThat question again?\nIt wasn’t just a casual question anymore.\nIt felt different from the time he asked me in the middle of the night.\nSure, my thought process might be a bit off right now because of the drugs, but...\n“I asked you before, but this time I’m offering even better terms.”\n“Better terms?”\n“I’ll ensure you have access to the drugs anytime, anywhere. I’ll also provide food, shelter, and clothing. Of course, this is all contingent on you killing Han Si-Hoo.”\nDrugs, food, and shelter...\nThat was certainly a more attractive offer.\n“But...”\nI still wasn’t sure if he meant he would give me these things after I killed Han Si-Hoo or while I was trying to kill him.\n“It seems you’re still undecided, so let me help you a bit.”\n“No, wait—”\n“Do you remember what you said to Han Si-Hoo before? When you drove him away?”\n“...”\nI was about to ask a question, but he didn’t give me the chance.\nAlright, what did Yoo Seo-Ah say to Han Si-Hoo back then?\nI filtered out the stream of insults.\n‘You’re enjoying yourself now that you’ve escaped to the academy, aren’t you?’\n‘Why do you keep coming around just to mock me?’\n‘I probably would’ve lived a better life if it weren’t for you.’\n‘Must be nice to be an awakened, rising through the ranks on your own.’\n‘I don’t need your help.’\n‘Just get lost. Don’t ever show your face in front of me again.’\n...\nThat’s quite a bit.\nLook at how hard Yoo Seo-Ah worked to push him away.\nWhat was the point of doing all that?\n“I feel like crying.”\nYoo Seo-Ah’s emotions resurfaced.\nTears welled up in my eyes.\nRegret and sadness were intertwined.\nAlong with a bit of inferiority and anger.\nAfter saying all that, I still went crawling back to him for money.\nI really had some nerve.\nNow I truly understood just how much the drugs dulled my emotions.\n“Now think about how Han Si-Hoo treated you.”\nHow did the protagonist treat me?\nLet’s see...\nI remembered the conversation we had when I went to see him at the academy.\nI don’t understand. You’ve never had issues with money for meds before. You’ve really hit rock bottom, haven’t you? Let’s not have anything to do with each other anymore. I had walked for three hours just to hear that...\nThe more I thought about it, the angrier I got.\nWhy is the protagonist always so happy?\nWhy did I end up as someone like Yoo Seo-Ah, suffering so much?\nSome people struggle through life and gain nothing, while others get everything handed to them easily.\nThe world was always unfair.\nI might as well direct all my rage at the protagonist.\nHe’s benefiting from all the inequality.Han Si-Hoo can do anything because he’s the protagonist.\nI should be the protagonist of my own life, but no, it’s Han Si-Hoo.\nCouldn’t they have at least given me a better role if I couldn’t be the protagonist?\nWhy did I have to be the drug-addicted childhood friend...\nDrug-addicted?\nNo, no, that’s not right.\nThere’s no way I’d end up like that.\nI always take my meds in proper doses.\nBesides, these aren’t drugs; they’re just medicine.\nIn any case, all these problems exist because the protagonist exists.\nIt’s all for the sake of Han Si-Hoo’s tragic backstory.\nIf Han Si-Hoo didn’t exist, Yoo Seo-Ah wouldn’t be in this mess.\nReally.\nThe reason Yoo Seo-Ah started taking these meds in the first place was because of the protagonist.\nHan Si-Hoo didn’t know, of course.\n“Now that I think about it, this is all Han Si-Hoo’s fault.”\nThat’s right. It’s all the protagonist’s fault.\nWhy?\nBecause... it just is.\n“Do you want to kill him now?”\n“Yes.”\n“Good. That’s what I like to hear. Clear motivation. I wouldn’t want to make you fight without a purpose.”\n“Fight?”\n“I told you, even a regular person can become an awakened with the right drugs. All it takes is a little bit of medicine.”\n“So I’ll take the drugs and fight Han Si-Hoo?”\n“Not exactly. You just need to meet with him and have a little chat. It’s not really a fight.”\nHave a chat?\nDidn’t he say I should kill him?\nI recalled the scene from the novel where Yoo Seo-Ah and Han Si-Hoo met again.\nYoo Seo-Ah had tried to attack Han Si-Hoo with her weakened body.\nBut it wasn’t really a fight; it felt more like one-sided leniency from him.\nBut this is different from the novel.\nI’m not like the sickly Yoo Seo-Ah from the story.\nI’ve never overdosed on meds.\nMy body isn’t in bad shape.\nI’m not even in pain right now, so I’m definitely in better condition than she was.\nEven if I was angry, I wouldn’t charge at Han Si-Hoo like a maniac.\nThere’s no need to worry, right?\n“Anyway, as I mentioned, the academy’s graduation ceremony is in four days... I’ll give you the awakening drugs then. And don’t worry, you’ve already taken all the other meds you’ll need for now during our meal.”\n“Alright.”\nHonestly, I wanted to go see Han Si-Hoo right now.\nI wanted to spill out all the emotions boiling up inside me.\nThis emotional amplification drug is really something else.\n“Oh, and this. I brought more of the medication you usually take since you’re running low.”\nThe doctor pulled out a bottle filled with blue liquid from his bag.\n“A new batch of meds.”\n[37 minutes]\nI glanced at the time.\nIt was about time for my next dose.\n“...New meds?”\n“Yes. Considering you might’ve suffered internal injuries from that punch earlier, this will help speed up your recovery. It will also increase your long-term recovery rate, which will be useful for what’s to come.”\n“I see.”\n“These new meds are a bit more addictive than the ones you’ve been using, but I trust you’ll manage. The dosage is the same as before.”\n“So, how much do these cost…”\n“No need to worry about that. You’ve already agreed to kill Han Si-Hoo. That’s more than enough.”\n“Wow…”\nFree meds for life!\nBut even if I tried my hardest, there’s no way I could kill the protagonist, right?\nEven if I got angry enough to fight him, I wouldn’t really go through with it.\nAnd even if I did, I wouldn’t be able to defeat him.\nI’ve never hated anyone enough to want to sacrifice my life for revenge.\nI don’t think I ever will.\nRight?\nI shouldn’t.\nLife is precious, after all.\n“I’ll leave the food here. You can eat it when you’re hungry. I’ll come back to pick you up later. In the meantime, it would be best if you stayed home. I don’t want to find you collapsed in the street again.”\n“Yes, thank you. Goodbye.”\nI gave the doctor a small bow as he left the house.\nIt felt like I didn’t need to be that polite, but for some reason, I had no ill will toward him.\nEven though he was a shady guy who fed me strange drugs, I couldn’t bring myself to dislike him.\n[17 minutes]\n“Ah, time’s almost up.”\nI snapped out of my daze.\nI’ve been spacing out a lot lately. It seems to have become a habit.\nI reached for the new meds.\nThe blue liquid sloshed inside the bottle.\nIt felt a bit more intimidating since the liquid had color this time.\nI measured out the right dose and filled the syringe.\nWhat did he mean by \"more addictive\"?\nI guess I’ll just have to find out.\nI adjusted the syringe and stuck the needle in my arm.\n“Ugh…”\nThat familiar unpleasant sensation of the injection crept up.\n[6 hours 32 minutes]\nThe remaining time increased, but it was less than before.\nIt used to give me 8 hours; now it’s just 6.\nMaybe the drug's additional features reduced the time.\n“Hmm…”\nI started to feel better.\nIf the old meds made me feel like I was lying on a bed, this felt like I was soaking in a hot spring.\nThere’s nothing more enjoyable than this.\nI was completely satisfied.\nThe only downside was that it only lasted for about 6 hours.\n“But… is this really supposed to heal me?”\nI poked at the bruise on my stomach.\nIt didn’t hurt anymore, probably because of the meds, but it’s hard to tell if it’s actually healing.\nI’ll just have to trust it will get better.\nHmm. I suddenly feel the urge to find that academy student… Ethan, right?\nI want to find him and kill him.\nAh, my emotions are getting too intense.\nI need to be careful.\nI can’t afford to recklessly charge at the protagonist and get myself killed.\nSure, this is all Han Si-Hoo’s fault.\nIt’s the protagonist’s fault.\nBut even though Han Si-Hoo is to blame, I don’t see him as a lifelong enemy I need to eliminate.\nWouldn’t it be better if we could all just get along?\nWith those thoughts, I zoned out again, staring blankly at the ceiling.\nOn the fourth day, I had to commend myself for not overdosing on the new meds.\nThe addiction was no joke.\nI had to resist the urge to inject myself every hour.\nBut I endured.\nAs expected of me.\nThere’s no way I’d let myself get addicted to something as petty as drugs.",

      "content": "On the fourth day,\nThe doctor came into the house after the evening passed.\n\"You really have amazing self-control. I thought you would have used up all the medicine by now.\"\nThe doctor spoke with admiration.\nThe bottle still had half of the blue medicine left.\nSince I had been taking the medicine right on time, it's true I had excellent self-discipline.\n\"Well then, it’s time to congratulate you on Sihoo's graduation.\"\n\"Congratulate?\"\n\"This is a precious moment as Miss Seoa is gradually becoming an Awakener.\"\n\"Wow.\"\n[7 hours 7 minutes]\nMaybe because I had taken the medicine a little while ago, I was feeling quite good.\nIt was time to meet Han Sihoo again.\nEven after several days had passed, the anger I felt toward Han Sihoo strangely hadn’t subsided.\nProbably because I kept eating the food the doctor had left behind.\nThe doctor rummaged through his black bag and took something out.\nEvery time I think about it, black clothes and a black bag... He really seems to like matching black.\n\"By the way, doctor, why do you always wear black clothes?\"\n\"Because it makes me harder to see at night.\"\n\"Are you a criminal?\"\nNow that I think about it, he enters my house like it’s his own, without any trouble from burglars.\nA professional criminal indeed.\n\"I'm a doctor.\"\nThe doctor gave a half-hearted reply while organizing his bag.\nA black medicine bottle was placed on the table.\nOf course, it was black as well.\nI have no idea how much he likes black.\n\"This is a medicine produced using the latest magical engineering technology. It's used to awaken the qualities of an Awakener.\"\nThe doctor looked at the black glass bottle in his hand as he spoke.\nHe seemed to have great pride in the medicine.\n\"So, if anyone takes this medicine, does it make them an Awakener?\"\n\"Based on experiments so far... no. Artificially becoming an Awakener is only possible if there’s some inherent potential.\"\n\"Ah, I see.\"\n\"Miss Seoa has potential. I can roughly tell.\"\n\"How?\"\n\"Because I’m a doctor.\"\n\"I see.\"\nWhat could that potential be?\nSeeing the system status window?\n[7 hours 5 minutes]\nI could still see something right now.\nHow many people could see things like this?\nThinking like this, I guess I do have potential.\n\"This medicine was prepared specifically for you, Miss Seoa, who is overflowing with potential. We intend to use the best medicine we have.\"\n\"The best medicine?\"\n\"Yes, if you were someone unable to handle it, like someone too drug-addicted to even move properly, we wouldn’t be giving you the good stuff.\"\nIf there’s good medicine, does that mean there’s bad medicine too?\nSo even drugs have different grades.\n\"Shouldn’t the best medicine be given to those who are more sick?\"\n\"For someone who can't overcome addiction, even the best medicine would be poison. Only someone like you should receive it.\"\n\"I see.\"\nSo, someone like me needs good medicine.\nAfter all, I’m confident I’ll never get addicted to drugs.\nTo get better quickly, you need good medicine.But, come to think of it, this isn’t medicine for getting better, is it?\nIt’s for becoming an Awakener, right?\nSomething felt strange, but my mind wasn’t working well.\nI couldn’t even recall the plot of the novel clearly since taking the blue medicine.\nWell, I figured everything would work out.\nI just had to trust the doctor and follow him.\nNothing had gone wrong so far.\n\"Let me remind you once again, this is a very important matter.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"As I mentioned, the drug is quite addictive. Well, since I’ll keep providing it, there shouldn’t be any problems.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nNo need to worry.\nEven if I did worry, nothing would change anyway.\n\"So, shall we administer the injection now? Do you have any questions?\"\nThe doctor asked as he took out a sealed syringe from his bag.\n\"Hmm, what happens when the effects of the drug wear off?\"\n\"Pardon?\"\n\"If I run out of the medicine, will I go back to being a regular person?\"\n\"No. This is good medicine. You’ll just want to take more of it.\"\n\"Wow, so it’s really that good?\"\n\"Yes, it is.\"\nHas the medicine turned my brain into a field of flowers?\nNo matter what I think about, I feel happy.\nAll I see is a bright, optimistic future.\nIt feels like I’m becoming an Awakener, just like the academy students.\n\"So, will I be able to attend school like Han Sihoo?\"\n\"...First, I recommend having a deep conversation with Sihoo.\"\n\"But I’m still angry. I don’t know why...\"\n\"That's normal.\"\nThe doctor casually replied and filled the syringe with the drug.\nThe drug inside was as black as ink.\nWhat kind of drug is this, where not only the bottle but even the contents are black?\n\"Miss Seoa, you’re really kind.\"\n\"Me?\"\n\"If you weren’t so kind and naive, it would’ve been much harder for me to do this.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nSo, I’m suffering because I’m kind and naive?\nIs that the reason I started using the drug?\nCould that be true?\n[6 hours 57 minutes]\nI checked the remaining time.\nHow much will this injection extend my time?\nI hope the effects last a long time.\nI don’t want to get too many injections.\n\"Please tilt your head slightly.\"\nThud.\nThe needle pierced into my neck.\nIt was my first time getting an injection in the neck.\nSomething unusually hot flowed through my veins.\nMy vision seemed to expand.\nAll of my senses became sharper.\nThe doctor removed the needle.\n[103 hours 2 minutes]\nThe effect had greatly increased.\nI felt omnipotent.\nLike I could do anything.\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\"Ah...?\"\nI couldn’t speak properly.\n\"You seem fine.\"\n\"Heek... hee...\"\nA groan escaped me.\nIt felt like someone was stirring my brain.\nIt was a sensation I had never experienced before.\nAll my senses had amplified, transforming into pure pleasure.\nEverything I saw, heard, touched—even the smell of the air and the taste of the dust—felt new.\n\"Now, let’s go. It’s time to show Sihoo how healthy you’ve become.\"\n\"Yeeess!\"\n\"We’ll use a teleport gate to reach the academy.\"\n\"Hee...\"\n\"Even though you may not understand what I’m saying in this state, I’ll explain it to you anyway. It’s not easy to infiltrate the academy, so we had to preemptively destroy parts of it using monsters.\"\n\"Heehee.\"\n\"Planting many traitors within the academy was the key. It would be great if we could eliminate Han Sihoo, one of the world’s hopes, here today.\"\nI didn’t really care about what the doctor was saying.\nWhat I was feeling right now was simply too amazing to think about anything else.\nWhat could possibly be more important than that?\n\"Are you having fun?\"\nHaving fun?\nTo be honest, that word doesn’t even come close to describing it.\nI nodded enthusiastically in response.\n\"You’ll enjoy it even more if you fight.\"\n\"......Why?\"\n\"Everyone else did. You will too, especially after taking the military-grade stimulant.\"\nIf I could feel even better than I do now, then I should fight.\nBut who am I supposed to fight again?\n\"Remember, kill Han Sihoo.\"\n\"Yes, teacher.\"\n\"Good. I’ll open the gate.\"\nCrack!\nThe space in front of me distorted.\nA portal.\nYes, this is what they call a portal.\n\"This is a device that will instantly transport us to the academy. Please wait until it’s fully open.\"\n\"Wow...\"\nThe distortion of space felt incredible with my heightened senses.\nNo one else would have experienced something like this.\nI hoped this feeling would last a little longer.\n[100 hours]\nThankfully, I still had plenty of time left.\nIf I could be this happy in just a few minutes, what could I feel in 100 hours?\n\"The gate is ready now.\"\nThe portal had finished forming.\nIt looked just like the ones you’d see in a video game.\nSo, going inside would instantly take me somewhere else.\n\"Teleportation is a high-level technique monsters use to cross over to this world. Almost no one else can replicate it.\"\nThe doctor said this as he reached out his hand to me.\nWas I supposed to take it?\n\"Heehee.\"\nHolding his hand, I felt like I was going on a field trip like I did as a child.\nI might have been a little nervous before the injection, but now I was just enjoying myself.\nI followed the doctor into the portal.\nIt was incredibly dark.\nThen a faint light appeared again.\n\"We’ve arrived.\"\n\"Wow...\"\nIn the blink of an eye, we had arrived somewhere.\nI could see the academy buildings beyond the trees.\nWhen I looked back, the portal we had crossed through was already gone.\n\"Although the academy is built in the middle of the city, it’s surrounded by a forest and small mountains in the back. It’s designed to make it easier for students to practice.\"\nLooking around, it seemed like we were in a forest.\nNo, it was more like a flat area with a few trees planted here and there.\nWas this some sort of practice space?\nInteresting.\nBreathing in the fresh air between the trees felt...\nWait, this isn’t fresh air.\nIt tastes like smoke.\nStill, even that felt pleasant in its own way.\n\"Smoke? Fire?\"\n\"Yes, fire. We let in some fire-type monsters into the academy.\"\n\"Ah...\"\nLooking closely, I could see smoke rising from one of the buildings.\nSomething was burning.\n\"Sihoo is coming from over there.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nI turned my head in the direction the doctor was pointing.\nHan Sihoo was approaching with a sword in hand.\nWith my heightened senses, I could see him clearly even from far away, despite the darkness around us.\nWhite hair.\nSo it was true that his hair turned white when he used his power.\n\"Sihoo believes that capturing me will solve all the problems. I did lead him here intentionally, after all.\"\nThe doctor muttered as he walked forward with me in the lead.\nI didn’t know the way, but I felt full of confidence.\n\"Miss Seoa. Remember, kill Han Sihoo.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nAs Han Sihoo ran faster, it seemed he had finally noticed us.\nEven though he was still far away, I could see a few others trailing behind him, following his tracks.\nLight flickered as the protagonist’s figure came into view.\n\"You’ve got some nerve... doing this?\"\nHan Sihoo’s words were cut off as he stared at me.\nHe seemed shocked.\nOf course, he wouldn’t have expected to see me here.\nI had told him I never wanted to meet him again, yet here we were.\n\"Hello.\"\nThe doctor took the opportunity to greet him politely.\nOf course, the protagonist didn’t return the greeting.\n\"You took her as a hostage.\"\nHan Sihoo’s voice dropped.\nHe was angry.\n\"Hostage? A hostage? Of course not. Miss Seoa came here on her own.\"\nThe doctor stroked my hair gently.\nPat, pat.\n\"Heehee.\"\nOh, that feels better than I thought.\nThe enhanced sensation made the touch even more pleasurable.\nI wish he’d keep doing it.\n\"What did you do to Seoa?\"\nHan Sihoo asked, his face blank with shock.\nHe seemed deeply shaken.",

When a childhood friend suddenly starts acting strange, it's natural to think something’s wrong.\nBut I didn’t just suddenly become strange, did I?\nI’ve been like this for a long time; he just didn’t notice.\n\"I simply prescribed her the appropriate medicine.\"\n\"...Drugs, huh.\"\n\"Sometimes, when a patient’s condition is severe, you have to administer narcotics. Right, Miss Seoa?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nI am a severe case.\nWithout the drugs, I would’ve quietly died alone.\n[99 hours 45 minutes]\nThe effects of the medicine were still strong.\nI felt happy.\nIt felt like all of my senses were on fire.\nEverything in front of me looked like a fun movie, and even the air, smelling of smoke, tasted delicious.\n\"You bastard.\"\nHan Sihoo bit his lip.\nHe couldn’t attack recklessly, probably because I was here.\nIt must have been jarring for him to be in a standoff and suddenly have a hostage situation.\nThough, I’m not really a hostage.\n\"If your friend was that precious to you, you should’ve protected her better. Now you’ve learned a lesson through this experience.\"\nYeah, you should have protected me better.\n\"......\"\nHan Sihoo has this belief that he can protect everyone.\nA very protagonist-like conviction.\nBut he abandoned his childhood friend.\nWhy?\nIf he’s going to protect everyone, why did he throw away Yuseoa?\nWas it because he got tired of me?\nOr maybe he just found it too bothersome.\nI’m the only friend who remembers him from when we were kids—so why couldn’t he protect me?\n\"Oh, that’s right. You said I wasn’t even your friend anymore, didn’t you? Well, that explains it.\"\nFive million won, and we cut ties.\nSo, we’re not friends anymore.\nHan Sihoo stuck to his beliefs.\nHe really is the protagonist.\n\"Let Seoa go right now, or else—\"\n\"Haha, as you wish.\"\nThe doctor’s hand released my shoulder.\nSo what if he let go?\nThe situation didn’t change much.\nI just stood there in place, not moving.\nIt’s funny.\nDoes Han Sihoo really think I’m on his side?\nDoes he think I’m a hostage brought here by the doctor?\nThat’s ridiculous.\n\"I’d love for you two to have an honest conversation, but unfortunately, it seems like Miss Seoa is having some difficulty speaking due to the medicine.\"\nThe doctor commented.\n\"Shut up.\"\nHan Sihoo was still under the impression that the doctor had done something to me.\nDoes he think I can’t speak because of the doctor?\n\"Heh.\"\nA strange laugh escaped me.\nFor some reason, I couldn’t speak properly, as if my tongue were twisted, like when you’re drunk.\nBut if I really tried, I could probably get the words out.\n\"Seoa, come over here.\"\nHan Sihoo called to me.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Yes, Miss Seoa. You can go to Sihoo now.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nI answered and started walking toward Sihoo.\nWith every step closer, the murderous intent inside me grew.\n\"Miss Seoa, do you remember what I told you?\"\n\"Yes~\"\nThat’s right.\nIt’s all the protagonist’s fault.\nIf I kill the protagonist, I can keep getting this medicine.\nI have to kill Han Sihoo.\nI have to.\nHow?\nBy becoming an Awakener.\nBy taking the medicine.\nIt’s too late to worry about addiction now.\nIf possible, I want to live my entire life high on this drug.\nWho cares if I get labeled a drug addict?\nI don’t care what people think.\nI’m so happy.\nI want to kill Han Sihoo.\nI feel this strange sense of omnipotence.\nOf course, it’s impossible for me to actually be omnipotent, but I feel certain I can do things I never imagined before.\n\"Han Sihoo.\"\nI stopped walking for a moment and called his name.\n\"...Seoa?\"\n\"Do you like being the only protagonist, huh? Haha!\"\nI tried to suppress my laughter, but I couldn’t.\nI’m having so much fun.\nHave I ever felt this exhilarated since coming to this world?\nMy senses are so heightened that it feels like I can even read other people’s minds.\nWell, maybe not their thoughts, but I can sense their emotions.\nHan Sihoo was clearly anxious.\n\"Seoa, you’re acting strange because of the drugs. Let’s go. If we get you treated, you’ll be fine.\"\nBut I’m already getting treatment?\nAnd I’m perfectly normal.\nMore than fine—I feel amazing.\n\"...I’m completely sane.\"\nMy mind is clearer than it’s ever been.\nEverything I see, hear, and feel is sharper than ever.\nAnd all I want to do is kill the person standing in front of me, Han Sihoo.\nHe’s been irritating me for a while now.\nI feel like I can fight him.\nI can kill him.\nWould I really be stupid enough to rush at the protagonist with my life on the line?\nYou can call me a fool if you want.\nBut I’m enjoying the rush of my heart beating faster, ready for a fight.\nIt doesn’t matter if he’s an Awakener or the protagonist.\nAs long as I have this drug, I can do anything.\nCan I really kill him?\nEven though I’m under the influence, my mind is clear.\nI won’t act foolishly like the Yuseoa from the novel.\nI can fight properly.\n\"Seoa, snap out of it.\"\nHan Sihoo stood firm, holding his sword steady.\nI wish I had a weapon like that.\nA strong, cool weapon.\nWhat I admired was the protagonist who wielded a great weapon and cut down his enemies.\nNot the miserable Yuseoa.\nIt’s better to crush everything that stands in the protagonist’s way.\nI never cared for the tragic childhood friend story anyway.\nI want to be the protagonist.\nSo...\nDear drug,\nPlease grant me a sword as well.\nAnd then, a sword appeared.\nShing!\nA black sword materialized in my hand.\nOminous black energy swirled around it.\n\"What the...?\"\nHan Sihoo was shocked.\nHe must’ve been amazed to see a sword just appear in my hand.\nWould he believe me if I told him the drug gave me this sword?\n\"Black magic...?\"\nHan Sihoo muttered something under his breath.\n\"Haha, it seems like Miss Seoa wants to fight you, Sihoo. I’ll leave you two to it while I go take care of the others.\"\nThe doctor said and then disappeared somewhere.\nHe must’ve gone to deal with the academy people who were following Sihoo.\nI swung the sword created by the drug.\nThe blade blended perfectly into the dark evening landscape.\nSlash.\nI swung toward the spot where Han Sihoo had been standing a moment ago.\nWhat I ended up cutting was an unfortunate sapling.\nDid the academy staff plant it?\nIt didn’t take much effort to slice through it, which means the sword’s cutting power is amazing.\n\"Yuseoa, put that down.\"\n\"Heh.\"\nSlash.\nThis time, the sword sliced through a mound of dirt.\nI’ve never learned swordsmanship, let alone proper combat.\nAnd I lack the physical ability to wield a sword properly.\nBut it doesn’t matter.\nThe drug will solve everything.\n\"As long as I have the drug.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"It’s fine.\"\nThe black energy enveloped my body.\nThis must be what they call magic.\nThe color of magic varies from person to person.\nSince I took black medicine, black magic surrounded me.\nIt’s the basic power that all Awakeners can wield.\nThe biggest difference between regular people and Awakeners.\nEven the sword in my hand is made entirely of magic.\nWhat happens when magic covers the body?\nAccording to the novel, it enhances physical abilities.\nCrack!\nThe sword grazed the base of a tree.\nMy stance is awkward, but I’m faster now.\nI saw Han Sihoo’s face darken.\n\"Haha!\"\nThe doctor was right—fighting does make everything more fun.\nMaybe because this is a military-grade stimulant, the effects are incredible.\nThe synergy with the Awakener drug is also perfect.\nMy body craves the fight.\nClang.\nHan Sihoo blocked my sword effortlessly.\nEven though I’ve enhanced my strength with magic, I’m still being overpowered.\nIs it because he’s the protagonist?\nOr maybe because Yuseoa has no experience in fighting.\n\"Sorry, bear with me a little longer.\"\nHan Sihoo slammed the hilt of his sword into my arm.\nCrack.\n\"Huh?\"\nI heard the sound of my arm breaking.\nDid it really break?\nI dropped the sword.\nThe sword I lost flew through the air and stuck into the ground.\nThud.\nI was pushed to the ground, a small cloud of dust rising.\n\"Haa...\"\nEven falling feels good.\nThe pain was transformed into another wave of pleasure in my brain.\nI should’ve passed out when my arm broke, but I could still laugh as if nothing happened.\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\"Haha.\"\n\"I should have realized when you started acting strange.\"\n\"Hahaha.\"\nHonestly, it wouldn’t have mattered even if you had noticed back then.\nNone of it matters anymore.\nAll I can think about now is wanting more of the drug.\n[83 hours 12 minutes]\nUsing the drug’s power must have consumed a lot of time.\nIt probably didn’t help that Han Sihoo shattered my right arm.\nI’m torn.\nIf I keep fighting, the drug’s effects will wear off.\nBut if I kill Han Sihoo, I’ll have a lifetime supply of the drug.\n\"Haha, it’s not over yet.\"\nMy resolve to kill Han Sihoo reignited.\nEven if the drug’s effects diminish a bit, it doesn’t matter.\nThe joy of fighting is overwhelming.\nIt feels like fireworks are going off in my brain.\nShing!\nMagic extended from my still-functioning left hand.\nA smaller, sharper sword appeared this time.\n\"Grr!\"\nThe protagonist twisted his body to avoid the blade.\nHe was close, but he dodged my attack with no problem.\n\"So, are you going to break this arm too?\"\nI looked at my barely movable right arm as I spoke.\nIf both of my arms are unusable, I guess I’ll have to wrap bandages with my teeth.\n\"......\"\n\"No?\"\nSo, you’re not going to break it?\nWell, that’s good for me.\n\"Put the sword down.

      "content": "\"Sihoo!\"\nI turned my gaze toward the direction of the voice calling for Sihoo.\nIt was a silver-haired girl.\nHer hair gleamed even in the darkness, which spoke volumes about how remarkable her hair must be.\nShe’s still young, which probably explains her lack of sense.\nInstead of joining the attack, she just called out his name.\nIf she had ambushed me, I might have been killed on the spot.\nNo matter how heightened my senses are, my body’s physical abilities couldn’t keep up.\nUnless someone like Han Sihoo deliberately spared me…\n\"But what’s that? A monster?\"\nMonster?\n\"Is it a person? Why is the magic black?\"\nShe spoke while drawing her sword.\nJust because the magic is a bit dark, does that make me a monster?\nI understand.\nThe novel did mention that monsters have dark-colored magic.\nIt also mentioned that people strengthened with special drugs could wield black magic.\nI’m using drugs, but I’m no monster.\n\"Rena, wait for a moment.\"\n\"Huh, you’re not fighting? I came here to help.\"\n\"We’re in the middle of a conversation.\"\n\"Really?\"\nRena.\nHer full name was longer, but I couldn’t remember it.\nRena was close to Han Sihoo even before the main story started.\nShe’s like a little sister to him, a lively character.\n\"Oh, that? Got it. I’ll stay quiet.\"\nI have no idea what \"that\" is, but it seems like she decided not to interfere.\nBesides Rena, I could see more academy people approaching.\nProbably because of Han Sihoo.\nThe doctor won’t be able to hold off all the distractions.\nHe’s already let one slip by.\nI need to finish this quickly.\nIf I don’t, I’ll never be able to kill Han Sihoo.\nHe’s a monster.\nAn unkillable monster.\nHan Sihoo is a monster.\nPeople accept it because he’s the protagonist, but from anyone else’s perspective, he’s a pure monster.\nFor good people, it’s better if monsters like him don’t exist.\nKilling him from the start would be for the benefit of humanity.\nMy bloodlust flared up.\nBut to be honest, the bloodlust came first, and I added the reason afterward.\nEven without a reason, I would still want to kill Han Sihoo.\nWait, does that make me the real monster?\nWanting to kill someone for no reason?\n\"...My head hurts.\"\nMy head throbbed.\nEven that pain turned into pleasure, which was absurd.\nI have to fight and win quickly.\nI adjusted my grip on the sword in my left hand, ready to strike at Han Sihoo.\n\"Seoa.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"I’ll get you the drugs.\"\nIt was something I hadn’t expected to hear.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"I’ll find a way to get them, so let’s not fight. Put that down.\"\n\"Drugs? How?\"\nI lowered the sword to the ground.\nThere seemed to be room for negotiation.\nIf not, I had planned to try mimicking one of the protagonist's skills.\n\"I’ll find a way, somehow.\"\nCould he be serious?\nIf that’s true, half of my reason for fighting disappears.\nI still wanted to kill Han Sihoo, but this level of impulse was something I could control.\n\"Hmm.\"\nBut how would he get the drugs?\nIt’s already beyond the level of standard hospital medication.\nIt doesn’t seem possible.\nThe drugs I’m using now can only be obtained through the doctor.\nHe said he made them himself.\nBut maybe Han Sihoo could take over the doctor’s organization and steal the drugs?\nOr maybe he’ll find another way to manufacture them.\nHe’s the protagonist, after all.\nProtagonists can always achieve whatever they set their minds to.\n\"I’ll manage. Don’t you want to give me a chance to make things right?\"\nHe spoke with a determined look in his eyes.\nWhen the protagonist says something like that, it’s hard not to believe him.\n\"Make things right...\"\nWhy did I come here in the first place?\nTo get drugs.\nI came here to kill the protagonist.\nIf I can’t kill him, I won’t get the drugs anyway, so maybe it’s better to side with him?\nIn the end, justice always wins.\nAnd here, justice is the protagonist.\nBut victory itself doesn’t interest me.\nWhat matters is whether I can keep taking the drugs.\n\"We don’t need to fight. Please, put that down.\"\nWhy does he keep asking me to lower the sword?\nHe’ll block any attack I make, anyway.\n\"Are you really going to get me the drugs?\"\n\"Yes. If that’s what you want.\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nThe doctor said he’d provide me with shelter and food.\nEven if Han Sihoo brings me the drugs, it won’t change the fact that I’m completely broke.\nThe 5 million won in the bank isn’t mine.\nI have no steady income.\n[80 hours 33 minutes]\nWhat happens when I run out of time?\nI’ll just become a beggar.\n\"Then, can you give me a place to live... and food?\"\nI couldn’t help but laugh at myself for asking such a question.\nStill, I decided to rely on the kind-hearted protagonist.\n\"Of course. As much as you need.\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"I promise.\"\nI was swayed.\nAs we talked, my desire to kill Han Sihoo faded.\nWhy is it fading?\nIt must be because of the protagonist’s ability.\nHe has a passive skill that removes all sorts of debuffs.\nLater, the story brings in divine power and spirit magic.\nThe drug’s effect on my judgment seemed to lessen.\nIn fact, maybe this is the clearest I’ve been in a long time.\n[79 hours 53 minutes]\nTime was flying by.\nIt must be because I’ve been using the drug to maintain the magic sword.\nI want to enjoy the effects of the drug for as long as possible.\n\"You’ll really get me the drugs?\"\n\"I swear. So let’s go together.\"\nI was truly torn.\nIf I can’t kill the protagonist anyway, maybe I should just join his side.\n\"You... you won’t abandon me, right?\"\n\"I’ll never abandon you.\"\n\"We’re friends, right?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nThere was certainty in his voice.\nLooking at Han Sihoo, memories of the old Yuseoa came flooding back.\nBack then, whenever something went wrong, Han Sihoo would always tell me to trust him.\nAnd somehow, he always came up with a solution.\nI started feeling the same way Yuseoa had felt.\n\"I’ll trust you.\"\nThud.\nI dropped the sword I was holding.\nThe ominous black sword vanished as soon as it hit the ground.\n\"You did well.\"\n\"Haha.\"\nBeing praised felt nice.\nIt was a new feeling.\nPositive interaction with another person brought me pleasure.\n\"Now, can you get rid of that magic around you? You’ll be fine.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nI released all the magic surrounding my body.\nIt fell away like dust being brushed off.\n[79 hours 52 minutes]\nThe rate at which the drug was being consumed slowed dramatically.\nSo, I can still enjoy this feeling for about 80 more hours.\nI didn’t want to waste the drug’s effects either.\n\"I did well, right?\"\nJust as I was about to smile brightly,\nThud.\nSomething pierced through my body.\nA blade.\n\"Huh?\"\nThud. Crack.\nIt kept tearing through me.\nWhy was I stabbed?\nI thought everything was fine.\nI lost strength and collapsed.\nThud.\nMy head hit the dirt ground.\n\"As expected of Sihoo oppa. You really made her drop her guard with just words!\"\nRena, who had been standing behind me, spoke.\nI hadn’t even noticed her approaching.\nNow that I thought about it, her abilities were always hard to detect.\n\"Rena!-\"\n\"What? Wasn’t this the plan?\"\nI could hear Han Sihoo saying something, but it didn’t reach me clearly.\nI tried to open my eyes, but my vision blurred.\nI’d been betrayed.\nHe had reassured me, made me feel safe, only to stab me afterward.\nI should’ve known from the start that the promise to get me the drugs was nonsense.\nI had been fooled by the protagonist’s charm and abilities.\nDamn him.\nI should have killed him.\nIt was all a setup from the beginning.\nI walked right into an obvious trap.\n\"Heheh. Haha.\"\nLaughter bubbled up again.\nEven in this moment, I felt joy.\nThe sensation of dying was turning into another wave of overwhelming pleasure.\nMy survival instincts and the drug’s effects battled each other.\n\"Gah, cough.\"\nBlood dripped from my mouth.\nIf I could enjoy an expensive wine, would it taste like this?\nI could taste the earthy flavor of the blood.\nI never expected this to happen.\nThe drug was always right.\nBut Han Sihoo made me let my guard down and then betrayed me.\nDidn’t you say you wouldn’t abandon me?\nYou said we were friends.\nDidn’t you say it was okay?\nEven though we had broken off ties before.\nOf course, he wouldn’t keep me as a friend.\nI’m a drug addict with a broken mind.\nI wouldn’t want someone like me as a friend either.\nI get it.\nAll I do is sit around high on drugs all day, useless to anyone.\nI’ve lost the ability to live like any normal person.\nHan Sihoo must’ve seen it that way too.\nSo, I should just die.\n[56 hours 25 minutes]\nThe drug’s effect was dropping at an alarming rate.\nOf course, it was—it’s only natural when your body is bleeding out.\nThankfully, I still couldn’t feel any pain.\nDrugs are great.\n\"Ugh, cough, cough.\"\nI couldn’t even laugh anymore.\nIt was getting harder to breathe.\nHow did it end up like this?\nAs the drug’s effects faded, my usual mental state came back.\nOh drug,\nplease grant me a blade.\nA black dagger appeared in my hand.\nWho am I supposed to stab?\nThe protagonist, Han Sihoo?\nOr Rena, who stabbed me from behind?\nWho am I supposed to stab?\nWho do I need to attack?\nOf course, it’s me.\nIn the novel’s story, Yuseoa should’ve died by now.\nThis was the problem—I tried to defy the natural flow of the story.\nI was about to die, and yet, I wanted to survive.\nIt wasn’t the protagonist’s fault—it was my very existence that was wrong.\nAfter all, it’s just a story.\nOnce I close my eyes and reopen them, I’ll return to the world I came from.\nRight?\n\"Ah.\"\nI tried to stab myself in the neck with the dagger, but someone grabbed my hand.\nIf you weren’t going to finish me off, why stop me from doing it myself?\nIf you wanted to kill me, do it properly.\nWhy try to save me now?\n[22 hours 8 minutes]\nWith every second, chunks of time were being drained away.\nI formed a sharp spike with my broken right hand.\nIt didn’t need to be a blade anymore.\nI managed to bring the spike up to my throat, but my arm was grabbed again.\n\"Hah...\"\nEven now, I’m still feeling pleasure.\nWhat kind of torment will I experience when the drug finally wears off?\nNo one even brought me more of the drug.\nNot that it would’ve been enough anyway.\nI could feel the blood pouring from the wound in my abdomen.\nMy mind recognized the seriousness of the situation, but my emotions didn’t align.\nI was being consumed by an unprecedented feeling of pleasure.\nI want to die.\nSomeone’s hand kept gripping me, stopping me from moving.\nIt seemed like they were trying desperately to keep me alive.\n\"I’m sorry, cough, cough.\"\nI apologized to the person stopping me, spitting up blood.\nI must’ve done something wrong for things to end up like this.\nIt had all been wrong since I started relying on the drug to survive.\nI made some terrible mistake to end up in this situation.\nEven if I didn’t do anything wrong, I’d still beg for forgiveness.\nJust let me die.\n\"I’m sorry. I’m sorry.\"\nI mumbled between fits of coughing up blood.\nSomeone was still holding me tightly.\nVoices echoed around me.\nI couldn’t understand a single word.\n\"Please, kill me. I’m sorry.\"\nWhy are they trying to keep me alive like this?\nDo they want to toy with me, like a plaything?\nDo they enjoy watching me suffer?\n[Exhausted.]\nThere’s no more time left.\nFor real.",

This is the treatment room.”\n“Ugh.”\nI tried to speak but failed.\nSomething was stuck in my throat.\nI coughed and spat into my hand, noticing a black substance had come out.\n“Here, wipe yourself.”\nShe handed me a white handkerchief.\nWas she a healer?\nHer name tag read\nLee Yuram\n.\n“It’s a miracle you survived.”\n“Ugh…”\n“39 degrees.

I… cough, I have money.”\nIt always comes down to money.\nNo one gives medicine for free.\nAs long as I can pay for it, I’ll be fine.\n“Huh?”\n“How much…”\nI still had the money Sihoo gave me.\nI could worry about paying him back later.\nOr maybe I wouldn’t need to repay him—it was just a gift, after all.\n“The drugs you’ve been buying—how much did the doctor charge?”\n“Five million won…”\n“Oh, so that’s the going rate… I didn’t know, since the school provided this one for free… But you actually have that much money?”\n“Sihoo gave it to me.”\nHe really is my only friend.\nIs he, though?\nWe broke off our friendship, didn’t we?\nDidn’t we have a fight or something?\n“…Sihoo gave you money for drugs?”\n“Yes…”\nHe gave it to me because I needed it.\nEven though he told me never to come back.\nAt least he gave me the money.\n“Han Sihoo gave it to you?”\n“Yes.”\n“For drugs?”\nI nodded.\nMy head felt heavy.\nWhy did she keep asking the same thing?\n“What the…”\nLee Yuram held her head in her hands.\nShe closed her eyes tightly, thinking hard.\nShe looked like she was struggling to understand something.\nShe seemed really flustered.\n“Are you seriously telling me Sihoo told you to use drugs?”\n“When I asked him for money to buy the drugs… he gave it to me.”\nI couldn’t stop coughing.\nIt hurt.\n“I see… Don’t strain yourself answering.”\nTears welled up in my eyes every time I coughed.\nSomething was seriously wrong with me.\nMaybe I had a really bad cold.\n“Well, you do live in the slums… But still, why would Sihoo…”\nShe muttered to herself quietly.\nSomething about the slums.\nWas she looking down on me for living in the slums?\nI couldn’t follow the conversation.\n“So… what exactly is your relationship with Sihoo?”\nWe used to be friends.\nI tried to recall the events leading up to this.\nWhat happened before time hit zero?\n“Friends…?”\nBefore I came to the academy.\nBefore I ended up in the treatment room.\nBut why was I here?\nAt the academy?\n\"We should go congratulate him on his graduation.\"\nThe doctor had been with me.\n\"Just lift your head a little.\"\nAnd then\nthud\n.\n103 hours 2 minutes.\nAh.\nThat overwhelming happiness.\nWhere did my 103 hours of happiness go?\nWhat had I been doing?\nI had come to congratulate Sihoo on his graduation.\nI had been angry at him because he didn’t invite me, probably.\n\"Are you really going to get me the drugs?\"\n\"Can you give me a place to live and something to eat?\"\n\"Really?\"\nAll the questions I had asked in the past spun around in my head.\nI wasn’t sure what I had been asking.\nSihoo stood there, like always, telling me to trust him.\nTelling me to leave everything to him.\n\"We’re friends, right?\"\nSo, what was his answer again?\nAs the protagonist, he was always so sure of himself.\nHan Sihoo never lies.\nEspecially not to Yuseoa.\n\"No.\"\nAnd then I was stabbed.\nYes, and then I was stabbed.\nAnd stabbed again.\nMy 100 hours vanished.\nI have to stop time from disappearing.\nI have to be the one to stab myself.\nYuseoa should have died a long time ago.\nWhere did my 100 hours go?\nI feel cheated.\nI want to cry.\nI should’ve still had about 90 hours left.\nIt wouldn’t have hurt like this.\n[1 hour 45 minutes]\nI don’t have much time left.\nI could feel my heart pounding.\nMy head was burning, but I felt cold.\nMy vision was darkening.\nFever medicine.\nThe doctor had given Seoa syrup.\nIt was too sweet.\nThis time, it was so sweet I couldn’t take it.\nBut pills were too hard to swallow.\nBack then, the doctor had been kind.\n\"Seoa...\"\nSomeone called my name.\nIt was Sihoo.\nI’m sorry.

I’m really sorry.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nIt was Rena Asilia.\nShe too was still reeling from the shock of having stabbed the wrong person.\nThe problem was that she had only just learned the rules for dealing with villains.\nIn society, awakened individuals who abused their powers for evil were labeled as villains.\nOne of the methods to safely deal with such villains, without causing harm to citizens, was to take advantage of their momentary vulnerability.\nThis aligned perfectly with what Han Sihoo had done.\nHe had made the enemy lower their weapon by earning their trust!\nEven though something felt off, Rena hadn’t missed her chance to strike.\n\"I’m sorry.\"\nRena apologized to Han Sihoo again.\nShe wished she could also apologize to Yuseoa, his childhood friend.\n\"I didn’t realize she was your friend… your childhood friend.\"\n\"It’s fine.\"\nHan Sihoo replied.\n\"It’s just that… I thought you said you didn’t have any old friends.\"\nThat was Rena’s confusion.\nShe hadn’t been able to hear the conversation properly while preparing her attack.\nShe hadn’t considered the possibility of a reunion with an old friend.\nRena only knew so much about Han Sihoo.\nHe had always been reluctant to talk about his past, and since she knew he lost his parents in an accident, she had been hesitant to ask.\n-You didn’t have any friends?\n-Not even one?\nHan Sihoo hesitated for a moment, then nodded.\nThis was around the time Yuseoa had started to push him away.\nHe didn’t want the academy to know about Yuseoa.\nHan Sihoo had always found Yuseoa’s behavior—her attempts to distance herself from him—strange.\nBut if that’s what she wanted…\nAs long as she didn’t come looking for him at the academy, he thought everything would be fine.\nHe had enough to deal with at the academy, and with the semester ending soon, he had been busy.\nIf they had stayed friends, none of this would have happened.\n\"Anyway, I’m sorry. If it’s hard to talk about, you don’t have to.\"\n\"…No.\"\nRena, seeing Han Sihoo lost in thought, hesitated before quietly leaving.\n\"Sorry.\"\nShe said one last time before disappearing.\nHan Sihoo kept thinking.\nIt’s my fault.\nThe last time he saw Yuseoa at the academy, he wondered if they could ever reconcile.\nWhen Yuseoa came to see him, her arm was wrapped in bandages.\nBefore Han Sihoo had entered the academy, she had been fine.\nIt was strange to see her bandaged like that.\n-You know the medicine I’m taking?\n-I don’t have enough money to buy it anymore. I came to borrow some.\n-I’ll pay you back later.\nShe had asked for money, claiming the price of the medicine had gone up.\nIt didn’t make sense to him.\nMaybe the bandages were just for show.\nHan Sihoo knew about the medicine Yuseoa had been taking.\nIt was something she had started for a persistent cough.\nThere was no way it could be that expensive.\nHe had never seen such an expensive drug before.\nEventually, he came to a conclusion.\nShe had only approached him again because she needed money.\nHe couldn’t understand how things had gone so wrong between them.\nHe gave her the money.\nHe didn’t lend it to her.\n-But don’t come looking for me again. Let’s not get involved anymore.\n-What?\n-Eat and get lost.\n-…Okay.\nHe had thrown her own words back at her.\nHow hard was it to control his emotions?\nAt the time, he couldn’t comprehend Yuseoa’s behavior.\nNow, he finally understood.\nThe drugs.\nThe drugs had destroyed Yuseoa.\nSomeone had destroyed her with drugs.\n-Um, Sihoo.\n-Can you lend me some money for transportation?\nThe memories came back in bits and pieces.\nAt the end, she had asked to borrow money for transportation.\nIt was far from her home to the academy.\n-I walked here.\nYuseoa wasn’t the type to lie.\nNeither Han Sihoo nor Yuseoa had ever lied to each other.\nThat’s how it had always been.\nFive million won for medicine.\nYuseoa had been paying that much for drugs.\nSo how had she been managing before she came to him for help?\nThere was no way Yuseoa, who lived in the slums, could afford that kind of money.\nIf she had sold off everything she owned, she wouldn’t even have enough left for transportation.\nShe had no one to borrow money from.\nNo one to contact.\nHer only option was to rely on her only friend.\nHan Sihoo was the only one who might have helped her.\nAnd he did.\nThe last time, he had treated her similarly, frustrated after their falling out.\nHe had been deeply hurt by Yuseoa’s attempts to push him away.\nShe never apologized.\nHer reasons for needing money seemed like lies.\nHe had never been so angry at her before.\nJust this once, it seemed justified.\nThat’s what he told himself.\nYuseoa had acted as though she hated Han Sihoo more than anyone.\nYet she came back.\nHer smile when they met was disturbingly familiar.\nIt didn’t feel right.\nLooking back, it was all so strange.\n“Damn it…”\nYuseoa was smiling.\nNo, she was crying.\nBecause of him.\nHan Sihoo stood there, waiting, until someone came looking for him.\n\"...So, she was your childhood friend.\"\nLee Yuram spoke.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Well, the academy does have a habit of dragging awakened people here pretty forcefully. But still… you should’ve taken better care of her.\"\nAdmission to the academy was often partially compulsory.\nHan Sihoo hadn’t intended to leave Yuseoa behind.\nThere was a family protection system, but it didn’t apply to non-relatives.\nWith hundreds of awakened individuals gathered at the academy, it wasn’t possible to care about everyone’s personal circumstances.\nBut those who excelled always received benefits.\nHad Han Sihoo shown exceptional abilities, he could have been of more help to Yuseoa.\n\"Sihoo? Are you listening?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"You know we can’t really cure things like addiction or sickness.\"\nThey could reattach severed limbs, but they couldn’t cure a common cold.\nThat’s how it was for healing-type awakened people.\nIn certain areas, conventional medicine was still necessary.\n\"We’ve patched up the broken arm and the stab wound Rena caused. That’s not the problem.\"\nIf it was a fatal injury like a stab wound, they could heal it.\nIt was a strange system, but it was the reality.\n\"But there were some old wounds we couldn’t heal.\"\n\"Old wounds…?\"\nHan Sihoo recalled the bandages Yuseoa had wrapped around her arm.\n\"Yeah… she had bruises on her stomach too. It looked like someone had beaten her.\"\nBruises on her stomach?\nHan Sihoo’s mind conjured an image of Yuseoa being beaten.\nHad the doctor done this?\nHe didn’t know.\nHe didn’t want to imagine it.\n-Are you going to keep protecting me?\nThe image of young Yuseoa overlapped with that of the present.\nHis younger self, promising to protect her, also came to mind.\nIn the end, he hadn’t protected her.\nHe had failed.\nWhy had he done that?\nHe knew how dangerous the slums were better than anyone.\nThe academy was comfortable.\nBut did he really hate spending time with Yuseoa that much?\nWas he secretly thinking that Yuseoa was just a burden?\nWhy?\nA crushing sense of guilt engulfed Han Sihoo.\nTL NOTE\n: Please don't skimp on the stars for the translation - it inspires me and gives me the strength to write more.

      "content": "\"Anyway, as I mentioned earlier, Seo-A is in quite a state of addiction.\"\nLee Yoo-Ram said.\n\"Yes.\"\n\"She hasn't just used one type of drug, so it's a bit troublesome, but I believe that with proper care, she can recover.\"\n\"Recovery, huh?\"\n\"Recently, there's been a lot of drugs manufactured by Awakened individuals circulating, causing quite a problem. The academy has been putting measures in place. You could say Seo-A is the first beneficiary of those efforts.\"\nTo properly nurture the growing students, a lot of care is needed, even to the extent of resolving issues with drugs.\n\"That's a relief.\"\n\"She’s a childhood friend, and since you’ve been together for so long, it feels like family. You can take good care of her at the academy.\"\nFamily?\nThat’s right.\nShe’s family.\nHan Si-Hoo is aware of that fact too.\nAt the very least, he wanted to keep in touch.\nBut it’s not easy to leave the academy whenever he wants.\nHe tried sending a text. There was no response.\nHe even tried calling. She didn’t pick up at all.\nAfter being continuously rejected, Han Si-Hoo decided to give up on Yu Seo-A.\nHe hadn't completely forgotten about her.\nHe had sent a significant amount of his income from the academy to Yu Seo-A.\nHe told her to use it where needed.\nEat whatever she wanted, do whatever she wanted.\nIf she wanted, he thought she could rent a decent room to live in.\nBut it all disappeared on drug costs.\n\"...Just to reiterate, Seo-A is in a lot of pain.\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"She’s feeling a bit better now, but her fever was high, and the drug side effects seem severe...\"\nLee Yoo-Ram hesitated before continuing.\n\"If, by any chance, Seo-A tries to attack you or seems seriously frightened, you can just step back. I have tranquilizers prepared.\"\n\"Is that so?\"\nHan Si-Hoo's tone reveals his desolate feelings.\n\"Follow me for now.\"\nLee Yoo-Ram gestures for Han Si-Hoo to follow him.\nWhere they arrive is the isolation room.\n\"Okay, she’s in here... do you want to go in and see?\"\nLee Yoo-Ram stands in front of the isolation room, speaking.\nThey can't keep Seo-A here indefinitely.\nIf misunderstandings need to be cleared up, that’s Han Si-Hoo’s responsibility.\n\"Yes.\"\nIs it okay to go in?\nHan Si-Hoo hesitated briefly before grabbing the doorknob to the isolation room.\nHe needed to check on Yu Seo-A’s condition.\nClunk.\nWith a slight noise, the door opened.\nInside was a space surrounded by gray walls.\nA brown-haired girl was sitting in the corner of the room.\nShe was wearing a white patient gown.\n\"Seo-A...?\"\nHan Si-Hoo called her name.\nShe didn't respond at all until he got closer.\n\"Seo-A.\"\n\"Ah?\"\nAs he approached and spoke to her, only then did Yu Seo-A lift her head.\n\"Are you okay?\"\nYu Seo-A's complexion brightens.\n\"Si-Hoo.\"\nHer expression brightened for a brief moment.\nRight after, her face stiffens.\nHer gaze wavers.\n\"I'm... I'm sorry.\"\nYu Seo-A says this, lowering her eyes.\nShe seems to want to retreat further into the corner, even though she’s already in one.\nThey always had a kind demeanor.\nSeo-A and Si-Hoo.\nThey had a good relationship.\nSince they had a good relationship, he didn’t want to suffer anymore.\nHe hated being stabbed in the back.\nHe hated spilling blood on the dirt floor.\nHe didn't want to die.\n\"Um, I'm really sorry...\"\nHe needed to ask for forgiveness quickly.\nThis shouldn’t happen again.\n\"Uh?\"\nEven he finds it infuriating.\nAsking for drugs in the middle of a fight and trying to kill him.\nShe's an obstructive character.\nSo he understands why the protagonist would want to handle it.\nIn fact, if he were the protagonist, he would abandon Yu Seo-A.\nIt’d be better to kill someone who just hinders him.\nHe understands.\n\"I’m sorry for attacking you. It was a mistake.\"\n\"......\"\n\"It really was a mistake...\"\nHe spoke with a slightly trembling voice.\nHe hadn’t been in his right mind.\nUnder normal circumstances, he would just be resting comfortably at home.\nHe wants to go home.\nTo get the drugs and lie down comfortably until he falls asleep.\nHe doesn’t feel at ease here.\nEven though there are better beds, he feels uncomfortable.\n\"Oh, oh yeah. I haven’t spent the money you gave me yet.\"\nIt's a relief that the academy provides the drugs for free.\nHe still has some money left.\n\"I'll pay you back as soon as I get home.\"\nThe money in his bank account.\nThe money Han Si-Hoo had given him for drug costs.\nFortunately, he didn’t have to spend any money because the doctor provided the drugs for free.\nSo he hopes he can take back the money and ease the tension.\nHe wants to go back alive.\n\"Oh right, I said not to come, but I’m sorry for coming. I just... I just wanted to congratulate you on your graduation... since you’re a high school student now, so... I didn’t mean to attack you...\"\nHe babbled.\nHe has too much to apologize for.\nHe feels like he’s done too many things wrong.\nHe can’t see Han Si-Hoo’s expression.\n\"-It’s, it’s okay.\"\nWhat does that even mean?\n\"Don’t worry. I won’t do anything.\"\nHearing that made him feel a bit relieved.\nNo, actually, he’s still scared.\nHe doesn’t know what she wants.\nHis mind isn’t working well.\nWasn’t he stabbed?\nHe was indeed stabbed.\nHe barely managed to stop his breathing from quickening.\n\"I'm sorry. Please believe me. You don’t have to be scared.\"\nScared?\nNo, I’m not scared.\nI have to think that way so my hands don’t tremble.\nHe looked back up at Han Si-Hoo.\nShe looked strangely sad.\n\"The things that happened in the last battle... it was an accident. Seo-A wasn’t trying to attack you. I’m not angry at you.\"\nHe explained, trying to clarify.\nIt doesn’t seem like she’s thinking of attacking him right now.\nAt least for now, he doesn’t feel any hostility.\n\"I didn’t hurt you on purpose. It was a mistake because my comrade misunderstood, so there’s no reason to attack you.\"\nMisunderstanding.\nIt might have been like that.\nThen it’s a relief.\nNot exactly friends, but not enemies either.\nThat’s good.\n\"Last time... I was too harsh with my words. I’m really sorry. When you came looking for me, I mean, I’m just sorry. I’ll apologize.\"\nHan Si-Hoo is struggling to find words.\nHe hadn’t expected to hear an apology.\nIt seems he’s not as angry as he thought.\nHe opens his mouth slightly, only to close it repeatedly.\n\"...I promised I would always protect you.\"\nHe mumbles something.\n\"Where did it all go wrong?\"\nHe can’t tell if it’s a soliloquy or if he’s talking to him.\nThe atmosphere isn’t bright like usual.\nIt’s not like a protagonist.\n\"The fact that you ended up like this... is because I couldn’t protect you properly.\"\nIt’s too grim.\nThe protagonist shouldn’t have done anything wrong.\nYeah, the protagonist needs to stay strong.\nBecause that’s what a protagonist does.\nIf he shines, the world becomes safer.\n\"I’m fine, I am.\"\nI’m fine.\n[4 hours 20 minutes]\nAs long as there's still time left, he’s fine.\nHis fever isn’t that high.\nWas it 37.8 degrees?\nWell, it’s gone down quite a bit.\n\"I’m, I’m fine.\"\nHe’s healthy without any pain.\nHe just hasn’t gotten over his cold and is taking medicine.\nHe can live just fine on his own.\n\"I’m not hurt at all-\"\nHe choked up.\nHe swallowed again before something could escape his mouth.\nThe taste of rusty metal.\nNo, it can’t be blood.\nWhy is his condition worsening even though he’s taking medicine?\nIs he overdoing it?\n\"Seo-A?\"\nWell, he was stabbed.\nHe was stabbed.\nSo he must be bleeding.\nHe still doesn’t know.\n\"-Are you okay?\"\nHan Si-Hoo reaches out.\nWhy is he coming closer?\nIt’s too close.\nTime stops.\n\"Yikes.\"\nHe covered his stomach with his hand.\nHis body leaned slightly forward.\nBeing stabbed hurts.\nHe doesn’t want to get hit.\nIt’s not a conscious action, just a reflex.\n\"Oh.\"\nHe unintentionally became wary of Han Si-Hoo.\nLooking back, it doesn’t mean much.\nWhether he covers his abdomen or not, it wouldn’t serve as defense.\nDamn it.\nWhy is Yu Seo-A so weak?\n\"Ah...\"\nHe lowers his hand and waits for his fate.\nIs he going to get hit? Is he? Is he?\nIt’s a relief that he can’t see a knife.\nIf he gets punched, he thinks he can withstand one hit.\nHe got hit by an academy student last time.\nYeah. He can take it.\nNo.\nBut he doesn’t want to get hit.\nHe still doesn’t know why he got hit that time.\n\"No, it’s not like that.\"\nHan Si-Hoo looks flustered and steps back.\nIt doesn’t seem like he was trying to hit him.\n\"Oh, okay. I’m sorry.\"\nHe finally managed to open his mouth.\nHe’s clearly overreacting.\nIt’s just that he can’t think clearly.\nHis mind feels overheated.\nIn reality, he’s running a fever too.\n\"Even if we’re not friends anymore, Si-Hoo, I know you wouldn’t hit me, but, um, so...\"\nHe’s rambling again.\nIt seems he’s trying to say something to reassure himself.\nHas he forgotten how to speak coherently?\n\"Not friends?\"\nHan Si-Hoo asks.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"I... I thought we were still friends. If you don’t want that, I can’t help it, but I still think of you as a friend. Still.\"\n\"Oh, we’re still friends?\"\nIf he can remain friends, that would be great.\nYu Seo-A’s friend list has been resurrected.\nThat’s a relief.\n\"Yeah. Of course.\"\nHan Si-Hoo says it earnestly.\nA reaffirmation of their friendship.\nIt’s meaningful.\n\"Oh, so we’re still friends.\"\nHe feels immensely relieved.\n[2 hours 32 minutes]\nBut he doesn’t feel at ease.\nWasn’t it just 4 hours ago?\nHe needs medicine.\nHe has some leftover at home.\nIf he has that medicine, he can hold on for a while.\nIf he runs out of that too, he can just go to the doctor and buy more, right?\nBut buying medicine will probably require a lot of money.\nIf he kills Han Si-Hoo, he can get drugs for life.\nThe doctor said that.\nOh, can I kill him?\nHe quickly erased the thought that suddenly popped into his mind.\nThere’s no way he could kill him.\nWhy would he kill a friend?\nWhy would he kill someone who’s helping him?\nBut the doctor is also helping him a lot.\n\"Then, Si-Hoo.\"\n[2 hours 28 minutes]\nHe doesn’t know.\nTime is flowing too quickly.\nLet’s resolve the medicine issue first and think about it later.\n\"Can I go home now?\"\nHe needs to grab his medicine.",

I need to use my medicine.\nThe medicine the doctor gave me was more effective.\nI don't wish for much.\nJust to spend time at home and rest comfortably.\nEven lying down and staring at the ceiling would be nice.\n\"...Why?\"\nHan Si-Hoo asks back.\n\"Why do you want to go back?\"\nHis expression feels a bit dark.\nHe speaks in a subdued voice.\n\"Because it's home...?\"\nI can't stay here any longer.\nThat's just common sense.\nIt's a burden on Han Si-Hoo too.\nAs friends, it’s good to care for each other.\n[2 hours 17 minutes]\nTime is still passing at a considerable speed.\nJust being in front of the protagonist feels like a strain on my body.\n[2 hours 15 minutes]\nEverything is moving too quickly.\nIf my sense of time isn't distorted, then it really is.\nIs the medicine I was given less effective than what the doctor prescribed?\nI’m not feeling great.\n\"I need to take my medicine. I have some at home...\"\n\"It's okay.\"\nOkay?\nIt’s only okay when the medication is still effective.\nThe effect of a 100-hour medicine flickers in front of me.\nI was genuinely happy back then.\nAt least I thought so.\n\"Is it alright for me to go home?\"\nBut how do I get home?\nI don't have enough medicine to walk.\n\"You can be treated.\"\n\"Treated?\"\nThat means using the medicine to treat myself.\nIf I keep using it, my condition should improve.\nEvery time I use the medicine, I can tell I feel better.\nI want to feel good quickly.\n[2 hours 12 minutes]\nFor some reason, even though the medicine is still effective, I don’t feel good right now.\nI can’t keep living like this, can I?\nIt’s a gray area.\nI feel somewhat lucid yet also detached.\nI really should take the medicine the doctor gave me.\n\"Yeah, you can be treated.\"\n\"Then what about the medicine?\"\nI need the medicine, so why aren’t they giving it to me?\nEven if this is a narcotic, the basic purpose is treatment, so there shouldn't be a problem.\nNarcotic medication is prescribed for seriously ill patients, right?\nI can tell that my condition deteriorates every time the medicine wears off.\nThinking back, it’s chilling that I almost attacked Han Si-Hoo after taking some medicine.\nThe problem was the abuse of the drug, not the drug itself.\nRight?\nBut it was the medicine the doctor prescribed?\nI’m confused.\n\"I'm sorry.\"\nIs he apologizing for not being able to give me the medicine?\n\"If you just get home...\"\nThat's the only solution I know.\nHan Si-Hoo might not have any medicine at all.\nI should have just stayed holed up at home.\n[2 hours 1 minute]\nTime is running out.\nI habitually rummage through my pockets, but I’m in patient clothes.\nThere are no pills.\nHan Si-Hoo seems to be hesitating.\nHe looks like he's searching for words.\nWhat do I do now?\nI need to think.\nBut I can’t think straight.Maybe it’s because I haven’t taken any medicine.\n\"If I go home, the doctor will come and give me medicine...\"\nI stopped mid-sentence.\nHan Si-Hoo's expression looked strange.\nHis mood seems to darken at the mention of a doctor.\n\"...A doctor?\"\nRight, the doctor said that.\n\"What did the doctor do?\"\nHan Si-Hoo has come too close.\nHe grabbed my hand.\n\"Ah, ugh. That’s...\"\nWhy is my body still trembling?\nHonestly, even if it weren't Han Si-Hoo, I would feel this way with anyone approaching.\nI didn't know I had social anxiety.\nIs this something that happened because I didn’t take enough medicine?\n\"Did the doctor visit you at home?\"\n\"Ah, yeah.\"\nI nodded.\n\"How often did they visit?\"\n\"Occasionally.\"\nOf course, letting a stranger into my house isn’t a good idea.\nBut nothing serious happened, so it should have been okay, right?\nI had nothing valuable in my house, so there shouldn’t have been any theft or anything similar.\nThe doctor didn’t stay long at my house.\nHe just dropped off the medicine and left.\nRecently, he even brought me food.\nThere was some medicine in it, though.\n\"I'm sorry.\"\nHan Si-Hoo let go of my hand.\n[1 hour 28 minutes]\nAgain, time is slipping away quickly.\n\"The medicine must be outside. You can use it, so you don’t need to go home. Not yet.\"\n\"There's medicine?\"\nThe medicine is outside?\nThat's right.\nThis is a medical room, after all.\nNow that I think about it, Lee Yoo-Ram had given me medicine several times already.\nI feel some energy returning.\nIt’s time to get up.\n\"I want to go out.\"\nI was hiding in the corner because I didn’t have any medicine; it didn’t mean anything else.\nI just preferred the darkness.\nHan Si-Hoo no longer feels scary.\nThere’s nothing to be scared of when he’s giving me medicine, right?\nMoreover, I don’t even have social anxiety.\nI’m fine.\nThere was never really any problem from the beginning.\nCreek.\nThe door opened.\nLee Yoo-Ram approached as he saw Han Si-Hoo come out.\n\"Ah? You came out together?\"\nHe looks surprised as he sees Yu Seo-A following behind.\n\"Yes.\"\nHan Si-Hoo looks somewhat worn out.\n\"Looks like friends are indeed friends.\"\nHe observes Yu Seo-A.\nHer condition has definitely improved.\nI can see her slightly unfocused gaze.\nIt feels a bit eerie.\n\"Did you have a good conversation?\"\n\"To some extent.\"\nWas the conversation really good?\n\"Really?\"\n\"She said she wants to go home, and I think she wants to take her medicine.\"\nHan Si-Hoo said that and sat Yu Seo-A down in a chair.\nShe sat down in the chair without much resistance.\nYu Seo-A didn’t reject Han Si-Hoo strongly.\n\"What about the medicine?\"\nYu Seo-A asks Han Si-Hoo as if urging him.\n\"...Ah, I see. Just a moment.\"\nLee Yoo-Ram grabs a vial of medicine from the tray.\nHe fills a syringe with the medicine from the vial.\nYu Seo-A’s gaze is fixed on the vial.\"Alright, I’m going to roll up your sleeve.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nYu Seo-A rolls up her sleeve.\nThe wounds on her arm are revealed.\nThere are too many traces of being cut by a knife.\nThere are many marks where needles have entered and where she’s been stabbed.\nHan Si-Hoo understands now why Seo-A had bandages wrapped around her.\nThud.\nAnother needle mark was added to her arm.\n\"This should help a bit.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nWith those words, Yu Seo-A regained her smile.\nIt wasn’t the bright smile Han Si-Hoo hoped for.\nSomething fundamental seems twisted.\n\"Understand that it's hard to quit this kind of addiction cold turkey.\"\n\"What kind of injection is this?\"\n\"A tranquilizer. It has some narcotic components. You should be fine for a while.\"\nLee Yoo-Ram said as he organized the medications.\n\"But about the wounds on your arm...\"\n\"Yeah?\"\nYu Seo-A lifted her arm for Han Si-Hoo to see.\nThere were wounds from hitting glass, cuts from knives, and self-inflicted wounds.\nShe had a lot of scars.\n\"This?\"\nThe image of a broken mirror flashed back in his mind.\nAn arm soaked in blood.\n\"Ah, this?\"\nWhere did the bandages go?\nThe bandages he had wrapped carefully are gone.\n\"I didn’t want to show you this...\"\nShe said that as she lowered her sleeves.\nShe tried hard to cover her arm again, but it was too late.\nThere wasn’t really anything to call a wound or scar.\nAbout six months ago, certainly, before Han Si-Hoo entered the academy.\nHe can picture Yu Seo-A wearing short sleeves in the summer heat.\nBack then, they had fun playing together.\nThey enjoyed splashing in the puddles formed by the rain.\nNow?\nIf he had to say, it feels broken.\nHan Si-Hoo couldn’t shake that thought.\nIt was a fact.\n\"...For now, I think you need to take good care of Seo-A. She's your friend, right?\"\nLee Yoo-Ram said that as he patted Seo-A’s head.\nYu Seo-A enjoyed the gentle touch with her half-closed eyes.\n\"Yes.\"\nThis time, I’ll keep her safe without mistakes.\nI’ll go back to how it was before.\nHe answered, thinking that way.\n\"Well, it's break time now, right? There were many incidents during the graduation ceremony, and it didn’t end well... but it’s all over now. You’ll be moving up to high school too.\"\nLee Yoo-Ram said as if he was thinking about something.\nIt seemed almost like he was talking to himself.\n\"So, this is the academy’s medical room. You know it’s not a hospital, right?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"This is only available to academy students. Especially during break.\"\nLee Yoo-Ram said while touching the inspection machines and medicine vials next to him.\nThe price of each supply easily surpasses hundreds of thousands.\nIt can’t be given to just anyone.\nThe cost of the medicine alone is significant.\n\"But Seo-A isn’t... a close family member, so she’s not eligible for academy benefits...\"\nYu Seo-A isn’t an academy student.\nRealizing that, Han Si-Hoo felt a sense of despair.\nIt wouldn’t be easy to take care of Seo-A within the academy.\n\"That’s true.\"\n\"She should be hospitalized in a regular hospital, but that seems complicated, right? It’s hard to get continuous protection at a regular hospital. It’s difficult to prevent anything that happens.\"\n\"Then, if I stay by her side during the break...\"\n\"That’s a good idea, but what happens when the break is over? The treatment won’t be completed during the break.\"\nIt’s not a condition that will heal easily.\nHe knows how much medicine has been administered.\nThe scars on her arm come back to mind.\nHan Si-Hoo grinds his teeth.\n\"Then...\"\n\"I have a solution.\"\n\"A solution?\"\n\"Make Seo-A an academy student. Then she’ll be able to stay at the academy as a student, right?\"\n\"Huh?\"\nHe asks back, surprised at the thought of making Seo-A an academy student.\n\"Is that possible?\"\n\"Yeah. In fact, whether you like it or not, it’s going to happen.\"\nWhether he likes it or not?\nThat sounds strange.\n\"To enter the academy, she has to be an Awakened...\"\nAn Awakened?\nWith black mana and a black sword.\nIt seems strange to not be an Awakened.\n\"The academy has already decided to enroll her. A report has been filed stating that Seo-A was an Awakened who was captured by villains. It has been made known that you are friends.\"\nLee Yoo-Ram said with a sigh.\nThat’s how the law is set.\n\"You know? Once someone is confirmed to be an Awakened, they must be enrolled in the academy. So Seo-A will also become an academy student.\"\n\"But Seo-A was able to handle mana because of the drugs...\"\nThat’s just a guess.\nA drug that can turn anyone into an Awakened.\nIs that even possible?\n\"As far as I know, there’s no drug that can artificially create an Awakened. The higher-ups would think the same. In fact, it’s more problematic if she’s not an Awakened.\"\nLee Yoo-Ram said that as he looked at Seo-A sitting next to him.\nIs she listening to the conversation?\nYu Seo-A seems to be enjoying the drug effect with her half-closed eyes.\nShe looks like she’s about to fall asleep.\n\"Even if she is an Awakened, sending a sick girl to the academy...\"\nHe spoke while looking at Yu Seo-A.\n\"The academy knows that too. Even if she enrolls, she will be assigned to a special class. Maybe they’ll give her personal tutoring.\"\n\"Special class?\"\nThat’s something I’ve never heard of before.\n\"So, it’s because you were such an outstanding talent. Or should I say, a benefit? The higher-ups want to keep you from leaving the academy. As a condition to keep Seo-A at the academy. They hope you’ll be more compliant.\"\nLee Yoo-Ram reveals the academy's position.\nThe academy isn’t a place that’s that kind.\nThey've just discovered a means to keep Han Si-Hoo, the talent.\n\"Is that so?\"\nHan Si-Hoo nods as if he understands.\nThe academy has found a way to exploit him.\nOne of the reasons they hadn’t announced Yu Seo-A’s existence around him.\nBut since the situation has turned out this way, there’s nothing he can do.\n\"What the academy wants from Seo-A isn’t much. Even if the semester starts, there won’t be any classes. If there are, she’ll be separated from the other students and will receive classes alone. You can think of it as recuperation.\"\nStill, the specifics won’t be known until they face it.\nLee Yoo-Ram swallowed the rest of his words.\nHe hadn’t heard of a special class either; that was the same for him.\nIt’s a class hastily assembled.\nThat means Han Si-Hoo is one of the academy’s key students.\nAs long as Han Si-Hoo doesn’t lose his usefulness, Yu Seo-A will be safe.\n\"What’s a little worrisome is... you mentioned living in the slums, right? You haven’t been attending school.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nLee Yoo-Ram slightly frowned.\nHe didn’t like the thought that there were kids who hadn’t received proper education.\n\"But Seo-A knows the basics, right? No matter how safe the academy is...\"\nIf her level is too low, it could be dangerous.\nHan Si-Hoo had at least some experience in the middle school division.\nThere were no problems with adapting.\n\"I think she’ll be okay.\"\nSeo-A should be fine living at the academy.\nEven if she’s innocent, she’s not completely foolish.\nThat’s how Han Si-Hoo felt.\nAs long as she doesn’t use drugs.\n\"Well, if you say so, then that’s probably true. If she receives treatment at the academy, Seo-A will be okay.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nEverything seems to be resolving well.\nI’m glad a solution has come up.\nHan Si-Hoo no longer needs to resort to any extreme options he had in mind.\n\"Alright, then let’s take Seo-A with us.\"\n\"Wait, what?\"\n\"Are you planning to stay here? It’s way past the time to close the medical room. Even though it’s break time now.\"\nLee Yoo-Ram speaks as if he’s tired.\nHe doesn’t know how many hours of overtime he has put in.\nTeachers also need to rest during break.\n\"Now, the medicine is organized over there. You should take Seo-A to your dormitory. If anything happens, contact me immediately. I have some things to do outside, so I need to go.\"\n\"Yes...\"\nUnder normal circumstances, Yu Seo-A wouldn’t have been able to receive treatment at the academy.\nA civilian harmed by the activities of the academy?\nIgnored, dealt with, or worse.\nFrom the beginning, Han Si-Hoo was the only guardian Yu Seo-A had.\nYu Seo-A had been looking at the floor the entire time during their conversation.\nMore precisely, at the empty box that had fallen under the desk.\nThe box from which Lee Yoo-Ram took out the medicine.",

Skills or anything?\"\n\"I don’t know.\"\nI’ve asked the drugs to do something for me, but I’ve never handled mana myself.\nIt feels like some abstract concept.\nWhat exactly is mana?\nWhat are skills?\nIn the novels, it seemed like everyone could use mana, regardless of who they were.\nCould I not do it?\nI thought I couldn’t.\nI tried to feel something within my body, but I couldn’t recreate the sensations I felt when I used the medication the doctor gave me.\n\"It’s not working.\"\nNothing is coming out.\nMaybe it would be enough just to have the medicine the doctor gave me.\nThat black smoke that comes out of it.\nIt seems that would be all I need.\nOh, medicine, just do something.\nMake something happen.\nBut nothing comes out.\nI’m not going to pull a sword and rampage here.\n\"Still, it’s not working.\"\n\"I see.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nGetting into the academy is beyond my reach.\nThat’s how it is.\nHow many people want to be Awakened?\nThinking about it, having used mana even once makes me feel like a blessed being.\nHan Si-Hoo seems a bit troubled.\nIs it a problem that I’m not an Awakened?\nDid he perhaps hope that I would handle my abilities well?\nI don’t know.\n\"But still... can I get into the academy like this?\"\n\"Maybe.\"\nThat’s a strange thing.\nIt seems like I’m not an Awakened.\n\"That’s amazing.\"\nYeah, being at the academy when I’m not even an Awakened.\nIf I use the medicine given by the doctor, I can at least mimic an Awakened.\nBut the medicine provided by the academy wouldn’t suffice.\n\"When does the academy start?\"\n\"There’s a high school entrance ceremony in a month. Until then, you’ll be in this dormitory.\"\n\"Ah, I see.\"\n\"I think you’ll be assigned to a new dormitory before the entrance ceremony. Let’s stay together until then.\"\nDespite the walk to the dormitory, the oddly awkward atmosphere remained.\nWe weren’t particularly distant, yet the proximity felt too close.\nThere have been too many strange things happening.\nI’m not sure if “strange” can encompass everything.\nWhile thinking about various things, we arrived at the dormitory building.\nBuilding A, 3rd floor.\nRoom 308.\nThis dormitory looks almost like a hotel.\nBuilding A is assigned to the academy’s top students.\n\"This is my room.\"\nHan Si-Hoo's dormitory was clean from the entrance.\nJust as I had imagined.\nI hadn’t thought I would be here.\n\"...Wow.\"\nIt’s definitely much better than home.\nThe dormitory feels like a place where people actually live.\nIt’s at least of hotel quality.\nIt truly is a national elite training ground.\n\"You can sleep here. I’ll be in the living room right next door.\"\nThere’s a room with a bed.\nAnd a television.\nIt feels like a real hotel.\nHan Si-Hoo’s personal belongings are hardly visible.\nJust a few school uniforms hanging on the wall.\n\"If you want to shower, you can do that here. As for clothes... they’re mine but unworn, so you can wear anything from that closet.\"\nIt’s the closet inside the bathroom.\nThere are white shirts and black shorts inside, wrapped in plastic.\nThey seem to be standard issue clothing provided by the academy.\nThey definitely look brand new.\nThey’re a bit big, but they look alright.\n\"The towels are over there, and if anything happens, just call me.\"\nI should probably wash up.\n\"Okay. Thanks.\"\nThe bathroom has a separate shower area.\nNot bad.\nA shower, huh.\nIt’s been a while.\nWater pours down from above.\nIt’s warm.\nThe reflection in the mirror shows the same old self.\nI’ve seen it so many times that it’s lost its impact.\nWhy are there so many scars?\nThe bruises look bad.\nThis is why I need to take my medication properly.\nI feel a bit miserable, like a wet dog.\nWell, if we’re just talking about the basics of living, I might be similar to a stray dog.\nAs long as I have the medicine, it doesn’t matter.\nThere are too many needle marks on my arm.\nI want to smash the mirror, but I held back.\nAfter changing into the clothes, I didn’t look too bad.\nThe short-sleeved shirt revealed my scars quite a bit.\nI guess I don’t need to hide them even at home.\nAfter all, Han Si-Hoo knows everything.\n\"Si-Hoo?\"\n\"Yeah?\"\nHan Si-Hoo was organizing the medicine in the living room.\n\"Do you have any bandages?\"\nMy arm is likely to attract attention.\nI don’t want that.\n\"No. I’ll buy some along with clothes tomorrow. If you need anything, just tell me.\"\n\"No, thanks.\"\nIt’s too late to go out now.\nIt’s 3 AM.\n[6 hours 23 minutes]\nThe effects of the medicine are just enough for me to fall asleep.\nI hope I can use it just once more.\nSo my wounds can heal quickly.\n\"Can I use the medicine?\"\n\"You just used it 30 minutes ago...\"\n\"It’s necessary for the wounds to heal.\"\n\"Wounds?\"\n\"Yeah. These.\"\nI lifted my shirt.\nI showed the bruise on my abdomen.\nPerhaps because I used the medicine, the wounds were fainter than before.\n\"Ah.\"\nHan Si-Hoo turned his eyes away.\nWhy is he so flustered?\nI’m just showing him my injuries.\nDoesn’t he want to check my wounds?\n...Indeed.\nI was slow to realize it.\nWell, I would also be taken aback if a girl lifted her shirt in front of me.\nEspecially since I’m not wearing a top.\nIs this really just a friendship?\nIt could be, I guess.\nOut of consideration for Han Si-Hoo, I lowered my shirt again.\nI didn’t really think much of it.\n\"Ah, anyway, it’s too early right now.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n[6 hours 22 minutes]\nThis should be fine for now.\nI’m not feeling too bad either.\nLate at night.\nEarly morning, maybe.\nI try to forget the sticky past.\nI think I can sleep now.\nI sat on the edge of the bed.\n\"Can I watch that?\"\nI pointed at the television.\n\"Watch as much as you want.\"\nHan Si-Hoo brought over the remote and showed me how to use it.\nIt’s a television I’m familiar with.\nI can also watch videos produced directly by the academy.\nThere are introduction videos about the academy and even movies.\n[6 hours 21 minutes]\nTime began to melt away.\nIt’s fun to watch after a long time.\nEven the advertisement videos are entertaining.\nThere’s an advertisement selling medicine at a cheap price.\nIt’s not the medicine I use.\nI can’t fall asleep.\n[2 hours 18 minutes]\nSo I’m still staring at the screen now.\nThe television.\nIt would be nice to have one at home.\nNo, would it even be possible?\nBecause of the unstable power supply, it was hard to use my phone.\nEventually, I ran out of money and sold everything.\n\"...It’s off.\"\nThe screen was dark.\nWas it a dream?\nDid I fall asleep?\n[2 hours 17 minutes]\n\"Medicine...\"\nI feel sorry for waking Si-Hoo.\nHe must be sleeping in the living room.\nDuring the rest, it seems my fever has gone down completely.\nI didn’t lie down on the bed.\nI sat on the floor and leaned against the bed, watching television until I fell asleep.\nBut for some reason, I’m on the bed now.\nDid Si-Hoo move me, or did I climb up?\nI don’t know.\nI look at the clock hanging on the wall; it’s 7 AM.\nIt’s morning.\n\"Si-Hoo?\"\nThe door is slightly open.\nWhen I go out to the living room, I see Han Si-Hoo sleeping against the wall.\nIsn’t it uncomfortable?\nHe must have had a tough time.\nYesterday was exhausting in many ways.\nI caused too much trouble.\nI can’t see the medicine bottles or syringes.\nI have an idea of where they are, but I’m not sure.\nI need to wake Si-Hoo to use them.\n\"...Si-Hoo?\"\nI called his name softly.\nHe doesn’t wake up.\nHe must be very tired.\nIt’s not urgent for me to use the medicine, so it’s okay.\nI laid him down on the floor and propped him up with a pillow.\nI covered him with a blanket.\nHe doesn’t wake up.\nI watched him sleep for a moment.\nIt’s a leisurely morning.\nHere, there’s an air purifier, air conditioning, and a heater.\nThe environment is so nice that it’s surprising.\nThis must be the academy dormitory.\nI think I was supposed to become an academy student.\nI pulled a chair out and sat at the table.\nThere’s a refrigerator too.\nCan I open it?\nI’m not hungry yet since I haven’t fully woken up.\nKnock, knock.\nI hear a knocking sound on the door.\nI wonder if it’s just my imagination and strain my ears to listen.\nKnock, knock.\nIt feels like someone is quietly tapping on the door.\nIt seems like they’re being considerate not to wake the person inside.\nSi-Hoo hasn’t woken up.\nKnock, knock, knock.\nIt’s definitely a person.\nI stood up from my seat to open the door.\nIt seems like a package has arrived.\nWhat about my outfit?\nThere’s no problem at all.\nThe clothes are a bit big, but that’s okay.\nIf I keep my scars out of sight behind my back, they won’t be visible.\n\"Yes.\"\nI’m coming out.\nI said it too quietly.\nNo one would hear even if I tried to say I’m leaving.\nI’m being careful not to wake Si-Hoo.\nClick.\nWith the sound of the doorknob turning, sunlight streams in.\nStanding at the door is a girl with long black hair tied in a braid.\nShe’s wearing a school uniform, so she must be an academy student.\nThere are two scabbards hanging from her back.\n\"Si, Si-Hoo. This is a thank you gift...\"\nShe pauses, startled upon seeing me.\nShe takes a step back to check the dormitory number.\n\"...Huh?\"\nShe looks like there are five question marks floating above her head.\nShe’s holding a white paper bag in her hand.\nIt seems to be a gift for Si-Hoo.",

You haven’t been able to receive calls.\"\n\"Phone?\"\nHer tone seems slightly resentful as she mentions that I haven’t been receiving calls.\nBut was there a way to receive calls?\nIf I had a way to communicate, I wouldn’t have had to go through all this trouble just to see Si-Hoo.\n\"Did I have one? A phone? For me?\"\nI think I did.\nIt seems I couldn’t use it well because charging was difficult.\n\"What?\"\n\"Ah, yeah. I think I sold it. Yeah.\"\nHer tone sounds scary.\nPlease don’t get angry.\n[6 hours 12 minutes]\nWhen I’m scared, time flies quickly.\nThis is not good.\nI have memories of Yu Seo-A communicating with Si-Hoo over the phone.\nIt seems I sold it because I needed money.\nBut I should have kept the phone until the very end.\nWell, I was short on money.\n\"I see.\"\nHan Si-Hoo’s expression darkens.\nIs he upset that I sold the phone he bought for me?\n\"Anyway, can I go out?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"I want to go home.\"\nI need to go get my medicine.\nThe medicine I’m using now has effects, but it doesn’t feel as good as the one the doctor gave me.\nI want to bring back the medicine I left at home.\nEven though I received it for free from the doctor, it’s expensive, so it would be a shame to just throw it away.\n\"...Why do you want to go home?\"\nAm I not allowed to go home?\nIt’s my house.\nEven if I’m a student at the academy, going out should be somewhat free, right?\n\"Uh, I have some medicine I used to take.\"\n\"Medicine?\"\n\"Yeah.

If I did, I would have died a long time ago; there wouldn’t be any left at home.\"\nThis means there's no need to place the medicine somewhere high.\nEven if it’s right in front of me, I know how to use it well.\nThe doctor was surprised that I had medicine left.\nI have decent self-control when it comes to that.\nIf I didn’t, I would have already been at a funeral by now.\n\"So please bring it. Okay?\"\nI keep trying to persuade him.\nNo matter how I think about it, the more medicine I have, the better.\nIf I were to run out of medicine and not be able to use any, it would be a big problem.\n\"I'm completely fine right now. I can just sit here by myself.\"\nI added more words because he seemed worried.\nWhat I’m using now is the medicine provided at the academy.\nIt should have passed sufficient safety tests.\nI wonder where it’s sold.\n\"I haven’t used any dangerous drugs.\"\nWhat would count as a dangerous drug?\nA drug that would make me want to kill Han Si-Hoo?\nA drug that would cause me to get killed by the protagonist.\nOf course, even if such a drug existed, it had the advantage of letting me feel emotions vividly.\nBut it’s still too risky to use.\nI don’t even know how it relates to my treatment.\nIt was indeed a strange drug.\nAt that time, I couldn’t control my body.\nI could barely control my thoughts.\nIt’s clear from how I hated Han Si-Hoo for no reason.\nI never expected I would attack him.\nNow that I’m not using such dangerous drugs, there shouldn’t be a problem.\nAnd I don’t plan to use them in the future.\n\"...Okay. I’ll go home and check.\"\nHan Si-Hoo agreed.\n\"Wow.\"\nI’m looking forward to it.\nHe really will bring it.\n\"I have to check anyway...\"\nHan Si-Hoo murmured.\nI don’t know what the check is, but I’m sure he’ll do it well.\nAs long as he brings me the medicine, the rest doesn’t matter.\n\"But before that...\"\nHan Si-Hoo continued.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Aren’t you hungry?\"\n\"A bit.\"\nOne of the advantages of using the medicine is that I don’t feel too hungry.\nStill, if I skip meals too often, my body will lack strength.\nI need to eat something.\nNow that I think about it, I haven’t eaten anything properly since yesterday.\nIf I’m not hungry, that’s even stranger.\n\"I’ll make you breakfast.\"\nHan Si-Hoo said confidently.\nIt seems like he wants to lighten the atmosphere.\nHe clears the paper bag from the table and takes out some dishes.\n\"Breakfast?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nDoes Han Si-Hoo cook well?\nThere hasn’t been any mention of his cooking skills in the story.\nI thought he always just went out to eat.\n\"...It’s good.\"\nTo sum it up, it was better than I expected.\nI enjoyed the fried rice Han Si-Hoo prepared.\nIs it because he’s the protagonist? He cooks well too.It’s definitely better than the canned tuna I had at home.\n[5 hours 8 minutes]\nI have confidence that anything will taste good while the medicine is still effective.\nWell, it was delicious.\nHe didn’t just add the medicine like the doctor would.\n\"Are you okay?\"\nHan Si-Hoo asks from the side.\n\"Yeah.\"\nI’m smiling, aren’t I?\nOf course, I’m fine.\nDoes my pensive look seem strange to him?\nI think this peaceful everyday life is nice.\nIf only Han Si-Hoo would bring me the medicine, it would be perfect.\n\"Here you go.\"\nI accepted what Han Si-Hoo handed me.\n\"A phone?\"\n\"It’s something similar. Just call the stored numbers if something happens, or press this button.\"\nI know what this is.\nIf you’re an academy student, you have to have one.\nWhen I went to find Han Si-Hoo at the academy, I could have contacted him through this device.\n\"Uh-huh.\"\nI fiddled with the device I received.\nIt doesn’t seem very different from a basic smartphone, but I know it has various added functions.\nHan Si-Hoo had his phone separately from this device.\nIt’s amazing that he can give me one of these.\n\"Don’t go outside until I get back.\"\nHe said firmly.\n\"The academy is probably safe, but you never know. For safety's sake.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nI wasn’t planning to go out anyway.\nIf I do, the effects of the medicine will probably wear off even more.\n\"I’ll leave one syringe behind. Use it if you need it, and contact me in case of an emergency.\"\nI don’t know how many syringes are supposed to be used in a day.\nHaving an extra won’t hurt.\n\"Okay. Come back safely.\"\nI saw him off.\nHan Si-Hoo stepped out of the dormitory, having seen Seo-A off.\nIt seemed that Seo-A’s condition had improved.\nHe hadn’t expected Yeon-Hwa to come by.\nThanks to her visit, he realized Seo-A was capable of interacting with people to some extent.\nShe had said she received a gift, that she had received it on his behalf.\nIt’s not a special relationship or anything.\nHe couldn’t fathom what Seo-A was thinking.\nA strange sense of guilt pricked at his heart.\nHe recalled Seo-A saying he had many close friends.\nLeaving Seo-A behind weighed on his mind, but he needed to confirm something.\nIf he could bring the medicine Seo-A used to Lee Yoo-Ram, he might find out what kind of medication it was.\nPerhaps he could also gain useful information for her treatment.\nAs Han Si-Hoo walked, various thoughts crossed his mind.\nThe air was still cold.\nHe could see people working to repair the academy due to yesterday’s attack.\n\"Is that barrier still under repair?\"\n\"Yeah. It’s taking time to clean up the monster corpses.\"\n\"An academy attack? What in the world...\"\nHe overheard the conversations of the people around him.\nDue to the massive outburst of monsters, the academy buildings were heavily damaged.\nAccording to the whispers, there was a traitor from within.\nHan Si-Hoo recalled the figure of the doctor dressed in black.\nHe also remembered Seo-A standing with the doctor.\nA strange anger bubbled up within him, causing him to bite his lip.\nHan Si-Hoo contemplated the reasons why the doctor had made Seo-A fight against him.\nHe had barely slept last night due to worry.\nIn the end, no conclusion came to him.\nThere was too little information.\nWould there be any clues if he went to Seo-A’s house?\nPerhaps he could find out what had happened with the doctor.\nIt had been quite some time since he had last visited.\n\"I found it.\"\nSeo-A’s neighborhood was quiet.\nIt was cleaner than one would expect from a slum.\nEven if it was clean, it was still shabby.\nIt was so rundown that he questioned if it really was her house.\nFor some reason, it looked worse than before.\nSeo-A usually took good care of her living space.\nShe was a kid who liked to clean whenever she had the chance.\nCreak.\nThe door was ajar.\nIt seemed they hadn’t locked it from the start.\n\"Ah...\"\nThe inside of the house was quite messy.\nBroken glass shards scattered about.\nSomething was smeared across the walls and floors.\nHan Si-Hoo carefully pushed the shards aside with his shoe.\nThe state of the house was more serious than he had anticipated.\nIf Seo-A were the person he remembered, she would never leave the house in this state.\nEverything was different from the last time he visited.\nHe pressed the switch to turn on the lights, but all he heard was a spark.\n\"The lights are broken too.\"\nA few hypotheses came to mind.\nPerhaps a thief had broken in while Seo-A was away.\nOr maybe she hadn’t maintained the house for an extended period.\nHan Si-Hoo scanned the table.\n\"There’s a bottle with medicine in it... here.\"\nIt was a bottle with blue medicine inside.\nAt least it seemed that no one had come into the house and taken the medicine.\nIf he were to simply grab what Seo-A needed and leave, he could easily do that, but the house was too messy for that.\nHe needed to find out what had happened.\nA number of terrible scenes came to mind just thinking about it.\nWhat had happened to Seo-A?\nThud.\nHe righted a fallen chair.\nThe more he looked around the house, the more anxious he became.\nThe only thing that looked organized was the medicine.\n\"Is that a box?\"\nHan Si-Hoo discovered a white box under the desk.\nIt was a plastic box meant for medical supplies.\nInside were multiple syringes and disinfectants.\nA piece of paper at the bottom of the box contained instructions on how to use the syringes.\nAside from that, there was nothing of importance.\nHan Si-Hoo closed the box.\nNow it was time to search the next room.\nCreek.\nThe creaking of the hinges sounded particularly loud.\nThe doorknob of the room was broken.\n\"Ugh.\"\nInside the room, there were piles of scrap metal that looked like they were picked up nearby.\nA few rebar pieces, a heap of rusty chains, and some rope.\n\"Why are these in the house?\"\nHe couldn’t grasp what Seo-A had used these for.\nPerhaps it wasn’t Seo-A who had used them.\nLet’s assume it wasn’t her.\nWhat had they been used for?\nHe remembered Seo-A saying the doctor had come to her house.\nIf that were the case, did the doctor leave these things behind?\nHan Si-Hoo felt a headache coming on.\nSomething was terribly wrong.\n\"...A mirror?\"\nIt reflected light from the stained floor.\nFollowing the trace, he reached a cracked mirror in the bathroom.\nNext to the broken mirror were faint bloodstains.\n\"Why?\"\nHan Si-Hoo muttered while looking at the blood smeared on the wall.\nWhat had happened?\nThe cracked mirror had a piece of the edge missing.\nHan Si-Hoo took a long time to process what he was seeing.\nEven after seeing it with his eyes, he didn’t understand what had happened.\nWhat had Seo-A done?\nOr what had been done to her?\nIt was cut.\nWhy?\nJust scratched on the corner. It’s nothing to worry about.\nThe conversation he had shared with Seo-A came back to him.\nIt had been cut, scratched on the corner.\nBecause of the mirror?\nWhy?\nBecause of the medicine?\nIt’s hard to imagine Seo-A, who always smiled, shattering a mirror by her own choice.\nWas it the doctor’s doing?\nOr was it a side effect of the medicine?\nThere were dozens of possibilities.\nThe most certain thing would be to go ask Seo-A herself.\n\"...Hah.\"\nThis is more serious than I thought.\nSomething has gone terribly wrong.\nWhat was Han Si-Hoo doing all this time?\nHe had been enjoying life at the academy.\nEnjoying.\nSeo-A had been without protection.\nWhy hadn’t he properly taken care of her?\nHe couldn’t understand why he thought everything would be fine.\nOf course, it was true that Seo-A had pushed him away with hatred.\nRegardless of whether Seo-A refused him, he should have confirmed her situation somehow.\nHan Si-Hoo looked at his reflection in the broken mirror.\nHe looked troubled.\nHe should have thought more about it.\nHe shouldn’t have let it slide, thinking Seo-A would be fine with minimal support.\n\"Damn it.\"\nHe looked around the house a few more times, but no matter how he looked, it was not a place someone could live.\nIn particular, the scrap metal piled up in the room made no sense at all.\nThe Seo-A he remembered always kept her house tidy.\nIt had given off a cozy and clean impression.\nThe contrast between the cold present and the cozy past was immense.\n\"Why...\"\nSeo-A hadn’t mentioned the state of her house.\nShe had asked him to bring her medicine as if there was no problem at all.\nAs if she were completely unaware of the condition of her home.\nFrom any angle, this place looks like a mess.\nIt’s hard to believe it’s where a person lives.\nHan Si-Hoo examined the medicine bottle on the table.\nAbout half of the blue medicine remained in it.\nThe other half was the amount Seo-A had used.\nHe had never intended to take this medicine back to Seo-A as is.\nFirst, he needed to hand it over to Lee Yoo-Ram or someone else who could help analyze it.\nHis eyes fell on a drawer under the table.\nClick.\nHe opened the drawer.\nInside were a broken hair tie and a black ribbon.\nThis was definitely the ribbon Han Si-Hoo had given Seo-A when she was about ten years old.\nAs he recalled that fact, he took the ribbon with him.\nA gift.\nIs it a gift?\nSeo-A had folded a paper crane for him in return for the ribbon.\nThere had been a torn origami book found in the trash.\nUnfortunately, an important page was ripped out, resulting in a paper crane that didn’t look like one.\nBut it had been a decent gift.\nClick.\nHe opened the adjacent drawer as well.\nThis time, there was a small notebook inside.\nHan Si-Hoo opened the notebook.\nIt was filled with Seo-A's notes.",

      "content": "The first page of the notebook was filled with writing practice.\nIt had been written with a ballpoint pen, probably picked up from somewhere.\nAwkwardly scribbled, meaningless sentences.\nHan Si-hoo\nYoo Seo-ah\nThe corner of the notebook had names written in it.\nThere were also some doodles that were impossible to decipher.\nAs Han Si-hoo turned the pages, he began to see sentences with more meaning.\nIt rained today.\nIt rained yesterday.\nIt rained the day before.\n\"A diary...\"\nHan Si-hoo had seen Yoo Seo-ah occasionally writing something in the notebook.\nShe never wrote anything lengthy.\nThere was never a surplus of pens or paper.\nShe had never let him see the contents, so he couldn't confirm what she wrote.\nWe played hide-and-seek today.\nIt was fun.\nA sketch, assumed to be of Han Si-hoo and Yoo Seo-ah, was drawn in the corner.\nHe flipped another page.\nI like Si-hoo.\nI'm happy because of Si-hoo.\nThe words were written in a shaky handwriting.\nHan Si-hoo hesitated to turn the page.\nWould Seo-ah say the same thing now?\nDoes she still think fondly of him?\nIs she still happy because of him?\n...Probably not.\nWould Han Si-hoo even be part of what makes Yoo Seo-ah happy now?\nEven without him, she would be happy if she had her drugs.\nPerhaps that’s why she attacked him.\nFeeling heavy-hearted, he turned another page.\nStrange doodles filled three pages.\nSentences about the weather stretched on for a long time.\nHe kept flipping through the pages.\nHe hoped there might be something useful.\nIf Yoo Seo-ah had been using the notebook recently, maybe he could learn something.\nWhen did she start using drugs?\nHow did their home end up like this?\nHan Si-hoo wanted to know.\nWith each page he turned, her handwriting became neater.\nThere were also long periods where it seemed she hadn't written anything at all.\nThe diary was stuck in the drawer.\nIt seemed like she had lost and then found it again.\nIf she had been writing in it since she was young, it made sense that she would run out of space.\nHe turned more pages.\nI wish I could be as strong as Si-hoo.\nThe words expressed a sense of lamentation.\nYoo Seo-ah had always watched Han Si-hoo train alone.\nIt wasn’t easy for her to keep up, even when she tried.\nSi-hoo will protect me, so it’s okay.\nThat was true.\n\"......\"\nBut Han Si-hoo hadn’t been able to protect Yoo Seo-ah.\nSo it wasn’t okay at all.\nHis hands started trembling slightly.\nHe turned the page.\nI bought cold medicine.\nFinally, something related to medicine.\nI need to get better quickly.\nI had saved that money to buy a present for Si-hoo.\nHe remembered Yoo Seo-ah once bought a snack worth 1500 won and gave it to him as a gift.\nShe had said she wished she could have given him something better.\nWas this diary entry from around that time?\nHe wasn’t sure.\nI didn’t cough at all today.\nIt’s thanks to the new medicine.\nThe new doctor seems nice too.\nThere was a mention of the doctor.\nA new doctor, apparently.\nThe details weren’t clear, but it seemed certain that she had gotten the medicine from the doctor.\nI almost got caught with the syringe by Si-hoo.\nI forgot to clean up.\nHis head started feeling fuzzy.\nA syringe?\nWhen had she written that?\nHe hadn’t noticed at all.\nIt had been going on since before he entered the Academy.\nSomething felt wrong.\nThe doctor had been involved before he even left for the Academy.\nHe couldn’t figure out why.\nTomorrow, Si-hoo goes to the Academy.\nI wish I could go too.\nThe two sentences were written with a small gap between them.\nWhen it became known that Han Si-hoo was an Awakened, the Academy and the government enrolled him immediately.\nThere wasn’t even an option to refuse.\nThere were benefits to going.\nHe met many people.\nMost importantly, he made a lot of money.\nMoney that he could give to Yoo Seo-ah.\nAnd all of it went toward her medicine.\nI wish I could go to school with Si-hoo.\nI wish I were an Awakened.\nI’m bored.\nVarious wishes were listed.\nI want to play with Si-hoo.\nThis was written in small letters.\nHe turned the page.\nNow that Si-hoo is gone, I have to do well on my own.\nWhy did they take Si-hoo?\nI’m alone.\nI shouldn’t cry.\nYoo Seo-ah’s loneliness was evident in her writing.\nAn entire page was filled with her expressing how much she missed Han Si-hoo.\nTaking the medicine makes me feel okay.\nThe doctor said I could take a little more.\nThere were entries about gradually increasing the dosage.\nI stayed home today.\nI decided to stay home again today.\nYoo Seo-ah hadn’t liked staying inside.\nThe Yoo Seo-ah in Han Si-hoo’s memories was always active and loved to play outside.\nBut without Han Si-hoo, there was no one to play with.\nNo friends, either.\nOn the margins of the page, her wishes were written.\nThe sky is clear.\nI want to watch the stars with Si-hoo.\nWatching the stars...\nSi-hoo, do you want to go watch the stars tonight?\nIn the past, at home.\nYoo Seo-ah had asked that one day.\nIt had been about a week since Han Si-hoo entered the Academy.\nHe had visited Yoo Seo-ah briefly when she shyly asked him to stay with her.\nNo?\nOh, you probably have plans tonight. With a friend...\nIt’s fine, forget I said anything.\nHan Si-hoo had refused her.\nHe really did have plans.\nHe never thought that the always-smiling Yoo Seo-ah could feel loneliness.\nThough she seemed disappointed, he had thought he would take her out another time.\n\"Ah.\"\nThinking about the past made him feel like he was going to die.\nThat was the last time Yoo Seo-ah had asked him to stay.After that, she started distancing herself from him.\nHe turned another page.\nI got money from Si-hoo for the medicine.\nI bought a month’s worth.\nOf course, she had never mentioned it was for medicine.\nBut Yoo Seo-ah had used all of Han Si-hoo’s money for it.\nBut the price of the medicine went up again.\nI shouldn’t be a burden.\nSi-hoo might worry.\nI can’t let that happen.\nWith trembling hands, Han Si-hoo turned the page.\nYoo Seo-ah had been worried about him.\nShe hadn’t wanted to be a burden.\nShe had known she was becoming dependent on the drugs.\nThat’s why she had pushed him away.\nSi-hoo waited outside the door, but I told him not to come back. I think I was too harsh.\nThe writing looked shaky.\nI’ll apologize later.\nOnce I no longer need the medicine, I’ll go find him.\nI don’t want him to see me like this.\nHe’ll forgive me.\nThe handwriting fluctuated between thick and thin.\nIn some places, she had pressed the pen so hard that the paper had torn.\nOnce she didn’t need the medicine anymore.\nYoo Seo-ah had intended to find Han Si-hoo again only after she no longer needed his help.\nBut in the end, she had come back.\nShe had come back to ask for money for the drugs.\nIt seemed like she no longer cared about looking desperate.\nShe had failed to quit the drugs.\nSorry.\nI shouldn’t be living like this.\nShe was apologizing to someone.\nThe rest of the sentences on the page were crossed out repeatedly with a pen, making them unreadable.\nI’ll manage somehow.\nSeveral pages had been ripped out.\nEven if I’m gone, Si-hoo will be fine.\nOr not?\nI hope not.\nWill he be fine?\nThe same sentence was repeated over and over.\nIt would be good if he’s fine.\nSorry.\nApologies filled the page.\nThe medicine is weird.\nSi-hoo isn’t coming.\nLines had been scratched across the sentences.\nYoo Seo-ah knew better than anyone that Han Si-hoo wasn’t coming to help her.\nBut she had no one else to turn to.\nShe had no friends.\nOf course, he isn’t coming.\nWill he accept my apology later?\nI was too harsh.\nThe pen marks were erratic.\nFrom here, the notebook’s lines no longer mattered.\nThe sentences were scrawled haphazardly across the page.\nI threw away all the medicine.\nI can handle the pain.\n\"...What?\"\nYoo Seo-ah had thrown the medicine away?\nThrown it away?\nIt won’t hurt much.\nOnce I’m better, I can go to Si-hoo, right?\nThere were signs that Yoo Seo-ah had resolved to stop taking the medicine.\nIt seemed like she desperately wanted to meet Han Si-hoo again.\nAnd then, blank space.\nBlank pages stretched on for a long time.\nNear the back of the notebook, words began to appear again.\nI’m happy because the sky is clear today.\nIt was the last sentence that Han Si-hoo could clearly understand.\nThe weather is clear.\nThe weather is clear.\nThe weather is clear.\nThe weather is\nThe rest of the page was filled with doodles or illegible scribbles.\nHe stared blankly at Yoo Seo-ah’s diary.\nThud.\nAfter a long time, he closed the notebook.\nHis hands were trembling uncontrollably.\n\"Ugh.\"\nNow he knew for certain that Yoo Seo-ah had distanced herself because she was worried about him.\nLoneliness and suffering had driven her further into dependency on the drugs.\nAt some point, she had started getting her medication from the doctor.\nHe had seen the words\n\"It doesn’t hurt when I take the medicine\"\nrepeated dozens of times.\nHe should have known sooner.\nHad he really been that indifferent to her?\nThat couldn’t be it.\nBut it was too late now.\nHis vision kept blurring.\nHe felt like throwing up.\n\"Why?\"\nWhy had it come to this?\nWhy?\nWho had caused this situation?\nHis stomach churned.\nYoo Seo-ah had been a sweet and bright childhood friend.\nThe Yoo Seo-ah in the diary had been calling out for Han Si-hoo’s help.\nBut he hadn’t heard her cries.\nAnd, of course, there had been no help.\nHe didn’t want to think anymore.\nBut he had to.\n\"Why...\"\nWhy had this happened?\nHe asked himself the same question over and over.\nHe grabbed his head.\nHan Si-hoo desperately tried to find a reason.\nOut of all the people, why had this happened to Seo-ah?\nWhy had the doctor prescribed the medicine?\nHe didn’t know.\nAll that was left was the fact that he hadn’t been able to protect Yoo Seo-ah.\nThere must be something more, right?\nThere had to be more information in this house.\nRattle.\nThe drawer of the desk was pulled open with a rough sound.\nInside was a broken tricolor pen.\nThat was all he could find in the drawer.\nStaggering, he stood up.\nHe grabbed the notebook.\nThe pile of junk in the room remained a mystery.\nThe reason for the shattered mirror was still unknown.\nHe didn’t know exactly when she had started using injections.\n\"...I have to go back.\"\nHe had to return to the dorm and ask Seo-ah about all of this.\nDid he really think that a casual breakfast together would resolve everything?\nCould they just pretend nothing had happened and talk like normal?\nCould a few apologies make everything disappear?\nWould things go back to peaceful normalcy with a little effort?\nWould it all be over with some rest and treatment?\nWhat would Seo-ah think?\nHan Si-hoo asked himself.\nHe just wanted to run away.\nInstinctively, he was rejecting the harsh reality.\nBut he knew he had to stop avoiding it.\n\"I have to go back.\"\nHe needed to find out what had really happened.\nBut he had no clear idea.\nOr perhaps too many.\nToo many possible things could have happened to Seo-ah.\nThe range of bad outcomes kept widening.\nHe considered the worst-case scenarios.\nBut there were so many that it was meaningless.",

Just give it to me.\"\nHe understood the concern.\nHan Si-hoo didn’t know what was in the medicine.\nBut that was true for the syringe from the Academy, too.\nThe one from the doctor worked better.\nSo, of course, he should use the one from the doctor.\n\"I’m sorry. But I know it’s dangerous for you, and since it’s from that doctor, I can’t give it to you. It’s too risky.\"\nRisky.\nNot using the medicine was the riskiest thing.\nWhy bring it if he wasn’t going to give it to him?\nHad he even brought it at all?\nHan Si-hoo hadn’t shown it yet.\n\"Then, is this safe?\"\nHe held up the syringe Han Si-hoo had given him.\nThe Academy’s medicine.\nIt didn’t work well and didn’t last long.\nThis was the weird medicine.\n1 hour and 53 minutes.\nEven though the effects were still working, he felt awful.\nHe was afraid he might snap at Han Si-hoo.\n\"It’s safe.\"\nHan Si-hoo said, but he didn’t look entirely confident.\nHe wanted to ask what made it safe.\nIf he questioned it, he might get angry.\n\"Ah, okay.\"\n\"I’m sorry.\"\n\"You... Yeah. I get it. What makes you trust the Academy so much? I don’t like the Academy...\"\nHe was rambling.\n\"If I don’t have the medicine, I won’t heal, and if I don’t heal, what’s the point? Do you want me to keep suffering? Why...\"\nStop saying weird things.\nHe couldn’t control it.\nThe anger itself was the problem.\nHe needed to use the medicine.\nThud.\nThe automatic syringe was convenient.\nAll he had to do was press it.\n6 hours and 33 minutes.\nThe anger subsided.\nThe negative emotions faded.\nMedicine is medicine.\n\"Ah, sorry. I said some weird things... Thanks for going all the way home.\"\nHe didn’t forget to thank him.\nNow that he thought about it, he had been a bit rude.\nThe first thing he did when Han Si-hoo arrived was demand the medicine.\n\"It’s fine. You don’t need to apologize.\"\nHan Si-hoo looked like he had lost a lot of confidence.\nSomething about him felt off.\nHe seemed even more down than before.\n\"Sorry, just leave the medicine to you. I wasn’t thinking clearly because I hadn’t used it yet. Don’t worry about it.\"\nHe decided to leave it to Han Si-hoo.\nNow that he had used the Academy’s medicine, it wasn’t so bad.\nHe should’ve used it before things got out of hand.\nHe didn’t know why he hesitated.\n\"Hey, Seo-ah.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"The Academy contacted me, and they said they can keep supplying the medicine you’re using now.\"\n\"Ah.\"\n\"So... let’s save the other medicine for when it’s really necessary.\"\n\"Okay. Sure.\"\nThat was fine.\nThough he wasn’t sure when \"necessary\" would be.\nHow would he explain when he truly needed it?\n\"And about the medicine I brought...\"\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"No, never mind. I’ll tell you later.\"\nLater?\nIt didn’t seem like it was anything important.\n\"Why do you look so down? It’s not because of something I said, is it?\"\nSitting on the bed, he asked.\nHe felt uneasy.\nHe couldn’t quite remember what he had said before using the medicine.\n\"No. That’s not it.\"\nSomething definitely felt off.\nEven with his dulled emotions, he could tell that much.\nHan Si-hoo clearly wasn’t in a good mood.\n\"I just... want to ask you something, Seo-ah.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"I want to hear about what’s happened to you so far.\"\nHan Si-hoo was about to ask a question.\nAbout what had happened to him until now.\nThere had been a lot.\n\"Mhm.\"\nHe wasn’t sure if he could answer everything, but he was curious about what Han Si-hoo wanted to ask.\n\"...About.\"\nHan Si-hoo hesitated for a long time before speaking.\nWhat was he trying to say?\n\"I went to your house earlier... Why was it in that state?\"\n\"What?\"\nThe state of the house?\nWas there a problem?\n\"It was a mess.\"\n\"Really?\"\nA mess?\nWas his house that dirty?\nIt was in the slums.\nHe didn’t expect much.\nHe had been content with it.\nAs long as he had medicine in his sights, that was enough.\n\"There was broken glass on the floor, and the mirror too...\"\n\"That... Yeah?\"\nNow that he thought about it, something had been scattered near the entrance.\nThe bottle holding his pills had broken.\nHe vaguely remembered half-cleaning it up.\nThe mirror had been broken too.\nHad he done that?\n\"Maybe.\"\nThinking back, the house had been pretty dirty.\n\"And the piles of scrap in the room? Chains and all?\"\n\"Scrap, chains? Oh, that...\"\nHe really should have cleaned up.\nHe had left everything in place out of laziness.\nIf only Han Si-hoo had just taken the medicine from the living room and not explored the rest of the house.\n\"You picked all that up from around the area? Why were you keeping it in your house?\"\n\"That’s...\"\nHe had, in fact, picked those things up.\nBack when he didn’t fully understand how good the medicine was.\nHad he thrown it all away?\nIt didn’t make sense now.\n\"I don’t remember.\"\nLet’s go with that.\nIt was too much effort to explain.\nCould he tell it was a lie?\nHe had refused to take the medicine at the time.\nHow long could he last without it?\nIn hindsight, it had been incredibly foolish, but at the time, he had believed it was the right thing to do.\n\"Is it that hard to explain?\"\n\"......\"\nIt was hard.\nHe didn’t even know where to begin.\nSaying he didn’t remember was partly an excuse but also somewhat true.\n\"I mean, it’s just...\"\nIt wasn’t much.\nHe had used the things he picked up to block the door and test how long he could last without medicine.\nThe plan had been to extend that time gradually.\n[-1 minute]\nWhen the number dropped below zero, the will to live disappeared.\nHe didn’t want to think about it too much.\n6 hours and 26 minutes.\nWhat would he do if he started feeling awful again?\nIf Han Si-hoo didn’t have enough medicine, that would be a problem.\nThat’s when he would really need the doctor’s medicine.\nActually, maybe that wasn’t a bad idea.\nHmm?\nMaybe he should just use it all up.\nThere was no point in saving it.\nDon’t hold back.\nUse the medicine while it’s still there.\nHow strange it was to suddenly feel like he wanted to die.\nLiving happily and peacefully forever would be much better.\nBack to the point.\nAnyway, he needed to explain things to Han Si-hoo.\n\"That... well, how should I put it...\"\nHow could he sum it up?\nHan Si-hoo seemed curious, so it was only right to give him an answer.\nIt was because he hadn’t taken his medicine.\nHis mental state had been a little off.\nLooking back now, it seemed ridiculous.\nWhy had he refused to take the medicine?\nThe doctor had said it was good for him.\nYou could only be considered sane if you took the medicine, yet he had thought he was fine.\nHe just hadn’t wanted to admit that he was sick.\nSick people take medicine, and that’s okay.\n\"If you don’t want to talk about it, that’s okay.\"\nHan Si-hoo seemed even more dejected.\n\"...Yeah, sorry.\"\nHe had tried to explain, but his thoughts had wandered too much.\nThat was one of the few downsides of the medicine—getting lost in thought.\n\"It’s okay.\"\nIf Han Si-hoo said it was fine without an explanation, there was no need to push it.\n\"Do you have anything else to ask?\"\nHe could answer other questions to some degree.\nProbably.\nHan Si-hoo hesitated.\nIt seemed like he had something he wanted to say.\n\"...I’ll ask later.\"\n\"Later?\"\n\"Yeah. Later.\"\nThat was fine with him.\n\"I don’t know everything that’s happened to you, but when you’re ready to talk, let me know.\"\n\"I will.\"\n\"Even if something bad happened to you... I won’t let anything like that happen again.\"\n\"Uh, okay.\"\nNothing bad had really happened to him.\nWho would’ve done something to him?\nHe had never let bad people into his house.\nHan Si-hoo must have misunderstood because the house had been a mess.\nIt sounded like Han Si-hoo was saying he would protect him.\nThat was a good thing, right?\n\"I’ll trust you.\"\nHe smiled as he said that.\nYoo Seo-ah was best at smiling, after all.\nHe must’ve smiled well.\nBut could he really trust him?\nThere was no way a bad person would give him medicine.\nAt first, when he had been stabbed, he thought Han Si-hoo hated him.\nBut judging by his attitude now, that didn’t seem to be the case.\nHan Si-hoo still treated Yoo Seo-ah like his childhood friend.\nRight?\nHe resisted the urge to check for the scar on his stomach.\nHe had been stabbed there before.\nNo, it’s fine. They’re friends.\nIt’s peaceful.\nGood.\nThis was more comfortable than being at home.\nWith Han Si-hoo around, it felt safer.\nSo, what if he used the better medicine now?\nLike the one the doctor gave him.\nYes.\nA slight smile tugged at the corner of his mouth.",

      "content": "Brown hair. Eyes tinged with a slight red hue.\nYoo Seo-ah sat on the bed, swinging her legs back and forth.\nShe looked happy.\nHan Si-hoo had returned to the dormitory, but she didn’t seem to notice.\nAs he debated whether to greet her, Yoo Seo-ah spoke.\n\"Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad to die.\"\nShe was still smiling faintly.\nIt sounded like a casual comment, and her expression didn’t change.\n\"...Si-hoo?\"\nShe noticed him.\nHan Si-hoo wondered if he had heard wrong.\nIt wasn’t the television.\nHe needed to tell her she couldn’t die.\nI’m sorry, please kill me.\nIt was a bad memory.\nHe felt his mind start to fog, but he pulled himself together.\n\"Welcome back.\"\nThe conversation with Seo-ah had ended.\nIt had been decided that Han Si-hoo would keep the medicine he brought from home.\nHe could forcefully take or restrict the medicine if needed.\nSince he had control of the medicine, Yoo Seo-ah would have no choice but to listen to him.\nBut that didn’t seem right.\nIt would make him no different from the doctor.\nThere were many questions to ask.\nToo many, but he couldn’t bring himself to voice them.\nHe was afraid of what might come out of Yoo Seo-ah’s mouth.\nHe wondered if she was even aware of the state of her house.\nWhen he first mentioned the broken glass, she hadn’t immediately realized it.\nIn Han Si-hoo’s mind, thoughts of all the bad things that might have happened to Seo-ah swirled.\nHe couldn’t stop them, no matter how hard he tried.\nThe wrecked house, the scars on her body, the drug addiction.\nCould it have been... ■■ or something like ■■■?\nNo, surely not.\nBut the worst-case scenarios came rushing in faster.\nHan Si-hoo hoped it was all just his imagination.\nHe walked into the living room, feeling parched and poured himself a glass of water.\nSeo-ah was staring blankly at the television again.\nSince using the medicine earlier, she hadn’t asked for more.\nShe seemed to have some level of self-control.\nThough he wasn’t sure if injecting herself several times a day could really be called restraint.\nIt seemed she had her own limits.\nHan Si-hoo hated himself for letting Seo-ah end up like this.\nHe also hated the other factors that had caused it.\nThat doctor, or whoever he was.\nHe had to be dealt with.\nHan Si-hoo would handle it personally.\nLast time, he hadn’t been able to act because Seo-ah was there, but next time, he would confront him properly.\nHe couldn’t let Seo-ah be taken hostage again.\n\"But why Seo-ah, of all people?\"\nNo matter how much he thought about it, he couldn’t figure out the doctor’s motive.\nThe doctor could have killed Seo-ah right in front of Han Si-hoo if he wanted to.\nKnowing that had made Han Si-hoo cautious in his actions.\nThe doctor had let Han Si-hoo rescue Seo-ah, almost as if his goal was to get her addicted to the drugs.\nAs if to taunt him, saying,\nWhat were you doing while your childhood friend was suffering?\nIt was an act of extreme cruelty.\nSo Han Si-hoo knew what he had to do.\nHe needed information.\nHe should start by investigating the medicine he brought.\nHe had already taken a sample and given it to Yoo Ram.\nAll he had to do now was wait for a response.\n...But it was too quiet.\nHad there ever been a time when things were this quiet with Seo-ah around?\nShe sat still, staring at the screen, faintly smiling.\nHan Si-hoo couldn’t tell if her eyes were focused on anything.\nMaybe it would be better to talk.\nWhat did they used to talk about?\nAs he sat at his desk, lost in thought,\nBuzz.\nHis phone vibrated.\n[\nLena:\nSi-hoo?]\n[\nLena:\nWhat happened?]\n[\nLena:\nAre you okay?]\nThe one who had accidentally attacked Seo-ah.\nLena was probably struggling with her own guilt.\nStabbing a civilian was weighing heavily on her.\n\"Hah.\"\nHe wasn’t okay.\nBut he couldn’t blame Lena.\nShe had just followed the basics of handling a threat.\n[\nI’m fine.\n]\nThey both went to the Academy. It was likely she would meet Seo-ah again.\nHe could already predict how Seo-ah might react.\n\"...Damn it.\"\nSeo-ah flinched at his words, startled.\nShe must have thought it was directed at her, and she lowered the volume on the television.\n\"...Sorry. Did I disturb you?\"\n\"Huh? No, it’s not about you, don’t worry. I’ve never thought of you as a disturbance. Just relax.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nShe cautiously turned the volume back up.\nEven though Han Si-hoo wanted her to be comfortable, she couldn’t seem to fully relax.\nWhat should he do?\nHow could he fix his relationship with Seo-ah?\nThey had been best friends, but even if that bond was broken beyond repair, at least he could try to restore her to normal.\nBuzz.\nHis phone vibrated again.\n[\nYeon-hwa:\nThanks again for helping me back then.]\n[\nYeon-hwa:\nDid you get the gift I left?]\nAh, the gift.\nThe paper bag was still unopened.\nHe had saved Yeon-hwa during the last city dungeon incident.\nIt wasn’t strange to receive a thank-you gift, but he felt self-conscious with Seo-ah nearby.\n[\nYeon-hwa:\nSome girl accepted it on your behalf. Who was she?]\nIt was hard to explain.\n[\nShe’s a friend.\n]\nHe opened the gift bag.\nA few simple snacks.\n[\nThanks for the gift. I appreciate it.\n]\nThat was enough.\n\"Oh.\"\nHe suddenly remembered he had something for Seo-ah.\nA ribbon he had found at home.\nHe had brought it without much thought, but now, seeing her, he wanted to give it to her.\n\"Seo-ah.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nHe should probably get her a proper gift next time.\nIt felt awkward giving her something he had just picked up, so he couldn’t call it a\nreal\ngift.\n\"A present.\"\nHe handed it over playfully.\nThey used to joke around like this, giving things they already had back to each other.\nHe tried to keep it light-hearted.\n\"...Huh?\"\nSeo-ah hesitated, taking the black ribbon.\n\"Where should I put it?\"\nGood question.\nHan Si-hoo hadn’t thought that far ahead.\nThere was no place to attach it to her simple Academy uniform.\nIf only it were a school uniform.\nA uniform.\n\"Let’s go shopping for clothes.\"\n\"Outside?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nHe realized that the original plan had been to buy clothes.\nHe hadn’t known her size, so it made sense to take her along.\n\"Where do we buy them?\"\nShe asked again.\n\"There are some shops inside the Academy. They stay open even during break.\"\nHan Si-hoo answered.\nThere were plenty of clothing stores in the Academy’s shopping district.\n\"We should probably get your uniform fitted too.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nSeo-ah nodded.\n\"Let’s grab lunch while we’re out. I’ll get you something to wear for now.\"\nHan Si-hoo had offered to buy her clothes.\nShe felt guilty about taking so much from him.\nShe hadn’t done anything for him in return.\nShe felt like a burden.\nShe should give him back the money he had given her for medicine.\n\"There’s no one here.\"\nThey hadn’t passed more than three people on their way to the clothing store.\nEven those seemed to be Academy staff.\n\"It’s break time.\"\n\"That’s good.\"\n[\nWarning: External stimuli may reduce the time limit.\n]\nThat message had been popping up again.\nThe more she interacted with people, the faster the effects of the medicine wore off.\nNobody liked feeling bad.\nThey needed to get the uniform fitted and head back quickly.\nOnce the break was over, there would be more people around, so she would need a plan.\nMaybe she could refuse classes.\n\"No staff here either.\"\n\"It’s automatic as long as you have your device. They just leave the store open during breaks.\"\n\"That’s amazing.\"\nShe had known there were clothing stores in the Academy, but she hadn’t expected them to be unstaffed.\nShe hadn’t imagined an automated system for purchases either.\nHigh-tech.\nWell, it was the country’s top institution for nurturing talent, so it made sense.\n\"They have uniforms in every size over there.\"\nThe uniforms were mostly neutral colors with red accents.\nThe ties and skirts had a subtle plaid pattern.\nShe remembered being punched in the stomach out on the street.\nThose guys had been wearing the same Academy uniforms.\nWhat if she ran into them here?\nWould they recognize her?\nWhat would she do if they did?\nShe pushed the bad memories aside and focused on choosing a uniform.\n\"Why are there so many uniforms?\"\nThere were far more than she had expected.\nDid everyone get their uniforms here?\n\"Students ruin them all the time during training.\"\n\"Ah.\"\n\"Even outside of training, there’s a lot of physical activity.\"\nIt made sense.\nWith students constantly using swords, spears, and magic in their battles, the uniforms didn’t stand much of a chance.\nThe Academy wasn’t exactly peaceful.\nIt had been created to combat the constant threat of monsters.\nAs she picked out a uniform, something odd caught her eye.\nShock Absorption 3 / Mana Resistance 2.\nThe tag had strange numbers on it.\nWas this a performance chart for the clothing?\nThe Academy, with its focus on Awakened students, even made its uniforms special.\n\"How much does one of these cost?\"\nShe inspected the uniform. It looked expensive, but there were no price tags anywhere.\n\"Students can get up to five free uniforms.\"\n\"What about the sixth?\"\n\"You’d have to buy it or wait for the next distribution.\"\n\"I see.\"\nShe’d have to be careful not to ruin her uniform.\nThen again, she doubted she would be doing anything as intense as the other students.\nHadn’t someone said she’d be given special consideration?\nSpecial class, was it?\nIt certainly was special.\nThere was no way she could fight like the other Academy students.\nUnless she took another 100-hour dose of the drug.\nThe lingering memories of the euphoria remained in her mind.\n\"Did you find something?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nShe picked out what looked like her size—a skirt and pants.\n\"You can try them on over there.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nShe went into the dressing room and tried on the uniform.\nAs she was changing, she noticed something felt off.\nIt would be better to have underwear.\nShe’d need to ask Han Si-hoo to buy some too.\nFor now, she made sure the uniform fit.\nThe uniform was good enough.\nNow she needed other clothes.\nSomething to wear on a daily basis.\nShe looked at the price tags and chose something suitable.\nNothing too feminine; that didn’t feel right.\nShe didn’t think it suited her.\nShe picked clothes that wouldn’t get in the way when injecting herself.\nIf necessary, she’d have to inject through the clothes.\nNothing too thick.\nA shirt and a pair of pants.\nWhen she started looking at underwear, Han Si-hoo seemed to freeze up.\n\"What should I get?\"\nShe wasn’t sure.\nThere were too many options, and she didn’t know much about it.\nWasn’t any type fine?\nIt was a problem that there was no staff around.\n\"Oh, uh... yeah, well...\"\nHan Si-hoo seemed flustered.\nHe wasn’t much help in this area.\nBut it would have been odd if he had been.\nIt didn’t really bother her.\n\"I’ll just pick something.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nShe chose something simple.\nLuckily, long sleeves covered most of her scars.\nShe wasn’t a fashion expert, but looking in the mirror, she thought she looked decent enough.\n\"I’ll pay you back later.\"",

      "content": "There was even a place selling bandages.\nIt was a store specializing in medical supplies.\nI bought several syringes.\nEven though Han Si-hoo had brought the medicine vials, there might not have been any syringes left.\nUnfortunately, the type of medicine I wanted wasn’t available.\nStill, the Academy was vast—big enough to sell almost anything you needed.\n\"When is the entrance ceremony?\"\nI asked on the way back to the dorm.\n\"The entrance ceremony?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nThe Academy’s break was short.\nSince it was a training institution designed to prepare students to fight monsters, they couldn’t afford to take long breaks.\n\"Three weeks left.\"\nSo, there were three weeks of break remaining.\nJust thinking about hanging out with other Academy students already felt tiresome.\nThen again, making friends might be a good thing.\nRight?\nBut I didn’t like the idea of the medicine’s effects wearing off.\n\"Do you need to prepare anything else?\"\nI should double-check everything before starting school.\nEspecially since it was right before the entrance ceremony.\nThere must be something other than the uniform.\n\"Not really. You don’t need to worry about anything.\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Yeah, school supplies aren’t necessary, and even if you need weapons, the Academy provides the basics.\"\nHe trailed off.\nWas there a problem?\n\"That’s fine, but you’ll probably be assigned a new dorm around the time of the entrance ceremony. You’ll have to stay there alone.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nIt seemed I’d be getting a new dorm room.\n\"...Will you be alright?\"\nHan Si-hoo spoke with concern.\nHe tended to underestimate me.\n\"I’ll be fine. I can handle things by myself.\"\nSo far, I hadn’t had any issues going about daily life.\nThere was nothing I needed Han Si-hoo’s help for.\nI was normal.\nThere was nothing wrong with me.\nI was just taking medicine because I was unwell, but I’d get better eventually.\nThere was nothing for Han Si-hoo to worry about.\nHe couldn’t stay with me all the time just because he was concerned.\nFor now, it was fine since it was break and there weren’t many people around, but later on, people might start to find it odd.\n\"So, how will I get the medicine from now on?\"\n\"They’ll deliver it once a week.\"\n\"Delivery?\"\n\"The Academy has its own delivery system, but I’ll be the one to receive your medicine for now.\"\n\"I see.\"\nThe Academy had something like a post office?\nAs a place that gave special treatment to Awakened, it really had everything.\n\"They’ll also give you a device soon. You can use it as a phone for now.\"\n\"Alright.\"\nThat seemed necessary.\nI needed a way to contact people.\n\"If anything happens at the Academy, let me know immediately. I’ll be with you most of the time for now, but later, I’m not sure what might happen.\"\n\"Got it.\"\nHopefully, there would be no reason to reach out.\nIt was better for problems not to arise in the first place.\n\"Do you have any other questions?\"\nHe continued explaining what the Academy was like, how things worked, and its systems.\nIt was fascinating just hearing about it.\nA strict hierarchy based entirely on skill.\nI wondered where Yoo Seo-ah would fall in the Academy’s hierarchy.\nAt the bottom?\nOr maybe not, as long as I had medicine.\n3 hours 55 minutes.\nNot this medicine.\nThe kind that’s good for fighting.\nShould I ask the doctor for more?\nI didn’t have his contact info, so that wasn’t possible.\n\"Can we go back to the house?\"\nEven though Han Si-hoo had brought the medicine, home was still home.\n\"Not right now... Maybe once you’re fully recovered. Then, the Academy will issue a pass for you.\"\nI remembered needing some kind of pass when I visited Han Si-hoo to borrow money.\nIt must be a similar system.\n\"Even during break?\"\n\"Students can freely leave during break, but you’re not officially considered a full student yet.\"\nI guess that was how things worked in a boarding school.\nNot everyone wanted to be there, so the restrictions were tight.\n\"Got it.\"\nRunaways were treated like criminals.\nThe Academy was essentially a place designed to keep Awakened on a leash.\nBut I wasn’t an Awakened.\nWithout the doctor’s medicine, I couldn’t fight.\nSuddenly, I remembered being attacked by those Academy students.\nIf I had been stronger, could I have fought back?\nI had only gone outside because there was no food left in the house.\nBecause I was hungry.\nI felt hungry now too.\n\"What do you want to eat for lunch?\"\n\"Whatever you want...\"\nWe weren’t headed back to the dorm, were we?\nNow that I thought about it, he had mentioned grabbing food.\nThe food court.\nThere were several places selling food, some of them quite fancy.\nThere weren’t many people around.\n\"Let’s go there.\"\nWe entered a suitable-looking place.\nAs expected, it was run by machines.\n\"I don’t see any people.\"\n\"Yeah, a lot of places use machines for cooking, too.\"\nThat must save a lot on labor costs.\nI ate the food I was served, though I couldn’t tell if it was made by a machine or a person.\nFried rice with meat?\nI didn’t know what it was called, but it tasted good.\nBetter than canned tuna.\nNo risk of cutting myself on the can lid either.\nIt was a brief moment of normalcy.\nA day where I ate with a friend.\nI hadn’t realized that was possible.\nThere are no eternal uphill climbs, nor eternal downhill ones.\nWho said that?\nAnyway, it was time to use the medicine.\nI could feel my mood plummeting.\nHow long had it been since we got back to the dorm?\n34 minutes.\nEither way, it was time for the medicine.\nThe moment I held the syringe in my hand, my head was already buzzing with anticipation.\nI could feel my heart racing.\nThat familiar excitement.\nThe one time of day when I could genuinely smile.\nThud.\n5 hours 5 minutes.\nI felt better.\nBut the effects of the medicine didn’t seem to last long.\nWould Han Si-hoo give me more if I asked?\nHe was looking at his phone, probably checking messages.\nI remembered the bandages I had bought.\nNot wanting to disturb him, I went into the room.\nSitting on the floor, I started wrapping them around my arms.\nIt was simple.\nAfter doing it a few times, I’d gotten the hang of it.\nLeft arm done.\nRight arm.\nI had trouble with it, and the bandage kept slipping from my hand.\n\"Seo-ah?\"\n\"......\"\nThe bandage I had wrapped around my arm unraveled again.\nI was so close to finishing.\n\"Seo-ah?\"\nHan Si-hoo came into the room and called out.\n\"Y-yeah?\"\nA brief silence.\nWrapping bandages wasn’t anything strange, but it felt like I had been caught doing something I shouldn’t have.\n\"Let me help.\"\nHan Si-hoo sat down next to me.\n\"Ah, okay.\"\nI was so useless.\nI was nothing but dead weight, a burden who couldn’t even wrap her own bandages.\n\"Sorry... I can’t even do something this simple.\"\nI felt dejected.\nI’d tried to do it alone so I wouldn’t bother him.\nHe probably had lots of messages from other people, maybe even heroines, but he wasn’t meeting them because of me.\nThere was no way his story during break could be this boring.\n\"It’s fine. You don’t need to apologize.\"\nHe didn’t seem to want to look at my wounds, wrapping the bandage around my arm without really glancing at it.\nHe looked a little sad.\n4 hours 55 minutes.\nEven though the medicine was still working, I felt strange.\nMaybe because my mind was clearer, I could see myself more objectively.\nI couldn’t keep relying on Han Si-hoo.\nI wanted to do something to help him.\n\"Oh, Seo-ah, about earlier.\"\nHe finished wrapping the bandages.\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"There’s a basic ability assessment before the entrance ceremony... We need to go take it.\"\n\"A basic ability assessment?\"\nWas it the time where I’d learn my capabilities?\nIf this were a typical protagonist’s story, this would be the moment where my magic levels were off the charts.\nPeople would gasp in shock:\nA student with this much power already?!\nToo bad I wasn’t the protagonist.\n\"They’ll skip some of the tests, the ones that are physically demanding or too difficult.\"\n\"I see.\"\n\"Should we go now? We have time, but we can rest first if you want.\"\n\"Let’s go now.\"\nI wanted to know that I was worth something.\nI couldn’t be completely useless.\nI wanted someone to tell me that.\nWe left the dorm.\nNow that I had bandaged myself up, I felt more confident.\nEven if my sleeves rolled up, my scars wouldn’t show.\n\"The test isn’t a big deal for non-Awakened.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nWe talked as we walked.\n\"Don’t be upset if the results aren’t good. The test is meant for Awakened students.\"\n\"Alright.\"\nWas he trying to tell me not to be disappointed?\nHe had already taken the test himself, so he knew what to expect.\n\"What do they test?\"\n\"Things like your innate magic levels and awakening potential. And...\"\nI didn’t really understand.\nI had thought it would be like a game stat sheet.\n\"Awakening potential?\"\n\"Oh, that’s how they measure your ability to control awakened powers. For non-Awakened, it’s always zero.\"\n\"What about you?\"\n\"98. 100 is the max.\"\nOf course, as the protagonist, he had a high score.\n\"There’s more to it if you’re going into magic, like elemental compatibility and stuff, but I’m not a mage, so I don’t know much about that.\"\n\"I see.\"\nIt was hard to grasp just from his explanation.\nSeeing it firsthand would probably make more sense.\n\"There’s a machine for the test. You’ll understand when you see it. It’s not difficult.\"\n\"Alright.\"\nWhat kind of machine could do something like that?\n\"Hey, Si-hoo.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"If the test says I’m not Awakened, do I get expelled?\"\nIt would make sense to expel someone who wasn’t Awakened from the Academy.\nThere was no point in measuring anything for an ordinary human.\nI wasn’t a superhuman like Han Si-hoo.\nEven with the medicine, I had been overwhelmingly defeated.\nWhy had I even tried to fight back?\nThere had been no chance of winning.\nAnyway, even with the medicine, I couldn’t match Han Si-hoo.\nThere was no reason for me to stay at the Academy if I couldn’t pretend to be an Awakened.\n\"...No. They won’t expel you. You’re a special case.\"\nHe thought for a moment before answering.\nSpecial, huh.\nThough it was probably Han Si-hoo who was special, not me.\nWhether not being expelled was a good thing was another matter.\n\"I see...\"\n4 hours 45 minutes.\nThe walk had shaved off some time.\nThe Academy grounds were huge.\nIt was practically the size of a town.\nWe arrived at the testing facility.\nIt looked like a clean, spacious school building.\nIt didn’t seem to be a place just for testing.\nThe test wouldn’t reveal anything except how weak I was.\nI just hoped it wouldn’t be too strenuous.\nHan Si-hoo had brought extra syringes.\nBut I still didn’t want the effects of the medicine to wear off.\nThere was nothing to worry about, though.\nThe testing site had plenty of syringes prepared.",

      "content": "The test was conducted on the first basement floor of the building.\nThere were several rooms, but only one had its lights on.\nAwakener Ability Testing Room (B1-4)\nIt seemed to be Room 4 on the first basement floor.\nVarious devices were scattered around, though I had no idea how to use them.\n\"Ah, sit here,\" said Lee Yu-ram, the Academy’s health teacher.\nI thought she only handled the infirmary, but here she was.\n\"It’s better if you’re comfortable for accurate results. Si-hoo, could you wait outside?\" she said, as if implying I would be uncomfortable with Han Si-hoo around.\nI didn’t think that was necessary.\n\"It’ll take about 40 minutes. We’ll skip anything too dangerous, like trauma checks.\"\n\"Alright. Let me know when it’s over.\"\nHan Si-hoo left, likely heading to the lounge upstairs.\nTrauma checks? That sounded dangerous, but it piqued my curiosity.\n\"Alright, this is the measuring device.\"\nThe testing device was just a cube—a simple metallic block.\nIt had a futuristic vibe.\n\"Just put your hand on it, and that’s it.\"\n\"Like this?\"\nIt looked like a cube made of marble.\nI was surprised that something so simple could measure anything.\n\"It’s not difficult, right? It usually only takes a minute.\"\nLee Yu-ram spoke kindly.\nShe was always the one giving me the medicine.\nYes, she was a good person.\n\"Oh, it’s done. The results are out.\"\nNot even ten seconds had passed.\n\"That’s it?\"\nThe test was over.\nIt was shockingly fast.\n\"It’s a basic test,\" she explained.\nIt didn’t seem as complicated as I’d expected.\nShe had said earlier that it would take about 40 minutes, so there must be more to do.\n\"What’s next?\"\n\"Just a chat,\" she said, walking toward the door.\n4 hours 29 minutes.\nWas this an interview-type test?\n\"I have two options to give you.\"\nClick.\nLee Yu-ram locked the door.\nWas she keeping Han Si-hoo from coming in? Or stopping me from escaping?\nSomething felt off.\n\"Choices?\" I asked, uncertain.\n\"One: You fake your death and disappear. The cause could be anything—drug overdose, worsening injuries, whatever.\"\nI wondered if I’d heard her wrong.\nThis was completely unexpected.\nNo matter how I thought about it, I couldn’t understand her words.\n\"Right now, before the entrance ceremony, when very few people know you, you could escape the Academy.\"\n\"Escape the Academy?\"\nI hadn’t considered running away.\n\"The Academy isn’t a place that hands out expensive drugs to just anyone. If you’re going to run, now is the only time.\"\nPretending to be dead and vanishing?\nI couldn’t make sense of it.\nWhy did I need to disappear?\n\"Two: You stay here and take the drugs the Academy provides.\"\nTaking the Academy’s medicine seemed like a good option.\nWasn’t that a good thing?\nI didn’t see any downside.I could get the medicine I needed, which would be difficult to acquire on my own.\nBeing provided with medicine wasn’t a bad thing, even if it felt like I was being treated like a pet.\n\"Having lived in the slums, you should know: nothing’s free. Maybe your mind is too clouded by the drugs to realize it, but don’t be fooled by appearances. The Academy is rotten to the core.\"\nLee Yu-ram had seen a lot.\nIf she said there was something wrong with the Academy, she was probably right.\n\"No one here is going to heal you.\"\n\"Ah...\"\nWas she telling me not to expect this place to be a convalescent home?\n\"They’re going to give you military-grade drugs and expect you to fight. You’ll become a test subject for the Academy. And from there, it’s out of my hands.\"\nOf course, nothing is free.\nI’d known that all along.\nThe idea of getting free drugs forever had always seemed too good to be true.\n\"The drugs they’re going to give you aren’t like what you’ve been using. Even soldiers don’t use them. They’re too strong. They weren’t made for humans.\"\nStrong drugs.\nWere they as powerful as the 100-hour drug the doctor gave me?\n\"As a teacher, I feel obligated to help. And as a doctor, I can’t just stand by and let this happen. So, I’m telling you—get out while you still can.\"\nLee Yu-ram was sincere.\nShe genuinely believed I should escape.\nFor the first time, I seriously considered it.\n4 hours 22 minutes.\nBut there was a problem.\nEven if I escaped, where would I get the drugs?\n\"But what about the medicine?\"\n\"I have a week’s supply left for you. I’ll give it to you. You can go to another region and find a doctor I know. Maybe they’ll have a solution. I’ll explain everything to Si-hoo. He’ll understand.\"\nLee Yu-ram was speaking faster now.\nMaybe there was some chance with this unknown doctor, but I wasn’t sure.\nIt seemed better to stick with a more certain option.\nI understood that the Academy was dangerous, but the outside world wasn’t exactly safe either.\nIf I ran out of medicine, I’d die, no matter where I was.\n\"There’s no listening device in here, but if the higher-ups get suspicious of what we’re doing, it’ll be a problem. You need to decide quickly.\"\nHer urgency was clear.\nShe had arranged this entire situation to give me this choice.\nBut honestly, it didn’t feel like I had much of a choice.\n\"...What exactly is this military-grade drug?\"\nShe had said it was dangerous.\n\"It’s risky. They mix it with mana to suppress side effects, but the moment they do that, it stops being regular medicine. If you take it, you’ll be the one testing it.\"\n4 hours 18 minutes.\nThe medicine I was currently using didn’t even let me sleep properly.\nI had considered taking two doses just to get some rest.\nI couldn’t sleep well with the current dosage.\n\"I think it’s fine,\" I said.\nThis was an Awakened testing ground.\nAs long as I had the drugs, I could pretend to be Awakened.\n\"Even if I ran away to survive, it’d just cause trouble for you and Si-hoo.\"\nThe drug was strong.\nIt was military-grade.\n\"I’ve been a burden all along, and I don’t want to keep being one.\"\nA strong drug.\nIt couldn’t be true that it wouldn’t help.\nWhy call it medicine if it didn’t cure anything?\n\"So, even if I have to use the drugs, it’s better for me to be useful in some way.\"\nA strong drug.\n\"Right?\"\nGive it to me.\nYes.\nI had already crossed the line long ago.\nI was smiling now, though it wasn’t a smile I had meant to make.\nIt was just a natural response, a grin that slipped out unconsciously.Maybe it was the anticipation of using the drug.\n\"Ah, right.\"\nThere was pity and a hint of disdain in Lee Yu-ram’s voice.\nThere was nothing she could do now.\nThe military-grade drugs were issued by one of the Academy’s directors.\nIf both the Academy and I wanted this, she couldn’t refuse.\nIf only we had met earlier, when the addiction was still manageable.\nMaybe she could have saved Han Si-hoo’s friend.\nNow, it was safe to say I was as good as dead.\n\"Si-hoo will be sad.\"\nAt the mention of Han Si-hoo, my expression stiffened.\nThough I was still forcing a smile, something about it made me uneasy.\nLee Yu-ram looked a little guilty.\n\"If Si-hoo finds out you’re using these experimental drugs, he’ll be furious. It’ll be a problem for you too. The military-grade drugs will be given quietly and only when necessary. Keep that in mind.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nThere was no way I’d tell Han Si-hoo what drugs I was using.\nIf I had been loose-lipped, they might have injected me with the military drugs already without telling me.\nIf Han Si-hoo openly opposed the Academy, things would get messy.\nLosing one of their valuable students would be a serious issue.\nIt was safer to leave me alone.\nBut the Academy wouldn’t allow that.\n\"If the other students at the Academy find out, it’ll be troublesome too. That’s why we created the special class.\"\nIf I weren’t Han Si-hoo’s friend, I’d probably be locked up in a special detention cell.\n\"Can I take it now?\"\n\"You want to use it?\"\nI nodded.\n\"There’s still some time left before the deadline we agreed on. I think you can take one dose.\"\nLee Yu-ram lifted a flat suitcase from under the desk.\nInside were several automatic injectors.\n\"I’ll ask you one last time—do you really want to stay at the Academy?\"\nThis was the final question.\nIf I said yes, Lee Yu-ram would return to being just a teacher at the Academy.\nHer duty as a teacher, and the Hippocratic oath she swore as a doctor, would no longer hold meaning.\nOnly her professionalism as an Academy instructor would remain.\nShe was offering me this choice out of her connection with Han Si-hoo.\n\"...I think Si-hoo would want that.\"\nI chose to stay, rather than escape.\nLee Yu-ram, feeling that she had done her best, gave up trying to convince me.\nShe carefully pulled out the injector.\nIt was a dangerous drug.\nIf it made me lose my mind or killed me, so what?\nI had chosen the escape route, not by faking my death, but by really dying.\nThe cause could be anything—overdose, worsening injuries—either way, it didn’t matter.\n13 hours 21 minutes.\nThe test was done.\n\"Aha.\"\nThe cube had exploded.\nSeeing the shattered remains of the measuring device felt great.\nOr maybe it was just the effect of the drug.\n\"...Even for a basic testing device...\"\nLee Yu-ram seemed shocked as well.\nShe stared blankly at the shattered remains.\nI could be a protagonist now, right?\nIt was a shame there weren’t more spectators.\nA real protagonist always had an audience.\n\"How did you build such a tolerance...\"\nI took that as a compliment.\nNow I could live like a hero, receiving praise from everyone.\nI could be like Han Si-hoo.\nI could.\n\"Do you feel dizzy, nauseous, or any pain anywhere?\"\nI wanted to be like Han Si-hoo, the kind of protagonist who never showed weakness.\nI’d always wanted that.\n\"Are you okay?\"\nI wished I could be like Han Si-hoo, or one of the other Awakened.\nI wanted to live as smoothly as those whose lives seemed like a game.\nI wanted to be a protagonist.\n\"Are you alright?\"\nI had always wanted a chance, just once.\nMaybe this was my chance.\nIt had to be.\n\"Ah, yes, teacher. I was just lost in thought for a moment.\"\nI had to show I was fine.\nAnd I really was fine, but I couldn’t risk her thinking otherwise and withholding the drug.\nI had to prove I was healthy thanks to the medicine.\n\"Are you sure you’re okay?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Really?\"\nOf course.\nShe looked worried.\n\"The medicine’s working. I don’t feel any pain at all.\"\nShe still didn’t seem reassured.\n\"If you’re worried about Si-hoo finding out... He won’t know what medicine I’m using anyway, so it’s fine.\"\nHe never knew the details.\n\"I see.\"\nI had thought the Academy only had bad medicine, but now I knew that wasn’t the case.\n\"If you cause any trouble because of the drugs, you’ll be... dealt with quickly. The Academy is good at handling that sort of thing, so be careful.\"\n\"Understood.\"\nI knew the Academy was dangerous.\nIf I went berserk because of the medicine, they’d take me out.\nI understood.\nBut I wasn’t worried.\nThe medicine the doctor had given me was stronger.\nThat had been the real danger—when I’d attacked Han Si-hoo.\n\"Heh...\"\n13 hours 18 minutes.\nThere was still plenty of time left.\nI was satisfied.\nI’d lost two hours smashing the cube, but I still had a lot of time.\nI could even sleep soundly now.\nThis medicine seemed stronger than what I had at home.\n\"Ah, is the test over now?\"\n\"Yes, it’s all done. You can go. Si-hoo’s probably waiting.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nI thanked her and left the room.\nHan Si-hoo would be waiting for me.\nI should hurry.\nThere was nothing to worry about.\nThere were plenty of syringes prepared.\nStaying at the Academy was the obvious choice.\nI was glad Lee Yu-ram was reasonable.\nI climbed the stairs.\nHan Si-hoo wasn’t on the first floor.\nWas he outside?\nI could see out the window.\nAh, there he was.\nHe was talking to someone.\nTalking.\nTo someone?\n\"Rena.\"\nHer full name was longer, but I couldn’t remember it again.\nHer neat silver hair stood out.\nWhy was she here?\nThe spot where I had been stabbed began to ache slightly.",

      "content": "Han Si-hu and Lena are having a conversation. Memories of being stabbed begin to resurface slowly.\nHe said it was a misunderstanding.\nHe said there was no intent behind it.\nThat must be true.\n“Should I wait a little longer?”\nAfter all, there is plenty of time.\nThere are many soft chairs on the first floor.\nIt’s a space meant for resting.\n[13 hours 16 minutes]\nThe lights are off now, but it seems a small café operates during regular hours.\nIt’s unfortunate that it's vacation time.\nNo, it’s probably quiet because it’s vacation time, so that’s fine.\nThe sight of Han Si-hu and Lena looking out the window seemed quite comfortable.\nI was worried that I might have caused them trouble, but it seems that wasn't the case.\nIt bothered me.\nWhy?\nMaybe it’s a personal issue of Yoo Seo-ah.\nIf the person she thought was her best friend, Han Si-hu, considers someone else to be his closest friend instead.\nThere’s this unique feeling of misery that accompanies that thought.\n“…Hmm.”\nHan Si-hu isn’t my best friend.\nIt’s the medicine that truly is.\nThe best friend.\nHmm.\nThinking like that feels strange.\n[13 hours 15 minutes]\nThere’s no reason for Han Si-hu to dislike being close with the other kids.\nI wouldn’t drag Han Si-hu down to my level just because I don’t have friends.\nIt doesn’t bother me.\nLena attacked me once, so that’s a bit on my mind.\nShe’s the heroine.\nEven if Yoo Seo-ah, who should have disappeared long ago, is a nuisance, it’s still a problem.\nThe story gets tangled.\nIt’s strange that I’m still here at this point.\nI don’t know why I’m here.\nDid I make the wrong choice?\nI should have escaped from the academy.\n“Ah…”\nI slump into a soft chair and start to think.\nWhile the effects of the medicine are in play, my thoughts flow easily.\nWaiting is one of the things Yoo Seo-ah is good at.\nGetting lost in daydreams when there’s nothing to do is also something she does well.\nIf I were at home, I would have gone outside to look at the sky.\nI lie on the floor with a friend, looking at the stars floating in the sky.\nThe yard at home is not a soft grassy field.\nIt’s not that kind of yard.\nConcrete.\nBut even a yard like that was nice.\nThere’s no light pollution there.\nThe air wasn’t bad either.\nThe factory attacked by monsters couldn’t spew out smoke.\nI see stars that look like they might spill down.\nI reach my hand toward the sky.\nIt’s the ceiling.\nBut there must be a sky beyond the ceiling.\nHonestly, I don’t care much about the sky.\nHaving a friend next to me is perfect in itself.\nI recall sparkling memories.\nStill, the sky happened to be clear.\nSo, the thing I wanted to do.\nStargazing.\n—“Si-hu, do you want to go stargazing together today?”\nIt felt strange to throw out that question.\nAt that time, Yoo Seo-ah was pure in a good way and foolish in a bad way.\nShe wasn’t particularly good with words.\n—“Sorry, I rushed out… I have plans with a friend from the academy tonight.”\nA refusal.\nStill, the sky was clear.\nYoo Seo-ah lies alone, looking at the sky.\nThe sky is clear.\nStars seem to be falling.\nLike rain.\nIt was really rain.\nI think the smell of rain pooling on concrete isn’t bad either.\nYoo Seo-ah got wet in the rain for quite a long time.\nEven if it was cold, it didn’t feel that cold.\nMaybe that’s why she started coughing a bit more the next day.\nIt’s a consequence of her own actions, so there’s nothing to say.\nHonestly, I didn’t care much about the sky.\nBecause I had a friend next to me.\nBut she wasn’t there.\nThe empty space felt hollow.\nYoo Seo-ah knew it back then too.\nShe knew she was of no use.\nEven if she wanted to do something for Han Si-hu, she had no way to.\nIt was impossible to become someone recognized in this world.\nBeing with Han Si-hu was also impossible.\nEveryday life like before wouldn’t return.\nBecause she didn’t have the ability to maintain her daily life.\nIncompetence.\nThat’s the problem.\nIn the end, she gets angry at herself.\n[13 hours 8 minutes]\nNow I can’t see the sky.\nI only see the ceiling and the numbers.\nAnyway, just like before, I reach my hand toward the sky.\nI make a wish.\nEven if there’s no falling star, I still make a wish.\nI wish that no one would care if I disappeared.\nActually, I didn’t need to wish for the latter part.\nThe first part was something I could do by myself just fine.\nShould I ask to escape even now?\nThinking rationally, that seems right.\nBut it’s too late since I’ve already taken the medicine.\nI even broke the measuring device, so it’s far too late.\nBut even now, I’m not completely powerless, am I?\nI can do something.\nYeah, I’ve gained some strength.\nSo, what can I do?\nIf I use the medicine, I can mimic an awakened person.\nBut there’s a condition attached to that: not getting caught using the medicine.\nThinking it through, it’s useless.\n“Seo-ah?”\nIt’s Han Si-hu.\nIt seems he has finished his conversation.\n“Sorry, I’m late. When did it end?”\n[13 hours 4 minutes]\n“About ten minutes ago…”\nWhat could he have talked about with Lena?\nI can’t guess.\nThere’s nothing I can do about my curiosity.\nWhat if he talked about me?\n“I see. So, shall we head back now? Or is there somewhere you want to go?”\n“Somewhere I want to go?”\n“Yeah.”\nThe thought I had just a moment ago.\nGoing to see the stars together, that thing.\nIt doesn’t seem bad.\n“Then let’s go together…”\nBut Han Si-hu is busy.\nHe has a lot of friends.\nHe’s the type of person who doesn’t have time to play with Seo-ah.\n“Together…”\n“Hmm? You can say anything.”\n“…No. I’ll tell you later.”\n“Tell me anytime.”\nI don’t know many places in the academy.\nI’ve seen a rough map of the academy, but that’s about it.\n“Oh, and Seo-ah. If it’s okay, there’s someone who wants to apologize about the last time…”\nIs it Lena?\n“I see.”\n“If you don’t want to, just tell me. If you’re fine with it, she wants to come to apologize… since it might be hard for you.”\n“No.”\n“Are you sure it’s okay? If you think it’s not, just let me know. It’s really fine. If you don’t want to receive an apology…”\n“I’m fine.”\nIf apologizing eases her mind.\nShe’s the heroine, after all; it makes sense for her to get along well with the protagonist.\nIt wouldn’t be good if things got twisted because of me.\nIf I had died, it would have taken a significant amount of time to mend the relationship.\n“Oh, that’s a relief. Then stay here. I’ll call her over.”\nSaying that, he heads outside the building.\nHan Si-hu believes he’s doing the right thing.\nHe always does.\nThat’s why he’s the protagonist.\nThe person who tried to kill me is coming back.\nBut now I have strength.\n[13 hours 2 minutes]\nIf things go south, I can kill her.\nIf necessary, I could stab her too.\nOh, medicine, oh, medicine.\nI need a weapon.\n—\nPop.\nA black dagger forms in my hand.\nNice.\nWhen should I stab her?\nI’ll stab her before she attacks.\nSo I have to prepare in advance.\n“…Prepare?”\nPrepare what?\nA dagger is held in my hand.\nWas I going to kill her?\nLena?\nHan Si-hu’s friend?\n—\nIt’s too strong a medicine.\n—\nIt wasn’t made to be used on people.\nThe warning that Lee Yu-ram gave flashes through my mind.\n—\nIt’s military-grade medication.\nIt’s a drug made for fighting.\nIt’s not surprising that it shows strong aggression.\nThis is troublesome.\n“Disperse.”\nI said toward the dagger.\nIt doesn’t disappear.\nIf Han Si-hu comes back and sees this, there will be a problem.\nLena will be with him, right?\nThis time, it might not just be an attempt to kill.\nIt’s a plausible situation.\nThis isn’t what I want.\n“Disperse, disappear.”\nThe dagger remains right where it is.\nThis isn’t good.\n“I said to disappear…”\nI began to feel overwhelmed with fear.\nThis is dangerous.\n[12 hours 33 minutes]\nThere’s no time left.\nIt’s because I created a weapon.\nThe speed at which time disappears is fast.\nIn the end, it leads to panic.\n“Why, why? Why isn’t it disappearing?”\nLast time, it simply vanished.\nWhat’s different now?\n“Is it because I’m not using it and telling it to disappear?”\nIf that’s the reason, I can understand.\nHonestly, I wanted to stab her.\nA revenge for the pain she caused.\nShe should experience the same.\nNot just the same.\nStronger, more miserably, more, more, more.\nI will watch her fall into ruin.\n“Shut up.”\nThis kind of malice is unfamiliar to me.\nThe hatred is too strong.\nI didn’t expect strong medicine to mean this.\nThe dagger still hasn’t disappeared.\n—\nThunk.\nI stabbed the desk with the dagger.\nIsn’t this enough to have served its purpose?\nThey say if you draw a sword, you should at least cut something.\nSo I try to cut something.\nIt still doesn’t disappear.\n“…Seo-ah?”\nI’ve been found out.\nHan Si-hu has returned.\nIt’s not like he went far; he should come back quickly.\nHan Si-hu stands in front of me.\nBehind him, Lena follows.\nBoth of them freeze at the sight of me.\n“Oh. This is…”\nThe situation I dreaded is about to unfold.\nI’ve become a threatening figure again.\nThat villain they call it.\n“This is, uh…”\nThis time, there’s no doctor beside me.\nSo no one can take the arrows for me.\nI don’t understand why the dagger won’t disappear.\n“…Seo-ah.”\nHan Si-hu calls my name.\nHis voice is calm, as if trying to reassure me.\nBut doesn’t this scene feel familiar?\nIt was like this last time too.\nHe tried to calm me down and then intended to kill me the next day.\nThe dagger is still gripped in my hand.\nIt hasn’t disappeared.\nEven as I wish for it to vanish, there’s a part of me that doesn’t want to let it go.\nLena, who stabbed me, is standing right there.\nI feel an impulse that I should do something with this knife.\n“Seo-ah, calm down.”\nDoes Han Si-hu trust me?\nOr what thoughts cross his mind seeing me like this?\nHe’ll probably try to deal with me.\nRight.\nThey said if you act strange after taking the medicine, you’ll be dealt with.\nI never thought things would spiral out of control this quickly.\nI’m going to die.\n“Why, why are you looking at me like that?”\nI know the reason.\nIt’s because of the knife.\nFor some reason, this familiar dagger won’t disappear.\nIt feels natural that it wouldn’t fall from my hand now.\nI looked at Lena.\nLena seemed to want to say something but then closed her mouth.\n“Disperse…”\nI mutter in a tiny voice.\nI hope the dagger disappears.\nBut it doesn’t.\n“I’m not really trying to attack.”\nI say to Han Si-hu, who is approaching.\nIs he trying to subdue me?\nJust like last time?\n“Wait, really. So, just give me a moment.”\n[11 hours 52 minutes]\nTime is disappearing.\nI can’t let this happen.\n“I’m not planning to attack—”\nBut isn’t this a good opportunity?\nI think it’s okay to kill someone like Lena.\nOh, medicine, I need a weapon.\nA longsword appears in my left hand.\nA black longsword.\nThis is better than a dagger.\nI check where Lena is positioned.\nShe seems to be retreating.\nShe managed to come behind me while I was distracted.\nI need to be careful.\n“…No, I…”\nMy head hurts.\nThe hand that naturally reached to my head is still holding the dagger.\nIt looks strange to say I’m not planning to attack.\nMy words have already lost their persuasion.\nI truly wasn’t planning to attack.\nJust a moment ago, I was reminiscing about happy memories.",

      "content": "It’s already too late.\nIt’s inevitable that I look like a strange person in the eyes of others.\nI must appear to be someone who has done something wrong.\nAnd in reality, I am.\n[8 hours 5 minutes]\nThe decline of time is too steep.\nIt’s because I’ve created two weapons.\nI don’t know how to make them disappear.\nIt’s the military-grade drugs.\nDrugs made for fighting against enemies.\nI ponder who the enemy is.\n“Disappear, damn it.”\nHan Si-hu says something.\nBut I can’t hear it.\nThe sound of my heartbeat is too loud.\nI can no longer see Lena, who was frozen in place.\nWhere did she go?\nI did tell her to disappear.\nBut that was because of the sword in my hand.\nI think it over again.\nWho is the enemy?\nIt’s not the academy students.\nThey are talented individuals trying to become heroes at the academy.\nI want to be a hero too.\nI just have to kill villains and monsters.\nThat should be enough to prove it.\nI’m on your side too.\nI need to change the direction of the sword.\nThere’s no one who has benefited from attacking the main characters.\nLet’s kill the villain.\nBut where is the villain?\n[7 hours 33 minutes]\nI recall what happened last time.\nThe drug the doctor gave me.\nIt amplified my emotions to an unusual degree.\nThat’s the one.\nThis is a similar type of drug.\nIt’s a similar situation as before, but this time I’m not attacking.\nMaybe I’ve gained some self-control, or the drug’s effect is weaker.\nIt was just a simple misunderstanding.\nThere’s no reason to be angry.\nEven before the misunderstanding, I broke at least one arm.\nI was told I was subduing them.\nSo it wouldn’t be strange if a similar situation arose this time.\nBut this time I have strength, so it’s different.\nI won’t let anything be taken away from me now.\nBut I’ve already lost everything.\nI have no friends.\nI have no home.\nThe place where I belong has always been too narrow.\n[6 hours 58 minutes]\nThe drug's effect is insufficient.\nThe enemies I need to kill are nowhere to be seen.\nWhere did Lena go?\nI need to avoid surprise attacks.\nI step back, pressing my back against the wall.\nSilver hair is easy to spot.\nBut I can’t see her.\nDid she go outside?\nBut, you know.\nWhen it’s just Han Si-hu and me, it feels like a good match.\nThe place where Yoo Seo-ah should have been is now taken by Lena.\nIs it arrogant to say “instead”?\n“Ah…”\nI don’t know.\nNow even thinking feels like a luxury.\nMy instincts gradually begin to take control of my actions.\n[6 hours 22 minutes]\n“I don’t know.”\nThe weapons I created won’t disappear.\nI feel like they’ll stay like this until I win a battle.\nI sense it instinctively.\nThe fact that my fear is dulling is terrifying.\n[5 hours 55 minutes]\nI definitely need more drugs.\nI think the person preventing me from using the drugs is the enemy.\nWho has the drugs?\nHan Si-hu?\nNo, Han Si-hu just receives the drugs too.\nLee Yu-ram has them.\nThen what?\nI’ll kill him and take them.\nShould I go down to the basement?\nI never liked it from the start.\nIf the academy really wanted to help me, it wouldn’t be like this.\nThe enemy is Lee Yu-ram.\nI’ll take care of him first and get more drugs.\nAnd then?\nI’ll raid the factory where the drugs are made.\nI believe a way will appear.\n“…Found you.”\nI spot Lee Yu-ram coming up the stairs.\nHe’s holding a syringe in one hand and a bag in the other.\nWith the weapons I have now, I can’t reach him.\nIt’s too far to run, and he might escape.\n—\nThwack.\nI extend the sword, lengthening it like a spear, longer than a spear.\n[4 hours 36 minutes]\nThe consumption of time is severe.\nBut I successfully lengthen the weapon.\nA long, sharp thorn stretches toward Lee Yu-ram.\nSoon, it reaches his neck—\n“[Purification].”\nThe word is clear to hear.\nI don’t know the reason at all, but the word mixed with some sort of power resonates well.\nIt’s one of the skills Han Si-hu has.\nIt’s a passive skill, but if activated directly, it’s stronger.\nWas it activated while in contact with his body?\nContact with the body?\nBefore I know it, my arm is being held.\n“Han Si-hu?”\nPurification.\nWhat was its effect again?\nIt feels like something is about to be purified.\nCrunch.\nThe weapon I was holding crumbles like a snack.\nBlack magical energy scatters in pieces.\n[1 hour 21 minutes]\nTime feels strange.\n“Uh.”\nI need to stop.\nTime is dangerous.\nHan Si-hu must think that purification is the right action.\nTo some extent, that’s true.\nI stopped trying to attack Lee Yu-ram.\nBut this puts me in trouble.\n“Don’t.”\nI understand.\nSince he failed last time, Han Si-hu probably found his own way.\nBut that’s not the important part.\n“D-Don’t do that.”\nI push Han Si-hu away.\nBut the hand holding me doesn’t loosen.\nHe shows no sign of hostility toward me.\nThat’s the problem.\nWith one skill, four hours disappeared.\nIf I go any further, it will really be dangerous.\n“It’s fine now, so don’t do it.”\n[1 hour 14 minutes]\nNot yet.\nNot yet.\n“I’m sane. I wasn’t really trying to fight.”\nIs he thinking of saving me?\nIt’s justice.\nI can see the shining justice.\nHan Si-hu seems to be preparing his next skill.\nThat’s how it looks.\n“I’m fine…”\nI mumble again.\nMy voice has grown too weak.\nNow it sounds like my words can’t even convince me.\n“This skill… is for monsters, right…”\nThe light of justice is treating me like a monster.\nBut I’m still a human.\nI’m neither a villain nor a monster.\nHan Si-hu pauses for a moment before letting go of my hand.\nI am a human.\nMaybe.\nI am a human.\nAren’t I?\n“So, hey, the drugs…”\n[56 minutes]\nI don’t feel human.\nI think I look too pathetic.\nI don’t want to live like this.\n—\nThud.\nAh.\nIt’s the medicine.\n[12 hours 32 minutes]\n“Things are a mess.”\nLee Yu-ram says this as he surveys the first-floor lobby.\nChairs with broken legs, tables with knife marks.\nThis is within the expected range.\nIf I managed to get by without using that drug, that would be weirder.\nLee Yu-ram thinks of the military dog that was given the drug.\nYoo Seo-ah overlaps in his mind.\n“It’s my fault for letting Seo-ah meet Lena.”\nHan Si-hu feels guilty.\nThis situation likely arose from the triggering of some trauma.\nEven now, Han Si-hu doesn’t truly know Yoo Seo-ah’s condition.\nIt was intentional.\n“I thought this problem might arise, so I was going to put Seo-ah in the special class.”\n“Excuse me?”\n“Just like last time when Seo-ah tried to attack you, I can’t guarantee that something similar won’t happen. In a way, you could say it’s isolation…”\nThat’s a plausible reason.\nTo some extent, it’s true.\nI knew Yoo Seo-ah would cause trouble.\n‘Purification is unexpected. Given her condition, does it remove even the effects of drugs mixed with mana?’\nLee Yu-ram planned to intervene when the situation became serious.\nHe also had a sedative prepared in advance.\nBut Yoo Seo-ah suddenly changing her target to Lee Yu-ram was unexpected.\nThe nape of his neck, which had almost been touched by the blade, feels cold.\nIf Han Si-hu hadn’t moved, Lee Yu-ram would have had to subdue Yoo Seo-ah directly.\nStill, as a professor at the academy, there should be a way to neutralize Yoo Seo-ah.\n“Here, this is the sedative I used earlier. There’s a syringe, and this is a pill, so if things seem off, give it to her.”\nHe says this while handing over the medicine.\nIt’s a path that Yoo Seo-ah chose with her own will.\nHe hadn’t planned to give her military-grade drugs, but she wanted them so badly.\nThe plan to quietly start in the special class was just moved up a bit.\n“Will this actually heal her?”\nHan Si-hu asks with doubt.\nYoo Seo-ah’s condition.\nIs she better than when she attacked Han Si-hu last time?\nHe believes she’s genuinely saying she doesn’t want to attack.\nBut she was still holding a sword.\n“Healing isn’t that easy. We need to take our time and wait. That’s why your role is important.”\nThe problem will get more serious.\nI should have escaped when I was told to.\nLee Yu-ram thinks this as he continues.\n“Be careful when you meet people, and if it’s really difficult, ask for help. There’s a way for the academy to manage things directly.”\nBut that’s not what Han Si-hu wants.\nHe doesn’t trust the academy to that extent.\n“I know, that’s not what I want, right? It looks like the academy is holding Seo-ah hostage. I’m keeping an eye on things, but you have to take care of her well.”\nEven so, as long as the academy is the supplier of the drugs, Han Si-hu can’t rebel against them.\n“Okay. Thank you.”\n“And about that purification earlier, it seems like it’s a burden for Seo-ah. It might be better not to use it.”\nHe calculates whether Han Si-hu’s ability might interfere with the development of military-grade drugs.\nLee Yu-ram decides to mark this as a point of concern.\n“Yeah. I thought it was dangerous for the teacher…”\n“Just leaving it alone would have been fine. He’s skilled enough for that. It’s different if he were a regular student.”\nThe weapon increases in size at will.\nIn a way, the form of attack has evolved.\nWhen I first met Han Si-hu, he was just swinging a sword.\n“You were with Lena, right? Then it’s probably best to inform her separately.”\nThe fewer witnesses, the better.\nIt’s not good if rumors spread too widely.\n“Oh, I’m here.”\nLena steps out from behind a pillar, looking around cautiously.\nIt seems she was using a stealth skill.\n“Yeah. Okay. You probably have a rough idea of what’s going on, right? If you want to say something…”\nI’m trash.\nI’m something similar to a monster.\nAs long as I have the drugs, I can somehow manage.\nThat’s what I wanted to say.\n[10 hours 33 minutes]\nSo it’s back to the dormitory.\nAm I on the bed?\nI feel sluggish and weak.\nThey said it’s a sedative.\nIt feels good in its own way, but I question whether it’s appropriate for humans.\nFrom the remaining effects, it seems like it could render someone unconscious for at least several hours.\n“Ugh…”\nI haven’t even entered the academy, and I’ve already made a mess.\nI don’t even know what I’ve done.\nLee Yu-ram wouldn’t get angry and refuse to give me the drugs, right?\nIt seemed odd that he inserted the sedative as if it was prepared beforehand.\nI thought he was a nice person.\n“…Ah.”\nI finally manage to lift my body.\nI feel somewhat refreshed.\nStrangely, it feels empty.\n“Where did my clothes go…”\nThe bandages have been changed.\nThere’s ointment on the places where I had wounds.\nEven on the bruises on my stomach.\n“Y-You’re awake?”\nIt’s not Han Si-hu.\nIt’s Lena, who has her face covered with a hat, mask, and sunglasses.\nShe tried to hide her striking silver hair, but there’s no way that would work.\nShe seems to have covered herself, thinking I might recognize her and attack.\nBut now, it’s fine.\nThe effects of the military-grade drugs are minimal.\nThe sedative is too strong.\n“Ah, I was in the middle of changing the bandages.”\nBut why is she here?\nWhat conversation did she have with Lee Yu-ram?\nI don’t know where Han Si-hu went.\n“Don’t worry, I’m a friend who’s here to help you!”\nThanking her for saying that to someone who was trying to attack her just a few hours ago is a bit ironic.\nBut I don’t know why she’s doing this here.\nThis is definitely Han Si-hu’s room.\n“…Whatever happened in the past, I’ll help you.”\nWhat is she saying?\nI can’t understand, maybe because of the sedative.",

      "content": "I can manage on my own. That’s what I think.\nBut looking at how things are these days, it seems I can’t survive without the help of others.\n“Okay, so this is how you wear it…”\nI let Lena take care of me.\nI don’t really have any other options.\n“Since I know who you are, it’s okay not to hide your face.”\nIt wouldn’t really be well hidden anyway.\n“Ah, is that so?”\n“I’ll call you Lena.”\n“You knew that…”\n“I didn’t particularly plan to attack you. I was just a bit out of my mind from the medicine.”\nThat’s right.\nI have no desire to attack Lena at all.\nAt least not right now.\nAnd seeing her taking care of me shows she’s a good person.\nThere aren’t any bad characters among the heroines.\n“I’m really sorry about last time.”\nLena bows her head in apology.\n“I don’t have anything to say, but you… um, that is… you did something wrong!”\n“It’s okay. All the wounds have healed.”\n“Really?”\nIs she saying that with so many injuries on my body?\nThere are indeed a lot.\n“That’s because these were old wounds. The one from the sword has healed completely.”\nThe bruises aren’t Lena’s fault.\nShowing her my injuries changes her expression.\nIt’s not her fault.\nIt’s the academy students’ fault.\nBut who was it again?\nI feel like I’ve heard the name before.\nBut I’ve forgotten it.\n“I’m really sorry. If you want, you can stab me once!”\n“Ah, no…”\nI have no intention of doing that.\nJust because I got stabbed doesn’t mean I’ll stab someone else.\nI don’t go around attacking people unless it’s due to the drugs.\nI’m not bloodthirsty.\n“But what about Si-hu?”\nI’m curious about where Han Si-hu is.\nWhy is Lena taking his place?\n“He went out to buy some necessary items.”\n“Necessary items?”\n“…Since I lived in the slums, I didn’t know much about it, but there are still a lot of things we need.”\nI feel confident that as long as I have some medicine and food, I can manage.\nI wouldn’t say I’m particularly picky.\nSo I didn’t intend to ask Han Si-hu for anything.\nI’m somewhat satisfied with this situation.\n“Si-hu probably doesn’t know what a girl needs, so I told him. You, Seo-ah, also left it to me, a girl.”\nThat seems to be the case.\nAfter all, Han Si-hu must have felt burdened looking at my wounds.\nIn that respect, having someone like Lena around might be more comfortable for him.\nIf I’m lucky, it’s a good thing.\n“Right.”\nFor a moment, I felt like I was a doll being dressed.\nBy the time I was waiting, it was all done.\n[10 hours 2 minutes]\n“Have you been staying with Si-hu all this time?”\n“Here?”\n“No, since before. I was a bit curious why Si-hu hid the fact that he had a friend like you.”\nThat was the right choice.\nYoo Seo-ah’s existence should have remained hidden.\n“I’m just a trash human.”\nAh, I used harsh words.\nMy body is feeling sluggish, and my thoughts are becoming sluggish too.\nWords that come out without filtering are stronger than I expected.\n“…Don’t say that.”\nShe sounds just like Han Si-hu.\nIt seems friends are friends after all.\nThey match well and it’s nice.\n“It’s true. Even now, it’s hard for me to keep myself together alone.”\n“It’s just because of the medicine right now that you can’t help it. It’s fine. I heard you can be treated. You’ll get better.”\nI believe that too.\nWell, it’s medicine, so it should work for treatment.\nEven if it works, I don’t know if it’ll be useful.\n“I don’t want to hold you back like this.”\n“It’s not like that.”\n“Don’t worry. I’ll disappear someday. Just bear with it for a little longer.”\nThat’s probably the best consideration I can offer.\nThat’s what I think.\nI had to seek out Han Si-hu because I needed the medicine.\nI should have somehow prepared the medicine on my own.\nBut the doctor told me to kill Han Si-hu.\n“No, it’s not a bother. I care about you more. No one wishes for you to disappear.”\nLena is struggling.\nShe’s trying hard to elevate my value in some way.\n“Right.”\nShe’s a good person.\nShe’s lively and kind.\nEven if she seems a bit thoughtless, she’s kind.\n‘A superior version of Yoo Seo-ah?’\nRight now, she’s a bit off and quiet.\nOriginally, Yoo Seo-ah had a similar vibe to Lena.\nYoo Seo-ah just had plain brown hair, but this girl has glossy silver hair and seems well-groomed, dressed nicely.\nThe difference between an extra and a heroine is this significant.\n“I’ll repay you someday. Thanks for helping me.”\nIt’s better to express my gratitude.\nIt’s true that I will repay her.\nWhen a threat approaches the academy, I might be able to help her at least once.\nMaybe.\n“No, you don’t have to repay anything. I heard that once vacation ends, strange people will start appearing a lot... I heard you’re going to the special class. I don’t know what that is, but you need to be careful.”\nI hear warnings to be careful from everyone I meet.\nHow untrustworthy is the academy?\nIt’s probably because the state gathers students like conscription.\nIt’s because the country is in chaos.\n“And be careful of the academy students too. There are some with terrible personalities who are strong, and the academy can’t handle them. Especially if they find out you’re friends with Si-hu... some may try to use you.”\nThe bruises on my stomach are from the academy students.\nI’m well aware of the examples of people with strange personalities.\nI also don’t want to encounter them.\n[9 hours 51 minutes]\nThere’s still plenty of time left.\n“Ah, are you going to sleep?”\nI don’t know if all sedatives are like this.\nI feel sleepy again.\n“…No…”\nI won’t sleep.\nI’ll sit on the bed.\nI need to think.\nWhile I sit there in a daze, I always thought about what I had to do.\nHow to procure the medicine and when to use it.\nHow I could maximize the use of the medicine.\n[9 hours]\nThis doesn’t disappear from before my eyes.\nIt may not be visible for a moment, but it reappears when I become conscious of it.\n[8 hours 20 minutes]\nMy consciousness flickers.\nLike a light bulb that has reached the end of its lifespan.\nThere’s nothing strange about it.\n[7 hours 40 minutes]\nThe light bulb at home was like that.\nI still like that shabby house.\nEven if it seems like no one would live there.\n[7 hours]\nIs the battery dead?\nI could say it’s an old robot.It should be replaced with a new model, but it’s an old fan that has been used for decades.\nThe fan doesn’t spin, but the neck creaks as it turns.\n[6 hours 20 minutes]\nEven if I put in some lubricant, if the machine itself has defects, it’s meaningless.\nIt needs to be replaced.\nOr it should be donated to a museum as an artifact.\nBut it’s more like scrap metal than an artifact.\n[5 hours 40 minutes]\nI think in intervals of 40 minutes.\nThink for about a minute, then rest for 39 minutes.\nThat seems fine.\nMaybe just resting deeply would be better than constantly waking up.\n[1 hour 11 minutes]\n“…Medicine.”\nIt’s midnight.\nI need medicine again.\nI feel bad for waking Han Si-hu, so I decide to wait.\nHe’s sleeping on the living room floor.\nShould I cover him with a blanket?\nI pull the blanket from the bed and bring it to the living room.\nThen I cover him up.\n—\nThud.\nThat’s not a sound that should come from covering him with a blanket.\nMy wrist gets grabbed.\nA bit forcefully.\n“Si-hu?”\nI shouldn’t have touched him unnecessarily.\nIt was a mistake to wake someone who is asleep.\n“I’m sorry for waking you.”\nIt feels strange that he isn’t fully awake yet.\nIt seems he grabbed my wrist unconsciously.\nI didn’t know he had a bad habit while sleeping.\nI can guess something.\nThe ability to react even when asleep if a bad person comes near.\nMaybe he could draw a sword even while asleep.\n“Si-hu?”\nBut why is he doing this to me?\nThere hasn’t been a time when Yoo Seo-ah woke Han Si-hu up and this kind of thing happened.\nAh, is it because of the drugs?\nThe black magical energy.\nIt seems to feel quite threatening to other awakened individuals.\n[51 minutes]\nTime has decreased.\nJust from my wrist being grabbed, this is the result.\nI really need the medicine now.\nMy wrist doesn’t hurt.\nThere are some marks left, but it’s okay.\nThe effects of the drugs are still circulating.\nI probably look like a monster to him.\nI understand.\nThat could be possible.\nThud.\nI somehow manage to pull my arm away.\nThe hand that was holding my wrist falls back.\nThat’s scary.\nIf I woke him, he might choke me.\n[45 minutes]\nA significant amount of time has been consumed.\nIs he always keeping the purification skill active?\nMaybe that’s why he instinctively grabbed me.\nWhen I covered him with a blanket before, it was fine.\nWhat’s different now?\nMilitary-grade drug? Sedative?\nI’ve taken a variety.\nWhen it was the medicine the doctor gave me, it was fine.\nWhere did it go again?\n[43 minutes]\nThe medicine.\nThe one the doctor gave me.\nHe said he brought it.\nAs long as Han Si-hu hasn’t put it somewhere else, it should be here.\n“Is this it?”\nI rummage through the bag that Han Si-hu brought.\nIt’s a rude action, but I can’t help it.\nI’m scared of waking him up.\nHe must be really sleepy, so I’ll take care of it.\nI have a syringe prepared for situations like this.\nSo I just need to find the medicine.\nEven though it’s dark, I can’t turn on the living room light.\nThe light from the room is enough.\n[40 minutes]\nThis is why I don’t like relying on others.\nI’m scared that time will run out.\nI liked the house where I could do whatever I wanted.\n“I found it.”\nIt’s not in the bag but on a high shelf.\nStanding on a chair, I can reach it.\nThe blue liquid inside swirls.\nSomehow, it seems like there’s less than the last time I saw it.\nI’ll go to the room and use it.\nThe living room is too dark.\n[37 minutes]\nI unwrap the bandage on my arm.\nWith trembling hands, I pick up the syringe.\nI need to fill it with the medicine.\n“Ah, my wrist.”\nIt’s not painful, but there seems to be a problem.\nI don’t know how hard Han Si-hu grabbed it.\nThe right hand is the problem, so I’ll use my left.\nI broke one syringe.\nIt’s okay; I have plenty of extras.\nIt seems a bit difficult to manage with just one hand.\n[33 minutes]\nThe urgency rises due to time constraints.\nBecause the needle of the syringe bent, I can’t use it again.\n“Seo-ah?”\n“Uh?”\nHan Si-hu is awake.\nHe’s looking at me with his hand propped against the door.\n“What are you doing?”\n“Hey, I’m going to use the medicine.”\nI haven’t done anything wrong.\nHe said it’s okay to use it when necessary.\n“How much have you used…?”\nThere are two syringes sprawled on the floor.\nA small amount of medicine drips from them.\n“I haven’t used any yet. So help me. It seems the syringe isn’t working well.”\n“If you had said something, I would have given it to you.”\nWhy is he looking at me with a disappointed expression?\nI haven’t done anything wrong.\nI’m sorry for rummaging through the bag and the shelves, but it’s because of the medicine.\n[29 minutes]\n“There’s still time left. Can you give me the medicine from the academy? Even now.”\nIt’s not too late.\nIt’s still not too late.\nHan Si-hu quietly grabs the medicine bottle.\n“What about the medicine?”\n“You’ve already used a lot. And I don’t even know what this is yet, so why are you taking it without saying anything…”\nI was scared to wake him up.\nIt would have been better to say something before using it.\nBut more importantly, I still haven’t used it.\n“Ah, I haven’t used it yet. My arm hurts. No, anyway, I haven’t used it yet, right? Are you not going to give it to me?”\n[26 minutes]\nThere’s no time left.\nI think there’s been a misunderstanding.\nI must have confused something in my sleep.\n“I’m sorry, but not now.”\nThat’s a lie, right?",

      "content": "“I swear, I haven’t used the medicine yet.”\n[21 minutes]\nI’m getting anxious.\n“So just give it to me.”\nOn the floor are the syringes that fell and the one I was about to use.\nIn the circumstances, it’s understandable to think I’ve used the medicine more than once.\nBut I’m saying no, I don’t use it so recklessly.\n[19 minutes]\n“I promise it’s true. I was about to use it, but I haven’t yet.”\nI’ve never broken a promise before.\nIt looks like I was definitely abusing drugs, but that’s not the case.\n“…I’m sorry. No.”\n“Why?”\n“For you.”\nThat’s not for me.\nHan Si-hu doesn’t believe me.\nWhat do I need to do to make him believe me?\nMy heart starts racing.\n“Anyway, you’re treating me like a monster. Doesn’t it matter whether I use a little or a lot of medicine?”\nI think I’ve made a mistake.\nIn my urgent state, I said something wrong.\nHan Si-hu’s expression hardens slightly.\n“No, it’s not like that. …You’re my friend.”\nHe’s managing to say that.\nIf you’re a friend, you should give me the medicine when I ask for it.\n“…I really haven’t used it.”\n[17 minutes]\nI can’t control my emotions.\nMy wrist starts to throb.\nI can feel the effects of the medicine wearing off.\n“Ah, we can just wait. How about this: I can wait about 5 minutes.”\n“I’m sorry.”\n“Even if you say I’ve already used it, it would be fine just once. Please, okay?”\nLet’s say I’ve used a lot of it.\nEven so, it should be fine just once.\nThere shouldn’t be any problem.\nWhen a friend asks like this, I think it’s right to oblige.\n“Let me use the medicine.”\nYou have it, don’t you?\nYou said you’d give it to me when I need it.\n“I’m sorry.”\n“Just once.”\n[17 minutes]\nSuddenly, the doctor’s words about the medicine being more addictive than the previous one come to mind.\nRight, it means the medicine was addictive.\n“Just calm down for now.”\nHow about giving me a sedative instead?\nThere’s no time.\n“Ah, haha.”\nI’m trying to calm down somehow, but it’s not working.\nMy heart is racing uncontrollably.\n[10 minutes]\nBefore I know it, only 10 minutes are left.\nWhy is time disappearing so quickly?\n“It hurts, this really hurts. I need the medicine.”\nIn desperation, I grab Han Si-hu’s collar.\nHis eyes tremble.\nIt’s truly dangerous now.\nI need the medicine.\nI reach out for the medicine Han Si-hu is holding.\n—\nThud!\nMy fingers graze the medicine bottle, but I can’t grab it.\nThe bottle falls from Han Si-hu’s hand.\nThe bottle drops.\nDownward.\nDownward.\nTo the floor.\nThud.\nThere’s a dull sound as it hits the ground.\nThe glass shatters.\nThe liquid inside spills onto the floor.\nMy happiness flows away.\nMy mind goes blank.\n“Ah.”\nThis isn’t what I intended to do.\nThe blue liquid pours out onto the floor.\nI can’t process the information coming into my view.\n[7 minutes]\nBroken glass shards scatter everywhere.\nThe blue medicine is on the floor.\nWhy is it on the floor?\nMy mind is blank.\nI stand frozen in place for a moment.\n“W-Wait. I’ll get something to clean it up.”\nHan Si-hu says that and heads toward the entrance.\nHe looks very flustered.\n[2 minutes]\nFive minutes have vanished?\nIt hasn’t even been a minute.\nTime has evaporated at an astonishing rate.\nI need the medicine.\nI have the syringes.\nThe medicine is on the floor.\nLet’s say I somehow managed to put the medicine in the syringe.\nWith my trembling hands, I can hardly get the injection right.\nI see the blue medicine pooling on the floor.\nWould it still be effective if I just drank it?\nI’ve never tasted this medicine before, but I think it would still have an effect.\nI kneel down to pick up the glass shards.\nThere’s a little bit of medicine pooled there.\nI drink it.\nGulp.\nThe medicine brushes against my tongue and slides down my throat.\nIt has a slightly sour taste.\nIs it vinegar?\nIt feels like my throat is burning.\n[1 minute]\nTime keeps shrinking.\nWhy?\nWas the amount insufficient?\nShould I really bring the syringe?\nNo, even if I have the syringe, it would still be difficult.\nWhat should I do?\nIf Han Si-hu comes out of the room, he’ll prevent me from taking the medicine.\nHow should I use the medicine?\nIt’s all pooled on the floor.\nI tried to scoop it up with my hands, but it doesn’t work.\nThat’s only natural.\nIt’s not enough with just what’s stuck to my fingers.\nThere’s only one way left.\nI leaned my body down.\nI licked the medicine pooled on the floor.\nIt’s hard to lick up.\nIt feels like the shards of glass and dust are mixed in.\nI still don’t feel good.\nI feel like a dog.\n[1 minute]\nAt least time hasn’t dropped any further.\nThat’s a relief.\nThat was close.\n“Yoo Seo-ah!”\nHan Si-hu grabs me and pulls me upright.\nThe glass shards fall from my arm.\nBlood seeps from my palm.\nI had been crouched on the floor, and something was sticking to my arm.\nI was pricked by the glass shards.\n[3 minutes]\nI think Han Si-hu is saying something next to me.\nIt still feels like something is lacking.\nBut I’ll endure.\nI’m someone who can practice restraint.\nIt’s not an addiction.\nI just tried the medicine because I had no choice.\nHan Si-hu takes me somewhere.\nAnyway, I had no intention of drinking more medicine.\nIf I use a large dose at once, I’ll die.\nThe doctor said that even water can have a lethal dose.\nLet alone medicine.\nIn a situation where I can’t measure the amount like now, I especially need to be careful.\nI’m not an idiot.\nI can’t just gulp down all the medicine blindly, knowing it might be lethal.\nI don’t want to swallow glass shards either.\nI spit out the small glass shard that was in my mouth.\nSomething thick and salty is stuck on my tongue.The taste of metal.\nIs it blood?\nAnyway, I didn’t swallow the glass.\nProbably.\n[15 minutes]\nTime has risen a bit.\nI can think rationally again.\nIs the effect of the medicine slowly coming?\nI feel strange.\nI don’t know what happened before.\nThere was the blue medicine.\n“Uh.”\nThere’s blood on my hands.\nSince it doesn’t hurt, it doesn’t seem to be my blood.\nIt must be someone else’s blood.\nWho was around?\nHan Si-hu.\nDid Han Si-hu get hurt?\n“I’m sorry.”\nI tried to apologize with a smile.\nThere’s a saying that you can’t spit on a smiling face.\nBut the reaction is strange.\nIt doesn’t seem to be my fault if Han Si-hu got hurt.\nI look down at my hands.\nIt’s still dripping.\nI was the one who got hurt.\nI can’t even remember what I just did.\nWhere are the bandages?\nIf blood flows, the effects of the medicine wear off faster.\nI know this because I’ve experimented with it before.\n[13 minutes]\nAh, damn it.\nI think I need to take a little more medicine.\nTime is running out faster than it’s rising.\nWhere’s the medicine?\nThere’s still some of the spilled medicine on the floor.\nI need to go back.\n“Let go of me.”\nHan Si-hu grabbed me.\n“Hey, I need to take the medicine.”\nFear.\nI can’t understand the will to prevent me from using the medicine.\nIf I don’t take it now, I really might want to die.\n“I want to use the medicine.”\n“I’ll give it to you, so wait.”\n“Okay.”\nI begged earnestly, and it worked.\nAfter all, he’s the protagonist.\nHe shows a semblance of mercy at the very least.\n[11 minutes]\nI’ve calmed down a bit.\n[10 minutes]\nI can’t calm down.\nMy heart is racing.\nI force myself to settle down.\nBut that’s unlikely.\nIf I take the medicine, I’ll feel happy.\nIn the first place, I should have been happy without taking the medicine.\nWhy am I in this kind of situation?\nBecause Han Si-hu isn’t giving me the medicine?\nIn the end, the blue medicine spilled on the floor.\nIf I could have put all that into the syringe, how happy would that have been?\nThe medicine bottle broke.\nMy happy days vanished.\nI believed.\nI thought he would give me the medicine.\nIt’s just that Han Si-hu doesn’t believe me.\nHe doesn’t think of me as a friend.\nAt most, I’m just an object to be managed.\nIn a situation where it’s likely to misunderstand that I’m abusing the medicine, but still.\n“Here.”\nGulp.\nHan Si-hu hands me the pills.\n[43 minutes]\nThe medicine is replenished again.\n“Thank you.”\nI express my gratitude.\nEven though I’m not really a friend, he’s looking out for me, which is because he’s a good person.\nThat’s all I can say.\nAs time passes, everything around feels softer than usual.\nI feel happy again.\nIt seems like I can see a clear sky.\n“…Ah he he.”\nThere’s a rose in my hand.\nIsn’t that something magical?\nIt’s red.\nIt looks like a bouquet I could give as a gift.\nIt would be nice to tie it up with a ribbon and give it.\nI just received one.\nThe one Han Si-hu gave me.\nIt was in my pocket.\nWhen I place it on my hand, it really looks like a bouquet.\nThe ribbon is stained with red petals.\n“Where did the flower go?”\nOnly blood-stained hands and a blood-stained ribbon remain.\nI’m not in my right mind.\nI’m becoming more of a mess.\n[41 minutes]\nHan Si-hu is inspecting the syringe with the medicine while talking to someone.\nHe looks quite urgent.\nIs he going to give me more medicine?\n41 minutes is a little risky.\nNow the ribbon slips from my hand.\nI can’t tell if it melted or fell to the ground.\nIt’s hard to distinguish.\nIs it because I drank the medicine?\nIt’s not for drinking anyway.\nBlood flows from my mouth as well.\n“Ah ha…”\nIt feels like I’m becoming happier.\nBut my head hurts.\nI pick up the syringe that was on the ground.\nEven though I failed to put in the medicine, a little bit is still inside.\nEven if the needle is damaged, I just stab it in.\nThud.\n[1 hour 18 minutes]\nEven if I say I haven’t used it, he wouldn’t believe me.\nSo let’s just say I did.\nI don’t have the confidence to persuade him anymore.\nIf I were Han Si-hu, I wouldn’t believe me either.\nThud. Thud. Thud. Thud.\nI just keep stabbing.\nIt’s fun.\nEven if the time doesn’t extend further.\nThe syringe is originally meant to be used once.\nReusing it is dangerous.\nThud. Crack.\nWhile stabbing, the syringe broke.\nIt’s weaker than I expected.\nNow my head really hurts.\nHan Si-hu finishes his call and rushes toward me.\nThud.\nWith a slight dull sound, I fall sideways.\nGet up.\nI’m not weak, so I can stand up.\nThud.\nI try to get up again but fail.\nHan Si-hu happened to catch my head, so there was no thud sound.\n[1 hour 9 minutes]\nHan Si-hu is next to me.\nHe seems to be asking if I’m okay.\n—\nThud.\nIs it the medicine?\n[11 hours 12 minutes]\nThis is a sedative.\nMy consciousness is hazy.\nI wonder how Han Si-hu sees me.\nWhy isn’t he giving me the medicine?\nIf I think about it, the answer will come to me.\nI visualize my objective self.\nSyringes scattered on the floor.\nA broken medicine bottle.\nUnraveled bandages.\nLiquid spilling from the syringes.\nWhat’s that?\nI’m a serious addict.",

      "content": "The Yoo Seo-ah you knew disappeared a long time ago.\nIt would be better to just let her die here.\nThink about the future.\nHow long do you plan to let the doctor hold you back?\nHan Si-hu, come to your senses.\nIt’s better to deal with that wraith right now.\nWhat’s left is just the shell of Yoo Seo-ah.\nShe’s decayed because of the drugs.\nNo one will know.\nIf you say she died because of drugs, that’s it.\nDo you think this is the appearance of the friend you once knew?\nLicking up the drugs spilled on the floor?\nShe’s just another addict you often see in the slums.\n—Si-hu.\nI see Seo-ah smiling brightly.\nShe must be asking for the drugs.\n“Here, a gift.”\nBut that wasn’t it.\nWhat I gave as a gift was a paper crane made from origami.\nThe last time I folded one was as a reward for a ribbon.\nBack then, the origami book was torn, so I couldn’t fold it properly.\nBut now, with a good smartphone, I can do it.\nA useless gift.\nThrow it in the trash.\nStill, there will be no reaction.\nIf I give her drugs, it wouldn’t matter what I did.\nIt must have been like that even before she came to you.\nWhat would she have done?\nShe must have needed a lot of money.\nHan Si-hu, you know it best, right?\n“Si-hu?”\nI can feel the pretense.\nHan Si-hu, you’re more sensitive to such signs than anyone else.\nYoo Seo-ah is just trying to get drugs.\nShe’s not giving you a gift for your sake.\n[Status Window]\nLevel: 26\nHealth: 1291, Mana: 910...\nSkills: Swordsmanship IX, Magic VI...\nStatus: Purification Penalty (5 hours)\nIt’s because of [Purification].\nTo be precise, Purification I.\nThere’s a reason why it’s still a level 1 skill.\nI’ve been quite reluctant to use it myself.\nPurification is like a vacuum cleaner.\nIt sucks in the dirty things.\nIn return, dust accumulates inside.\nHan Si-hu is suffering from a penalty for a similar reason.\n“Don’t like it?”\nThe mana clinging to Yoo Seo-ah.\nThe weapon I thought I couldn’t create was now in my hand.\nIt was a thick black mana filled with malice.\nI shouldn’t have used purification after all.\nSeo-ah hated it too.\nI didn’t treat her like a monster...\nOr did I?\nMake some sense.\nA voice constantly whispers in my head.\nIf I use purification more and level up the skill, it might get better, but not right now.\n“Aha…”\nIt’s not the laugh you knew.\nShe’s like this because of the drugs.\nShut up.\n“Ah, thank you for the gift.”\nI snapped back to reality and answered.\nYoo Seo-ah was flustered, staring at Han Si-hu, who was just standing still.\nThe purification penalty is more bothersome than I imagined.\nEven sleeping doesn’t make it go away.\nIt was similar when I used purification on monsters.\nIt was just a simple voice saying to kill and destroy, but after that unpleasant experience, I decided to stop using it directly.\nAs long as it’s on passive, it only causes a bit of discomfort, so it’s okay to use it at that level.\nHow long do you plan to keep Yoo Seo-ah alive?\nYou might think it’s unpleasant, but it’s not wrong.\nTraining, growth, even human relationships are crumbling.\nIf you’re not getting calls from people, it won’t be good for you either.\n“Si-hu.”\nIf you leave it like this, Yoo Seo-ah will just keep suffering.\nHow painful it must be not to be able to control herself.\nLet’s strangle her here and end it.\nIf you don’t like that, stab her with a knife.\nOr trick her with drugs and give her poison.\nThe potent poison and the drugs she’s taking now are similar.\n“Si-hu, I need some drugs…”\nSeo-ah came back again.\nIt’s time to sleep.\nBut she can’t sleep well.\nHonestly, it’s annoying for you too.\nHow long do you plan to stay like this?\nYoo Seo-ah also hopes you’ll kill her.\nShe said it back then.\nPlease kill me.\n“Here.”\nGiving her drugs means slowly killing her.\nNew wounds appeared on my arms and hands.\nI’m even wrapping bandages around my hands.\nDo you think taking drugs will help?\nYou know it’s not a cure.\n“Thank you.”\nLetting her use a sedative would be convenient.\nI’m just acting according to Lee Yoo-ram’s advice.\nLet’s just kill her.\nNo need to feel guilty.\nYou heard what Seo-ah said.\nMuttering that dying might not be so bad, that’s the real gift.\nShut up.\nYou’re not even cleaning up the used syringes.\nYou’re just lying around.\nYou’re just a bug.\nYou even called yourself trash.\nJust a waste.\nShut your mouth.\nI’m just stating the facts.\nThe academy entrance ceremony is coming soon.\nIf Yoo Seo-ah is like this, what will happen in the special class?\nAre you trusting the academy?\n—Next, the weather forecast for tomorrow. Strong winds and rain are expected in the area of old Seoul, Zone 1, where the gate alarm has been issued...\nSeo-ah is staring blankly at the broadcast screen.\n“Si-hu.”\nSuddenly she opened her mouth.\n“Yeah.”\n“I’ll pay back the debt.”\n—Estimated damage is roughly 5 billion won...\nIt seems she’s talking about the money she borrowed.\n“No, keep the money. It’s a gift. I might need it later.”\n“......”\nShe looks like she wants to do something but can’t do anything.\nWhat Yoo Seo-ah finds most frustrating is herself.\nShe’s essentially a being that doesn’t belong in this place.\n“…Si-hu. What do you want to do the most?”\n—The predicted path of the typhoon...\n“What I want to do?”\nTo heal Seo-ah.\nTo bring her back to the way she used to be.\nThat’s the priority for now.\n“Something you hope for.”\nI want to turn back my choices.\nI want to go back in time and save Seo-ah.\nI want to save her from the evil that penetrated her life without me knowing.\nBut it’s too late now.\nIf we were to talk about it, we’re reaching the climax.\nYou can feel Yoo Seo-ah’s story slowly coming to an end.\nMaybe it’s a story that should have already ended.\nShut up.\nThere must be hope.\n“…Maybe to return to the way it was.”\nBack to when there were no problems.\nEven if there were problems, we could solve them together.\nIt’s painful to see a broken friend.\nShe keeps overlapping with the past.\nThe cheerful smile from back in the day.\nNow, she just grins and giggles under the influence of drugs.\nI recall the past.\n—Didn’t I win today? I came here first, right?\nIt’s a memory of the race we had.\nIt’s hard to understand the past just by seeing her stuck at home.\n—Did you think I forgot your birthday? Actually, I was preparing it on purpose. Were you surprised?\nMemories of her birthday.\nLittle cakes bought with small amounts of saved money.\nThere was always a good friend when I came home.\nEven calling her family would have been fine.\nAll in the past tense.\nI was happy back then.\nBut what about now?\nMy childhood friend has lost her mind.\nShe’s filled with wounds that she doesn’t even know who inflicted them.\n“Back to the way it was…”\nYoo Seo-ah says, shifting her gaze back to the screen.\n“Back to... the way it was...”\nShe mumbles again.\n“What was it like back then?”\nIt’s something she wishes for too.\nShe half-covers her face with her fingers as if in deep thought.\nThe band-aid and the new bandages are noticeable.\n“I’ll do my best to make it happen.”\nFirst, I need to change my voice a bit.\nIt’s too lethargic in tone and manner.\nI’m tired, and the sedative is a big part of that.\nI practice while looking in the mirror of the room.\nWith the door closed and speaking softly.\n“Ah, ah.”\nThere’s still time until the academy entrance ceremony.\nI’ll manage to figure something out before then.\nLet’s help Yoo Seo-ah regain her bright self.\nThat’s what Si-hu wishes for.\n“Hello.”\nSmile, and try to smile naturally.\nI’m good at smiling, after all.\nOther than that, I don’t have much to show for myself.\nI can manage to smile.\nIt feels like there’s a bit of relaxation around my eyes.\nLet’s recreate a sunny smile, the complete opposite of Yoo Seo-ah’s current state.\nI call to mind good memories from the past.\nSituations where Yoo Seo-ah would smile.\nHow did we laugh during those happy days?\n“Hello, Si-hu.”\nShall I surprise her?\nDid Yoo Seo-ah say that when she was younger?\n“Hello.”\nFortunately, I remembered how to smile.\nI’m smiling even more than when I borrowed money from Han Si-hu last time.\nWhat a mess.\nWhile thinking that, I try to maintain my expression.\nBut it’s not working well.\nThere’s that special kind of silly brightness in my smile.\nIt’s different from the expression soaked in pleasure.\n[5 hours 11 minutes]\nThere’s plenty of time, so it’s okay to smile.\nI usually don’t have moments where I don’t smile, though.\nIt’s rare for Yoo Seo-ah to treat someone with a straight face.\nThere are those who find it harder to not smile.\nYoo Seo-ah belongs to that group.\nShe was such a bright person.\n“…Getting hit, stabbed with a knife, and still keeping a bright appearance is more…”\nStrange.\nIsn’t it scary?\nNo, it was a bit funny even while actually getting hit.\nAm I the scary one?\n“Maybe I should start exercising again.”\nOf course, I wouldn’t match the awakened ones.\nI’m just going back to the time when Yoo Seo-ah was active.\nIf I do any strenuous activity, the drug effect will wear off.\n[5 hours 9 minutes]\nThe reason I haven’t gone out much since I started taking the drugs is this.\nThere were warnings that the effect might wear off from time to time.\nI feel sorry for Han Si-hu.\nI couldn’t repay what I received.\nI was just a spectator to my broken friend.\nIf this continues, I’ll indeed be trash.\nStaying as a burden is a problem.\nIt’s wise not to drag Han Si-hu down.\n“Again.”\nI smile.\nYoo Seo-ah didn’t always smile monotonously.\nLet’s try to mimic her.\nBut there’s a strange fear seeping into my expression.\nI seem lacking in confidence.\nNo matter how much she lived in the slums, Yoo Seo-ah was overflowing with self-esteem.\n“Smile.”\nWas it from the moment I couldn’t overcome the drugs?\nOr was it from the moment I pushed Han Si-hu away?\nOr was it just from the moment I acknowledged my own incompetence?\n“Again.”\nI want to break the mirror.\nWhy are you still here?\nYou’re living so well and walking around.\nIt feels like I’m cursing you.\n“Again.”\nI recall the happy memories from the past.\nThe doctor gave me drugs.\nI still remember that 100-hour one vividly.\n“If I do well... I can use drugs.”\n[4 hours 54 minutes]\nI have spare syringes with me.\nAfter all, Han Si-hu doesn’t know how much I need to use.\nIt’s wise to keep some as a precaution.\nThis is the syringe I saved for times like this.\nLet’s smile properly.\nHeh.\nHehe.\nAha.\nNow it seems I’m smiling well.\nI look happy.\nAh.\n[8 hours 1 minute]\nNice.",

      "content": "Hello. Nice to meet you.\nI am Cheon Yu-seong, and I have entered the academy.\nI am a 16-year-old male...\nAnd I have awakened my ice powers.\nFirst-year high school student.\nI can’t help but feel my heart race just waiting to enter this prestigious academy, which often appears on broadcasts.\n“Haha.”\nThe girl sitting next to me must also be a new student.\nShe’s wearing a black eye patch over one eye.\nCosplay?\nThe atmosphere feels unusual, making it hard to strike up a conversation.\nEven a quick glance feels burdensome.\nI regret sitting here, but it’s because there weren’t many empty seats.\nIt’s probably because I arrived late.\n“Hehe.”\nI keep smiling strangely.\nThough the academy is a place of envy, I’ve heard there are many odd people here.\nIndeed, I see many unique individuals.\nThere are plenty of intimidating figures too.\n“…The oath.”\nI can see the new student representative standing in front of the auditorium.\nShe has blue hair, just like mine.\nHer name is Cheon Yu-hwa.\nShe’s my twin sister.\nShe’s holding a microphone and saying something, but I can’t focus.\n“Hey, you.”\nThe girl next to me spoke in a strange tone.\nThe bandages wrapped around her hand are probably a fashion statement, just like the eye patch.\nI wonder if her uniform originally had a ribbon on the sleeve.\nHer eyes seem unfocused, which makes her even scarier.\nI’ve been taught to be cautious around this kind of style.\n“…Excuse me?”\nI think she’s cute, but it’s also scary.\nThis isn’t what I imagined school life to be like.\nI can’t hear my sister’s oath over her voice.\nI’m guessing it’s something good about entering the academy.\n“How dare you sit in the same space as me.”\nWas she offended?\n“I’m sorry.”\nNow I understand why there was no one sitting next to her.\nAn eye patch and bandages—could this be what people call a “chuunibyou”?\nI’ve heard there are often such cases among the awakened.\n“Consider it an honor. You probably won’t see me in the academy much from now on.”\n“I’m sorry…”\nI keep apologizing.\nWhat is she saying when we’re both new students?\nIt’s better to keep my distance.\n“…This concludes the new student oath.”\nYu-hwa steps down from the podium.\nI knew my sister would handle this well since she’s familiar with these kinds of events.\n“Next, new student representative Han Si-hu will share his thoughts…”\nHan Si-hu?\nI think I’ve seen this person on the news.\nA sudden rising star since last year.\nI’ve heard he was the most notable talent in the middle school department.\nI’d like to have a match with him someday.\nBut Yu-hwa in front of me is probably the better fighter.\n“Hello, academy freshmen…”\nSomehow, it feels like he’s looking this way.\nIt seems our eyes meet.\nThe gaze is fine, but the kid next to me is burdensome.\nI want to change seats, but it’s impossible in this atmosphere.“Um, may I ask your name?”\n“Are you daring to ask my true name?”\nTrue name?\nMy head starts to hurt.\n“I acknowledge your courage. It’s Yoo Seo-ah. And you?”\n“Cheon Yu-seong.”\nSeeing the name Yoo Seo-ah makes me cautious.\nIf this continues, she might end up without any friends, and I feel sorry for her.\n“Why are you wearing bandages and an eye patch?”\nI’m curious.\nI’ve never seen anyone like this before.\n“It’s a seal.”\n“Pardon?”\n“I’m suppressing the power of darkness; it would be better if you keep your distance.”\nIf this were a normal situation, I’d probably think she’s just a hurt kid.\nBut the problem is that this is an academy for the awakened.\nIt wouldn’t be strange if something truly was sealed within her.\n“Oh, I see.”\nIf other students look like this, school life might be pretty tough.\nI hope that’s not the case.\nIt would be nice if there were some normal people here.\n“You. You have the same hair color as Yu-hwa.”\nThat’s right.\nBlue hair is rare.\nStill, various colors seem to appear at the academy.\nI wonder if it’s related to the awakening.\n“We’re family.”\nSince we’re twins, we should at least share the same hair color.\n“Indeed.”\nI have no idea what kind of environment someone must grow up in to speak like that.\nBut I understand.\nSince the world is chaotic, anything is possible.\nWhile worrying about the person next to me, time passed quickly.\nSomeone got on and off the podium several times.\nThen someone who looks important climbed up.\nI heard he’s the principal.\nThis isn’t the image I usually think of when I hear “school principal.”\nThe principal looks young.\nFrom appearances alone, he seems to be in his 30s.\nHe’s probably one of the influential figures in the academy.\nHe must be an elite among the awakened.\nSince today is the entrance ceremony, he might have something special to say.\n“Welcome.”\nThe principal opened his mouth.\nEven standing still, he exudes a strong presence.\nI can feel he’s among the strongest of the awakened.\n“Congratulations on becoming a proud student of this academy.”\nThe principal continues his speech.\nThe girl next to me finally averted her gaze.\nThat’s a relief.\n[15 hours 4 minutes]\nI used a bit more of the drugs to prepare for meeting a lot of people.\nHan Si-hu might not know, but I packed five syringes as a precaution before the entrance ceremony.\nI used two today.\nThat leaves three left.\nFortunately, I haven’t had any issues with the drug’s effect wearing off.\n[15 hours 3 minutes]\nNo, I might have overused the drugs today.\nMaybe that’s why my head feels a bit fuzzy.\nBut isn’t it okay as long as I’m happy?\n“…That’s it.”\nClap, clap, clap.\nThe sound of applause grows louder.The principal stepped down.\nIt’s time for me to rise as well.\nThe special class needs to leave their seats a bit early.\n“I will remember today’s meeting. Consider it an honor.”\nCheon Yu-seong.\nCheon Yu-hwa.\nI know there’s something between them.\nIf something happens, Han Si-hu will probably handle it.\nBy the way, that tone is a concept.\nAs for the reason, it’s that...\nLet’s go back a week.\nSpending my days staring blankly at the TV screen.\nI stopped scrolling through channels at the animation corner.\nIt’s an anime with magical girls.\nIf Seo-ah had grown up in a proper environment, would she have watched this and enjoyed it?\nIt’s fun to watch.\n—Is it finally here?\nIt seems like it’s the final chapter.\nThe main characters are gathered to defeat the boss monster.\n—Look at the evil deeds you’ve committed!\n—Now that we’ve come this far, there’s no other way. It will be the final battle.\nThe scene of them fighting with wands is impressive.\nIf you look closely, maybe one of the awakened will fight like that?\n—It’s the time of judgment.\nI wonder if Seo-ah would have played along and had fun if she could see this.\nGiven her circumstances, she seems to have matured too quickly.\nShe shows a pure side, but I haven’t really seen her act like a child.\n—With the power of love!\n“Umm…”\nTo mimic something like that.\nIf it were the bright Yoo Seo-ah from back in the day, it might have suited her.\nI’m curious what she would have looked like, so I give it a try.\nThe protagonist's pose.\nProtagonist-like dialogue.\n“With the power... of love.”\nIt’s not easy.\nIt feels pathetic.\nLooking down at my arm, I see the marks from the injections.\nI’ve wrapped the bandages around it.\nAt this angle, I look closer to the boss monster.\n“Hey, even they have bandages on.”\n—Hmph, it looks like I’ll have to use this after all.\nIf I were to mimic, that would be appropriate.\nShould I give it a shot?\nIf there was a scene where Seo-ah played like this.\nWhat would that have been like?\n—I am one born from the abyss, destined to change the world! No one dares to stop me!\nIs that a spell?\nIt’s hard to keep up.\nExtending one hand forward, as if preparing an attack, I say.\n“Born from the abyss... destined to change the world...”\nI stretch my arm out into the air.\nWith one hand behind.\nHmm.\nThis might be more plausible than mimicking the protagonist.\nI think it would look even more fitting with an eye patch.\nBang.\nThe door burst open.\nRena appears.\nI was just striking a pose.\n“Hmm?”\nShe’s smiling.\nShe looks more playful than usual.\n“Ah…”\n“Born from the abyss, destined to change the world… what was it again?”\nShe mimics me.\nShe strikes a pose too.\nThanks to that, my face turns red.\n“So cute!”\n“Ugh.”\nI’ve been found out.\nI didn’t even realize Rena was here.\nDid she swap places with Han Si-hu?\n“Yeah, yeah, it’s okay. It’s okay, so what? It’s good, isn’t it?”\nDid I get caught mimicking the anime?\nI’m going to high school soon, you know?\nI just wanted to see Seo-ah striking poses like this.\nI couldn’t even imagine it.\nWell, in terms of height or growth, she doesn’t seem like a high school student.\nMaybe she didn’t grow well because she didn’t eat enough.\nIt’s also possible she doesn’t know her exact age.\nShe lost her parents when she was young.\n“Want to try again?”\n“Again?”\n“I’ll do it with you. Let’s show Si-hu when he comes later!”\nIt’s hard to refuse with her sparkling eyes.\nShe wants to play together, isn’t that what friends do?\nI think that’s not a bad idea.\nAlthough showing it to Si-hu feels ambiguous.\n“W-why Si-hu?”\n“Don’t be shy. You were practicing, right? Smiling and greeting. It’s similar to that.”\nWas I caught?\nWell, I’ve been doing that in my room every day.\n“You’re already good at smiling. You just need confidence. Forget everything that happened before.”\n“......”\n“We need times like this. We can’t always be down. You don’t have to feel burdened. I just like seeing you play.”\nThe atmosphere has been quite down.\nThat’s why I practiced smiling.\nI can’t bring out the ideal Yoo Seo-ah that Han Si-hu wants.\nI tried practicing, but I couldn’t achieve a pure smile.\nReturning to the past is impossible.\n“Si-hu worries all the time. If you both are in that state, it hurts me too. I want to see you showing a side where you can play like this.”\n“Is that so…”\n“Okay, I’ll play the role of Sapphire!”\nWhat’s Sapphire?\nIs it the protagonist’s name?\nShe seems to know quite a bit.\n“I used to play like this with my little sister. It’s nostalgic.”\nShe seems family-oriented.\nI felt it when I dressed her properly and wrapped new bandages around her.\nShe had a little sister.\n“…I am the one who will save the world…”\nAs we play in sync, the goal shifts.\nI’m not mimicking a character; I’m creating a new one.\nMaybe it’s the drug’s effect, but I’m getting more absorbed in the play.\n“Right, right, that’s the feeling. Good.”\nThis might serve as an excuse for having the bandages wrapped around my arm.\nIf someone at the academy asks, it could be troublesome.\nIf I’m a character doing weird things because of chuunibyou, they’d probably understand.\nIt’s a good way to revive an active side while offsetting the dark image of the bandages.\nThere aren’t any characters overlapping with my memory concept.\nI’ll show a side filled with pretense and self-indulgence.\nYep, my left hand is sealed with a black dragon.\nIt’s true.\nCan I legally have this kind of concept while playing?\nI can’t forget the startled look on Han Si-hu when he returned to the dorm.\nThe eye patch was something Han Si-hu bought me later.\nI’m glad we could play together.\n[47 minutes]\nThe thing in the corner of my vision is just a bit bothersome.",

      "content": "Immediately after entering the academy, we undergo the entrance test.\nIt’s basically a time to learn about the abilities of our classmates.\nIt’s also when the hierarchy gets roughly established.\nThis is the time when Han Si-hu would be devouring everything.\n“You can’t just attack anyone like last time.”\n“Okay.”\nHere, it’s just Lee Yoo-ram and me.\nThe training ground is spacious but a closed-off space.\nThere are spectator seats beyond the glass windows.\nOriginally, our classmates would be gathered there to watch.\nBut if we’re talking about classmates, I’m the only one.\nI thought they would add a few more to the special class, but I didn’t expect there would be no one.\n“Do you understand?”\n“Yes.”\nI’m also holding back on the concept play here.\nI’ve put away the eye patch and spoken normally.\nDoing this is quite tiring.\nStill, it helps to block people from approaching.\n“Okay.”\n—Whoosh.\n[13 hours 25 minutes]\nThe effects of the drugs are starting to kick in.\nA pleasurable sensation flows through my nervous system.\nAfter hesitating over the pleasure for a moment, the surrounding environment becomes vividly clear.\nWhat should I attack?\n“You need to distinguish who the enemy is. If you attack an ally like last time, it will really be a problem this time.”\n—Crackle.\nLee Yoo-ram brought an old MP3 player.\nI have no idea how it relates to the drugs.\n“It’s a bit old, but it should be fine.”\nHe presses a button with a thud.\nVoices come through with a crackling noise.\n—Please listen after administration.\n—Repeating it is effective.\n—Psychological stability is not necessary for the test subject.\n—It lasts only while the drug is effective.\nStrange words spill out.\nWhat on earth is this voice for?\n—[You cannot attack a target not designated by your superior.]\nLee Yoo-ram looks at me with a peculiar expression.\nIt seems he’s unsure if this will work.\n—[You must attack the target designated by your superior.]\n“Hmm?”\nI feel like I’ve heard that voice somewhere.\nIt’s a familiar voice.\nHow many voices would Yoo Seo-ah be familiar with?\nThe doctor?\nMy memory is hazy, but didn’t a similar situation occur?\nWhat did he say after administering the drugs?\nThat I must tell the truth, wasn’t it?\nIt must have been right after I went to Han Si-hu.\n—[You are designated to...]\nThud.\n“That's enough.”\nLee Yoo-ram turns off the sound.\nI was curious about what came next, but it’s a pity.\n“This much is sufficient.”\nAn old MP3 player.\nI don’t know whose voice is recorded, but it clearly has some effect.\n“Now, create a dagger. That’s your ability, right?”\n“Yes.”\nThud.\nA black dagger is gripped in my hand.\nThis time, I don’t feel any murderous intent rising.\n“Do you see that scarecrow over there?”\n“Yes.”\nAbout ten steps away, a scarecrow appears.\nDid it rise from the ground?\nThe training ground really has all kinds of functions.\n“Attack.”\nAttack.\nBoom!\nThe black dagger expands explosively.\nIt stretches toward the scarecrow like branches.\nIt resembles a massive tree root rather than a blade.\nThis is more violent than the last time when I let the blade droop during the attack.\n[11 hours 20 minutes]\nI can see the black roots sticking into the scarecrow.\n[10 hours 51 minutes]\n“Disperse.”\nI’m horrified at the sight of time melting away, and I dispel the weapon.\nIt shatters like glass, and the fragments dissolve into the air.\nIt seems I don’t harbor hatred toward the scarecrow.\nLast time, I was quite flustered because my weapon didn’t disappear.\n“Was that your intention?”\n“I just attacked on a whim.”\n“I see. Good job.”\nLee Yoo-ram writes something on a piece of paper he brought.\nHe said it was a skill test.\nI wonder if I can get a good score.\nOther academy students are probably taking tests in different training areas.\nI want to watch too.\n“Can you do long-range attacks?”\n“Long-range…?”\nThat’s something I hadn’t thought of.\nLet’s give it a try.\nI have no clue how to do it, though.\nShould I make a bow and shoot?\nThat doesn’t seem likely.\n“Want to try long-range attack this time? It might work.”\nAs Lee Yoo-ram snaps his fingers, a new scarecrow appears.\nThis one appeared from a distance.\nIt’s definitely out of reach for close combat.\nBut for Han Si-hu, he could swing his sword and hit it.\nOnce you reach a certain level, the distinction between close and long-range attacks loses its meaning.\n“Long-range attack.”\nO drug, give me a gun.\nThen a pistol appears.\nIt looks rough, with no real details.\nIt resembles something carved from wood.\n“Bang.”\nI pulled the trigger, but nothing happened.\nThere’s no barrel and no bullets.\nIf it actually shot, that would be more surprising.\n“There are awakened people who can shoot guns, but… it seems it doesn’t work.”\n“Is that so?”\n“Then I’ll have to register it as a close-range attack. I won’t use any weapons.”\nLee Yoo-ram requested a long-range attack.\nI have an obligation to meet that expectation.\nIf I throw the gun, would that also count as a long-range attack?\nIsn’t there something cooler?\nLike the attacks I’ve seen in animations.\nSwinging a wand and shooting out dazzling lasers.\nThe wand might not be suitable.\nShooting lasers is intriguing.\n“Bang.”\nAgain, nothing particularly happens.\nI thought it would work.\n“Honestly, it’s normal for it not to work. This isn’t a drug that enables long-range attacks.”\n“Aha.”\nIf I change the drugs, can I do long-range attacks?\nJust how versatile are they?\nI don’t understand why people don’t use them.\nI’d like to see someone else using it at least once.\n“Don’t you see levels or skill names displayed before your eyes? Some people call it the status window.”\nGlance.\n[10 hours 48 minutes]\nIs this also a status window?\nI’ve been using it effectively.\n“I don’t see anything.”\n“Is that so? That must be tricky.”\n“Are there awakened people like me who can’t see such things?”\n“Yeah. When the awakening rate is low.”\nI remember mine being quite low.\n“You’ve forcibly raised it by using drugs, so it’s not strange for it to look abnormal.”\n“Abnormal…”\nWhat does that mean?\nDoes it mean I’m abnormal?\nOr does it refer to this [10 hours 47 minutes] that appears to be abnormal?\nI don’t know.\n“Do you have any other abilities?”\nOther abilities?\nI think there was something.\nThud.\nI create a dagger.\nThis is the ability I’ve had since I started taking the special drugs.\nThere must have been some ability from the beginning.\nMy ability shouldn’t just be limited to creating black blades.\nRight?\n[10 hours 39 minutes]\n“You can do anything.”\nAnything?\nI spread my left palm and look at it.\nIt’s wrapped in bandages.\n“You’re testing your limits.”\nI know my limits roughly.\nAs long as time doesn’t hit [0], it’s fine.\nThat’s my limit.\nWhoosh.\n“The testing area is wide, so… huh?”\nI stabbed my hand.\nI plunged the dagger into my left hand, which was spread out before me.\nIt wasn’t difficult to pierce through.\nBlood oozes out.\n[10 hours 11 minutes]\n“This way.”\nEven if my arm breaks, it doesn’t hurt, and getting stabbed by a blade doesn’t hurt either.\nI’m just afraid of the effects wearing off.\nBut it’s fine right now.\nIt’s not a fatal injury, and Lee Yoo-ram is a healing-type awakened, and the environment is perfect with an abundance of drugs.\n“It doesn’t hurt. This is the ability I originally had.”\nI say as I pull out the blade.\nThe blade I removed shatters in the air as it disappears.\nThe bandages are being stained red.\n[9 hours 56 minutes]\nPain?\nRather, there’s a strange pleasure in it.\nIt’s not that I used to play around by cutting my arms out of boredom for no reason.\nWith Han Si-hu gone, I felt lonely by myself.\n“…Don’t do that.”\n“Yes.”\nI only did it to test the limits of my ability.\nLee Yoo-ram holds my bleeding hand.\n[9 hours 44 minutes]\n“[Lesser Heal].”\nThe wound instantly heals.\n“Wow.”\n[9 hours 43 minutes]\nThe rapid loss of time has also stopped.\nThis is why you keep a healer by your side.\nHe’s a precious asset.\n“You don’t have any other abilities, right? Speak, speak, don’t harm yourself.”\n“I don’t think so.”\n“Alright.”\nLee Yoo-ram writes something down on the paper.\nHe grumbles about what he’ll make me do because he’s scared.\nHis hands seem to be trembling a bit.\n“…There’s still the trauma test left. We skipped it last time.”\nI’ve heard of that test.\nIt’s the one Han Si-hu told me not to do.\nIt sounds like a dangerous name.\n“Let’s give it a try. We have to do it at least once. It’s to check your resistance to mental attacks.”\nIf other students are doing it,\nthere’s no reason not to do it.\n“I’ll do it.”\n“Okay. Switching to the trauma test. If it seems too difficult, I’ll stop right away. You can say stop, and it’ll be stopped immediately.”\n“Yes.”\nWas it about evoking bad memories?\nShowing hallucinations?\nI remember it being something similar.\n“It’s about mental confusion or hallucinations, something like that… those who can’t handle it won’t be affected at all. Then it’s an instant pass. It means you won’t crumble under ordinary mental attacks.”\n“Is that so?”\n“Are you ready? It’s better to start quickly and finish it. Overthinking can be poisonous.”\nLee Yoo-ram takes a step back.\nHe snaps his fingers holding a pen.\n“Here we go.”\nBoom.\nWith a loud noise, everything around me flies away.\nFor a hallucination, it feels extremely real.\nA black space unfolds.\nIt’s silent.\n“…They said it was a mental attack.”\nWith everything around being dark, it feels a bit scary.\nI can’t hear anything.\nNot even the sound of my own heartbeat.\nIt’s too quiet.\nI won’t crumble under this level of fear.\nThis is nothing.\n“That’s…”\nThere’s something.\nSomeone is there.\n“…It’s Han Si-hu.”\nThe scenery changes abruptly.\nI see a gloomy sky as if it’s about to rain.\nA house that looks like it’s about to collapse.\nIn the middle of a slum.\nOld memories are replayed.",

      "content": "I feel strange.\nEven knowing that this is a hallucination.\nMy vision spins.\nAt some point, I find myself blankly staring up at the sky.\nIt’s a gloomy sky.\nAm I sitting on the concrete floor because my legs have given out?\nI’m propped up with one hand on the ground.\nMy head tilts back slightly as I look up at the sky.\nI don’t recall changing my position, but it feels like I’ve been in this posture for quite some time.\nThe academy's technology is quite impressive.\nI heard that if I shout “stop,” it will end.\nBut for now, everything seems fine.\nI turn my head to check my surroundings.\nI’m inside a house.\nHan Si-hu is outside on the street.\nIs it that day?\nThe day I thought I shouldn’t let Han Si-hu inside my house.\nThis was before my will intervened.\nWhat could I have changed?\nIf Seo-ah had asked Han Si-hu for help, would things have been different?\nNothing would have changed.\nKnock, knock.\nI hear the sound of Han Si-hu knocking on the door.\nI could just open the door.\nI could tell him to come in.\nI could invite him to play together.\nLike before.\n“Ah…”\nThat’s not possible.\nLook at the state of the house.\nHow many drugs have I taken?\nEmpty syringes are scattered on the floor.\nThe medicine bottles are all empty.\nI remember now.\nI used every drug I could before dying.\nI was scared.\nHanging myself with a rope is terrifying.\nStabbing myself with a knife is terrifying.\nBut living in this state is even scarier.\nI prop myself up with one hand on the floor.\nIn my other hand, I hold a small kitchen knife.\nWhat was I planning to do with it?\nIt’s not for cooking.\n“Yoo Seo-ah.”\nHan Si-hu knocks on the door.\nHis voice is close.\nI can feel he’s standing outside.\nHere, Yoo Seo-ah plays the role of coldly rejecting him.\nI send him away with a stream of curses.\nI can’t let him see.\nIf he comes in, everything will be exposed.\nDeep down, I feel happy.\nThe feeling that Han Si-hu hasn’t forgotten me.\nBut immediately after, I reflect on what I’ve done.\nLooking at the scattered syringes.\n“Open the door.”\nHis tone is aggressive.\nWas he always like this?\nI need to stop him from opening the door.\nHow?\nMy body feels weak.\nI can’t even muster the strength to speak.What’s the right choice?\nAfter all, this is just a hallucination.\nIt must be a simulation or something similar.\nIt’s pulling out bad memories from the past.\nBut I don’t think this level of memory is problematic.\nI don’t see it as a painful memory.\n“Open the door.”\nIf he wants to, Han Si-hu could break through the door.\nHe could leap over the fence.\nHe could smash through the wall.\nThe reason he doesn’t is out of respect for Yoo Seo-ah.\nThe house is a sanctuary.\nIt’s better for both of us if he doesn’t come in.\n“I’m coming in.”\nIt unfolds differently than I remember.\nThe dialogue is a bit different, though.\nShould I respond somehow?\nI’m not perfectly recreating that time.\nA memory from the past?\nIt’s all fake anyway, so is it really okay?\nIf Han Si-hu intends to barge in without hesitation, I have no way to stop him.\nCreak.\nThe door is ripped off its hinges.\nYeah, that’s how it is.\nI can’t stop this.\n“Just as I expected.”\nHan Si-hu, holding a sword, speaks.\nThis diverges from my memories.\nI’ve never seen a scene like this.\nHe’s hostile.\nI’ve never realized he could look at Yoo Seo-ah that way.\nEven if it’s just a hallucination, it feels threatening.\n“Couldn’t even die properly.”\nHan Si-hu wanders around the yard and picks up a rope.\nThe clumsily tied knot feels familiar.\n“Are you thinking of living on like this, like a parasite?”\nHe casually throws the rope while speaking.\nThese words sound like something Han Si-hu would never say.\n“It’s best for everyone. Dying here would be the most efficient. It’s unfortunate, but…”\nThis isn’t the real Han Si-hu.\nBut it feels strangely familiar.\nI’ve felt something similar somewhere before.\n“Isn’t there a problem?”\nHan Si-hu mutters to himself.\n“…The doctor? They can handle it at the academy anyway. Most of the key figures don’t even know about Yoo Seo-ah’s existence…”\nHe seems to be contemplating something.\nI feel like I’ve seen this expression before.\n“But can I really not kill you with my own hands?”\nHan Si-hu steps closer to Yoo Seo-ah.\nHe wears a slight smile.\nIt’s an expression that suggests everything is going according to plan.\nIt’s clear that he’s not the Han Si-hu I know.\nBut why does this feel so familiar?\nHis unique way of thinking is comforting.\nThe dialogue feels familiar.\n“There’s karma here. It’s also called karma, and as long as I don’t kill you with my own hands, it should be fine.”\nHe doesn’t intend to dirty his own hands.\nBut he wants Yoo Seo-ah to die.\n“It would have been convenient if you had just overdosed on the drugs. Is there no remaining medicine?”\nHe kicks the scattered syringes.\n“If someone comes and raises questions, it’ll be bothersome. The best way is for you to just die on your own.”\nI’m beginning to have an idea of who it might be.\nIt’s not Han Si-hu but rather the protagonist.It’s something I’ve always thought.\nI want to be the protagonist.\nSo what would the protagonist have done?\nIf I had been in Han Si-hu’s position.\nIt’s not impossible that I would have done something like that.\nEfficiently, heading towards success, eliminating everything that gets in the way.\n“Don’t look at me with those eyes. You think it’s better to end up like this, don’t you?”\nI stagger as I rise from my spot.\nI still have the kitchen knife in my hand.\n“Are you planning to attack me?”\nHan Si-hu speaks with a smile.\n“If I’m gone, you’ll be too. The world will likely perish as well. Right?”\nThat look is like…\nWhat should I say?\n“Let’s go with efficiency.”\nHe snaps his fingers.\nFlames burst forth.\n“I just want to burn down this place. It’ll serve as practice for my [Fire] skills.”\nHan Si-hu shouldn’t have fire skills.\nHe probably obtained them through some trick.\nThe story wouldn’t flow like this.\nThe Han Si-hu in this hallucination feels more like a protagonist than I do.\nHe seems to know much more than I do.\nHe embodies the extreme of the efficiency I’ve desired.\nThe protagonist who is running towards the goal.\n“Like this.”\nSnap.\nWith the sound of fingers snapping, flames rise.\nThere are precious belongings in the house.\nI’ve disposed of most, but a few things I haven’t managed to clear out remain in the drawers.\nI can’t let them burn.\nStop.\nIf I say stop, the test will end.\nStop.\nWords don’t come out.\nNo matter what, this is wrong.\n“The slum is nice for things like this. Even if it gets messy, no one cares.”\nHan Si-hu speaks with delight.\n“Anyway, it’s going to rain soon. You won’t catch a cold.”\nThat’s right.\nIt’ll rain from this gloomy sky soon.\nBut right now, it’s very different.\nThe situation is very different.\n“…This isn’t personal hatred.”\nHan Si-hu stands beside me and speaks.\n“You know. If you had been in good condition, I would have tried to save you… but it’s too late. It’s not right to let unnecessary emotions intervene. You’re already too late.”\nIt’s too late for Yoo Seo-ah to be treated.\nThat’s certainly true.\nHearing it from someone else feels strange.\nIt’s true.\nI knew it was true myself.\n“It’s delusional to believe that you can be treated. Look at you. You’re just using drugs because you want to drown in pleasure. Living on will only be a burden to others.”\nI know.\nI understand that I’m a nuisance.\n“So let’s end it here. It’s better for everyone, and it’ll be cleaner. As much as you can’t do it, I will.”\nIf Han Si-hu can do it,\nthen it should be okay without me.\nAll this time, I’ve been muttering that I’m a hindrance, that I’m trash, all alone.\nStill, I acted as if I deserved to live.\nBecause people treated me well.\nBecause they played with me.\n“You know what the right choice is.”\nHe says while looking at the burning house.\nLeaving no traces of Yoo Seo-ah behind.\nNot becoming a hindrance to the protagonist.\nWhat the protagonist desires is what I desire.\nBecause I am the protagonist.\nIf I were the protagonist, I would want Yoo Seo-ah to disappear.\nIf I became her, then it would be hypocrisy to change my mind.\nEfficiency, a straight path toward the goal.\n“Yeah. You thought well.”\nIsn’t this the right choice?\nAfter all, thanks to the drugs, it doesn’t hurt.\nI was trying to summon courage.\nThe blade touches my neck.\nI finish it myself.\nWithout relying on someone else.\nThe method that would help Han Si-hu the most.\nThe way to offer assistance.\nBang!\n“-Stop. 8 minutes and 56 seconds.”\nLee Yoo-ram halted the test.\nThe surrounding environment returns to normal.\n[2 hours 12 minutes]\nTime has significantly decreased.\nA black blade is gripped in my hand.\n“Ah...”\nSo this was the kind of test.\nMy mind feels a bit clearer.\nI feel strange.\n“Are you okay?”\nI truly feel strange.\nI dispel the knife that was in my hand.\n[2 hours 11 minutes]\nThat was dangerous.\nIn the hallucination, time was invisible.\n“…Are you okay? Even if it stopped, this is a pass.”\nBut it seems that what Han Si-hu said might be correct.\n“Was the intensity of the test too strong?”\nI shouldn’t become a hindrance to the protagonist.\nBeing unable to disappear on my own is just silly.\nInstead of just saying it, I need to show it through my actions.\nBut I’ve already hindered him.\nSo I need to provide some help.\n—Whoosh.\n[11 hours 21 minutes]\n“Ahaha...”\nI feel better.\nI had only been thinking negatively.\nPeople need to live positively.\n“Are you okay?”\n“Yes.”\nLee Yoo-ram places the file folder on the desk.\n“The pain tolerance test... isn’t necessary, reaction speed, concentration... it’s okay not to do them... monster processing by grade... let’s skip that. Today is done.”\n“Is that it?”\n“Yeah. Other classes will probably take a long time. There are many people, and they need to explain the system.”\n“Aha.”\nIs it the system that runs the academy?\nSince I’m in a special class, it probably doesn’t have much meaning to explain to me.\n“You got reassigned to a new dorm, right? The drug delivery will go there directly, so make sure to receive it well.”\n“Yes.”\nI’ll receive the drugs without going through Han Si-hu.\nThat’s better.\n“If the drugs are insufficient or if something goes wrong, contact me immediately. Did you receive the device? Yeah. That one. You can contact emergency services by pressing this button...”\nHan Si-hu registered several numbers on the device.\nHan Si-hu.\nBecause of what happened earlier, it feels like an image has been overlayed over him.\nI think I understand how terrifying mental attacks can be.\nDo other students go through something similar?\nI feel a sense of respect.",

      "content": "Before leaving the training ground, there’s something I need to do.\nI put on my eye patch and wrap the bandages tightly.\nThis way, I can feel more at ease.\nI don’t want to run into the people who used to hit me back then at the academy.\nIt would be best if they couldn’t recognize me, even if we crossed paths.\nThe academy is a particularly large building.\nIt’s where all sorts of training grounds are gathered.\nI think it’s unlikely that I’ll run into them, but you never know what life has in store.\n“Can I use the training ground anytime?”\n“It’s usually fine, but Seo-ah, you need your meds. It’s better if you report to me before you go.”\nThat seems to be the case.\n“I’m temporarily in charge of the special class, so I don’t know if the teachers will change, but until then, just let me know.”\n“Yes.”\n“Try not to get too involved with other students, alright?”\nI nod.\nI don’t really want to get involved anyway.\nTalking to people is exhausting in itself.\n[11 hours 13 minutes]\nI can’t waste any time.\n“Anyway, morning classes are over. You can come back here after lunch.”\n“To the training ground?”\n“Yeah.”\nThe classes have ended.\nMore specifically, the tests have.\n“While you’re out, if you feel like something might go wrong, you know what to do, right? Contact me immediately.”\nI don’t think anything will go wrong.\nAfter saying goodbye to Lee Yoo-ram, I leave the training ground.\nI feel good walking around alone for the first time in a while.\nOr maybe it’s just that the effects of the drugs are still lingering.\n[11 hours 5 minutes]\nI’m not that hungry.\nI’d be satisfied with just a can of tuna.\nNow, where should I buy food?\nThe restaurant district I went to with Han Si-hu last time sounds good.\nThere are restaurants inside the building, but I’d rather eat outside.\nThe air outside definitely feels better.\nEven though it’s class time, I see a few students out here.\nThey seem to be upperclassmen.\nThere’s one person who stands out.\nA boy with white hair.\n“…Who is that?”\nI quickly turn off my path and hide behind a nearby pillar.\nWho could that be?\nThe figure is definitely someone lingering in my memory.\nWhite hair.\n-That white-haired brat...\nWhen was that memory from?\nWho said that?\nI distinctly remember someone saying it.\nI’ve never seen someone with white hair before.\n-Why did that white-haired brat send so many watchers?\nI remember that.\nMy stomach churns.\nThe culprit behind the beating I took for something trivial.\nHow hard did they hit me for me to have gotten bruised like that?\nI’m fine now, but it hurt a lot back then.\nThey hit me while talking about humanoid watchers.\nI’m glad the doctor saved me.\nBut the one who hit me wasn’t the white-haired boy.\nSo there’s no reason to hide.\nI know that logically.\nBut still, I feel uneasy.\nHowever, standing still behind the pillar feels strange.\nI should do something.\nI pull out my device.\n[Han Si-hu: Let’s have lunch together.]\nEating together?\nRight, it’s much better than eating alone.\nMaybe I acted a bit too antisocial.\nI really don’t have any friends.\nIt seems my wish to make friends at the academy won’t come true.\nSince I’m isolated in the special class.\n[Yeah.]\nIt’s good to eat together.\n[I’ll be at the restaurant district.]\nI should go since I need to eat something.\nIt should be fine.\n“You.”\nSomething unexpected happened.\nThe white-haired boy speaks to me.\nIf I answer “What?” it’ll break my character.\n“…What is it?”\nI quickly adjust my tone.\n“Are you a new student?”\nThe white-haired boy stands up.\nGiven that he’s asking if I’m a new student, he must be at least in the second year.\n“That’s right.”\n“I thought you might know me.”\n“What do you mean?”\nHe’s a strange one.\nIt might have been better to just avoid him.\nI didn’t expect him to talk to me.\nThe warning about how there are many weird people at the academy echoes in my ears.\n“Hey, you see that pigeon over there?”\nHe walks closer and points to the streetlight above.\nA pigeon is sitting there.\n“That one saw you hiding.”\nIs that what a watcher is?\nThis is why awakened ones are troublesome.\nThey can do all sorts of unexpected things.\nI never imagined they would use pigeons for surveillance.\n-…Beware of the watchers?\n-But you hit me just enough that it should be fine.\n-Who was it that warned me about humanoid watchers?\nThe conversations from that time come flooding back.\nI don’t feel good about it.\n“…I don’t know what you’re talking about.”\n“It’s strange for a new student to be wandering around at this time.”\nI finished early just because I’m in the special class.\n“Hey, with the eye patch and bandages, and your speech...”\nHe seems to ponder for a moment.\n“You’re a pretty pitiful kid.”\nHe places his hand on my head.\nThe look on his face is one of pity.\nI try to shove him away, but my hand doesn’t move.\nIs this for real?\n-[You cannot attack a target not designated by a superior.]\nIs that what it meant?\n“Hang in there.”\nTap, tap.\nHe pats my head as if to cheer me on.\nDoes he think it’s okay since I’m just sitting still?\n“I heard that girls dislike being patted. You’re not mad, are you?”\nThat’s not the issue.\nI can’t attack.\nIf I try to swing my arms, it feels like they’re weighed down by heavy metal.\nIs it better than going on a rampage and smashing everything?\nStill, this seems like a problem.\nHow long is this going to last?\nI’m sure I heard something about it.\n-[You cannot attack a target not designated by a superior.]\nThere was a line that played before this sentence appeared, like an explanation.\n-[It only lasts as long as the drug’s effects.]\nAs long as the drug’s effects last.\nThen it’ll be over when the effects wear off.\n[10 hours 53 minutes]\nThe effects need to keep lasting, though?\nThis isn’t good.\nI think I need to find a way.\nAt this rate, I can’t resist and will just have to endure.\n“…What are you doing?”\nI really don’t know what he’s doing.\nIsn’t it rude to act this way to someone you’ve just met?\n“What’s your name? I’m Seol Ha-jin.”\nHe seems to have become a bit friendlier.\n“You don’t need to know mine.”\n“The problem is that they bring even sick kids to the academy.”\nHe seems to think I’m a sick kid, so he’s being a bit lenient.\nThat’s true.\nBut it’s not like I’m mentally sick.\n“The academy isn’t a place that shows concern for the weak.”\nHis expression becomes serious.\nAt this point, it feels like he doesn’t care how I respond.\nHe’s just saying what he wants.\nHe clearly sees me as weak.\n“Alright.”\nHe grabs my hand and starts walking towards the restaurant district.\n“Ah, um...”\n“No, it’s fine. I’ll buy everything, so eat something delicious. What do you want?”\n“......”\nI don’t even know what to say.\nIt would have been better to keep my character short, but thinking long just gives me a headache.\nI was just planning to chase people away.\nSeol Ha-jin seems to feel closer to me instead.\nSince this has happened, should I try to be friends?\nBut that doesn’t seem right either.\n“There's no need to refuse. I’m the senior treating you.”\nI tried to get up from my seat, but failed.\nHe grabbed my shoulder.\n“Choose. Whatever you want.”\nBad memories start to resurface.\nI was originally misunderstood because of this guy.\nHe wasn’t the one who hit me; it was someone else.\n“I really don’t need it. I have someone to eat with...”\nI sigh as I say that.\n“You don’t have to avoid me that much.”\n“Ugh.”\nHe casually drapes an arm over my shoulder.\nWhat a jerk.\nI can’t help but say this is a jerk move.\nI recall Lee Yoo-ram’s advice to avoid getting too involved with others.\nHe probably worried about this happening.\n“I’m just trying to help my pitiful junior—”\nThud.\nA dull sound.\nSeol Ha-jin gets knocked down by a punch.\n“What are you doing to someone else's friend? Seol Ha-jin.”\nIt’s Han Si-hu.\nDid they know each other?\nIt doesn’t seem like they’re close since he immediately threw a punch.\n“Han Si-hu? What are you doing…”\nHe stands up with a pained expression.\nHan Si-hu looks angrier than I expected.\nHe’s not the type to throw punches right away.\n“Hey, this is my lunch companion.”\n“…Oh, I see.”\nSeol Ha-jin looks at Han Si-hu in surprise.\n“Is that so?”\nHe says it like it’s a mere afterthought.\n“Did you come from the slums too?”\nHe says it while looking at me, rather than Han Si-hu.\nHe seems to smile as if it’s amusing.\nI wonder how he found out.\n“Yeah, so stop messing around and get lost.”\nBefore he kills him.\nI can hear Han Si-hu grinding his teeth angrily.\nHe seems to be quite furious.",

      "content": "If there is hell in this world, it would be here.\nInside the dormitory.\nIn my room.\nRight here, right now.\n[12 minutes]\nMy lunch with Han Si-hoo was delicious.\nThe mention of the slums quickly faded away along with Seol Ha-jin.\nI heard that Han Si-hoo was a student from the high school division whom I had beaten in a sparring match when he was in the middle school division.\nNo wonder he looked displeased.\nThe afternoon class with Lee Yu-ram was also beneficial.\nHowever, this command of mine refuses to go away.\nI can't attack unless the target is designated by a superior.\nWith this in place, my planned strategy takes a significant hit.\nIf it weren't for Seol Ha-jin, I think it would have taken me longer to notice this issue.\nBut I found a solution.\nAs soon as it reaches zero, I will use the drug.\nThe moment it hits zero.\nEven if I feel like I want to die, I can hold out for a brief moment.\nI already feel an unpleasant sensation as if bugs are crawling all over my body, but there's nothing I can do about it.\nIt can't be helped.\nThe only way to break this command that says something about following the orders of a superior is this.\nI’ll lower the effect of the drug.\nPreviously, it seemed like the command set by the doctor was lifted after I barely escaped death last time.\nSo, this is the only way.\nBlood seeps from the wound on my wrist.\n“Just a little more.”\nI cut my own arm.\nWhen blood flows, the effect of the drug decreases faster.\nBut if it decreases too quickly, that would be a problem, so I adjusted the speed a bit.\nIf I don't want to see blood, I could strangle myself or use another method.\nBut this seemed the easiest way.\n[7 minutes]\nAs the drug effect wears off, the pain becomes sharper.\nI was clearly born to suffer.\nThat's the only thought I have.\n“Not yet.”\nShould I just give up?\nFour empty syringes lie on the desk.\nThis is the fourth attempt.\nIf I go any further, I'll run out of syringes to use.\n[4 minutes]\n“Now.”\nBang!\nI hit my finger with the hammer I had prepared.\nI know this will make the time evaporate by about five minutes instantly.\nIt hurts.\n[0]\nAt the same time, I have to insert the syringe right away.\nLast time, I failed with about a minute left.\n[4 hours 13 minutes]\nGot it.\nMy hand is a bit bruised, but this time it seems to be a success.\nA bandage is still essential.\n“Hah, ha.”\nI’m out of breath.\nIt feels like I've gone to the threshold of hell and back.\nI'd rather die than endure without the drug effect.\n“It's done. Anyway.”\nI immediately apply pressure to the bleeding wrist.\nIf I had the medical supplies sold at the academy, I could stop the bleeding quickly.\nI wash it a bit with water, and now I just need to wrap the bandage properly.\nThat's the advantage of a personal dormitory.\nNo one cares what I do alone.\n“Playing pretend... I can't ask to loosen the bandages...”\nWhile I’m at the academy, I guess I’ll have to keep fooling around like this.\nIt’s a good excuse for the bandages.\nIf Han Si-hoo and Lena find out, it would be bothersome.\nBoth of them see me as a friend.\nI'm grateful for their concern, but it's a bit annoying at the same time.\n“Should I ask Lee Yu-ram to treat me?”\nThat seems like it could be quite a nuisance.\nIf they ask why I got hurt, it would be bothersome.\nEven if I said I was self-harming for fun, I feel like Lee Yu-ram would just accept it.\nTime.\n[4 hours 11 minutes]\nNot that, real time.\n7:46 AM.\nIt’s morning.\nTime to head to school.\nI stayed up all night trying to remove the drug effect.\nBut since I succeeded, it’s fine.\nHow dare they impose such restrictions on me?\nI can attack as I please.\nI have freedom.\nFreedom.\n“Alright, morning class starts.”\nLee Yu-ram presses the button.\nAlong with the crackling noise, a voice is heard.\nFreedom?\nIt’s another repetitive day.\n-Please listen after administration.\n-Repeating it is effective.\n-Subjects do not need psychological reassurance.\n-It will only last as long as the drug effect persists.\nThe same repetitive voice again.\nI tried to cover my ears.\nBut at Lee Yu-ram's words that I couldn't administer the drug like that, I lowered my hands.\n-[You cannot attack a target not designated by a superior.]\nWhat a load of crap.\n-[You must attack the target designated by a superior.]\nI need to find a way.\nNo, there’s a way, but I thought it would be over with just once.\nI never expected to hear this every time I used the drug.\n“Ahaha.”\nI can’t help but laugh.\nI feel happy.\nTeacher?\nTeacher, what would happen if the sentence coming from that MP3 player were a bit different?\nIt seems too versatile.\nCan it command anything?\nEven so, there must be some limitations.\n“Other class kids are starting to head into actual combat. We should prepare too.”\n“Actual combat?”\n“The goal is to eliminate monsters. Cleansing dungeons or gates, that’s what the academy is for.”\n“Is that something I’m supposed to do?”\nThat’s the job of academy students.\nBut are they sending me too?\n“At least once.”\nAt least once?\nOnce is once.\nThis wording is strange.\n“What should I do?”\n“We need to prepare first. We’re going to practice fighting against actual monsters, not simulations. In the training ground.”\nI’ve always wanted to fight properly at least once.\nBecause that’s what academy students do.\n“If the results are good, you’ll be able to fight outside too.”\n“I can't fight for long.”\nIf the drug is sufficient, I can fight.\nBut based on my past combat experience, I can only do short-term battles.Quick and decisive.\nUntil the drug effect wears off.\n“Then use one more.”\n“Huh?”\n“Military drug. It will get stronger the more you use it.”\n“Wow.”\nLee Yu-ram pulls out one more syringe.\n[13 hours 58 minutes]\nAm I getting one more shot here?\nThis is the best.\nMy mind is racing.\n-Swoosh.\n[21 hours 14 minutes]\nIt’s been a long time since I’ve gone over 20 hours.\n“Haha.”\n“Are you okay?”\n“I’m fine.”\nWhat if I use just one more?\n“Okay, then again. Attack the target. It should be stronger than the last scarecrow.”\nIf they say to attack, then I should do it.\nI get closer to the target.\nIt looks like a steel pillar.\nFirst, I create a handle, then form the head of the hammer.\nI swing it.\n[20 hours 2 minutes]\nIt’s a one-hour weapon.\nBang.\nThe target cracks.\nIf it were a scarecrow, it would have already broken.\nBang bang bang.\nI recall the bruise on my finger.\nWhile I was suffering through that, I had dropped the drug's effect.\nWhy am I obeying commands again?\nCrack.\nSo it seems I unconsciously gripped the hammer.\n[15 hours 36 minutes]\nThe target shattered.\n“The method of attack has changed. Can you freely create weapons?”\n“I don’t know.”\nIt seems I can create weapons I’ve used once.\nOr maybe weapons I’ve experienced fighting against.\nSword, awl, hammer, scissors...\n“Now that I have a rough idea of its power, how long can I fight like this?”\n“About 5 minutes? 3 minutes? It could be even less.”\n“Then I can just keep using drugs whenever I fall short.”\n“Ah, huh? Yes, that's right.”\nI guess they’re planning to give me the drugs.\nThat’s good for me.\nI know the drugs are expensive.\nWill there be any left if they just give them away?\n“You can keep using them. Yes. You’ve already exceeded the lethal dose, after all. Since you chose to stay at the academy.”\n“Lethal dose?”\n“If an ordinary animal were to take this much, it would die quickly. While the lethal dose varies from person to person... using too much is dangerous, regardless.”\nI didn't die.\n[15 hours 33 minutes]\nI’m fine.\nWithout the drug, I would die.\nAh, that’s it.\nIf I use drugs without being a patient, that could be a problem.\nBut since I am a patient, there’s no problem.\nHow much do they think I’ve used?\nI won’t die from this much.\n\"That's beside the point. Have you ever killed a monster?\"\n\"Monster?\"\n\"It doesn't matter what you call it. Have you ever caught one?\"\nDid I?\nI saw Han Si-hoo kill one.\nI don't know if Yu Seo-ah has killed one herself.\n\"Umm...?\"\nHave I killed one?\nIt's a problem since my past memories are all jumbled up.\nI feel like I might have, though.\nThe only memories I can clearly recall overlap with Yu Seo-ah's memories and the novels I’ve read.\nNo, there must be more.\nThere has to be something else.\n\"Um, um?\"\n\"Right, you can learn from now on. Monsters, by their nature...\"\nFundamentally, they are ferocious and aggressive.\nFundamentally, they despise humans.\nFundamentally, they are hostile creatures.\nFundamentally, it’s best to avoid them.\n\"...but that one seems tame.\"\nWhat does that mean?\nLee Yu-ram is taken aback by a sight he’s never seen before.\nIt’s a wolf beast about the size of a large dog.\nThough it’s small, it’s so aggressively mad that it shouldn’t be safe to approach.\n\"Wow.\"\nHe’s petting it like a pet.\nIt’s lying on his lap.\nThe beast looks satisfied as well.\nIs it possible for a monster to feel something other than rage?\nAs Lee Yu-ram approaches, wondering if it’s not a monster, it growls and shows its teeth.\nEven then, the aggression is remarkably restrained.\nIf it were a typical scenario, it would have already lunged and bitten.\n‘Monster affinity? There’s no way it could behave like this just because of some drugs.’\nThe original plan was to record the process of Yu Seo-ah killing monsters.\nNow it looks like I’ll be documenting the process of them becoming friends.\nIt strangely fits together.\nPerhaps it’s because they both have black magical powers.\n“The fur is coarse.”\nEven when Yu Seo-ah pets the monster's head, it behaves as if it were just an ordinary dog.\nI’m curious how far this connection goes.\nWhat if it’s not this low-grade monster?\nI wonder how large of a beast its affinity extends to.\nI should suggest changing the direction of the experiment.\nMonster affinity might be the best trait for dealing with monsters, in a sense.\nThey seem to get along well.\nYu Seo-ah, who usually avoids people, is acting this way.\nKids typically like animals.\n“How cute.”\nEven if it's a compliment, it’s not actually cute.\nAfter all, a monster is still a monster; if let loose, it could kill dozens of people.\nIt cannot be raised like a pet.\nIf one wants a pet, they should raise a real animal.\nYu Seo-ah should know this well.\nThe reason she has no parents is likely because of a monster’s attack.\nLee Yu-ram also has memories of losing close people to monsters.\n“That’s enough. Take care of it.”\nThud.\nThe black blade pierces the wolf.\n“Eh.”\nYu Seo-ah looks down at her hand in shock.\nA blade has emerged from the hand that was petting it.\nThe blood is the same shade of red.\nAs if it’s unintentional, she examines the wolf, but it’s already dead.\nShe gazes blankly at the wolf's corpse.\nSince it’s a monster, it vanishes quickly.\nLeaving behind a few processable items.\n“Yeah, that's a really good ability. It’ll be very useful for dealing with monsters.”\nI approach, pretending to be friendly, and stab it.\nIt’s efficient.\n“It seems to have worked because it's a beast-type monster, but should I bring something like a golem next? There should be some recently captured specimens.”\nYu Seo-ah is still staring blankly at her hand.\n“Seoa?”",

      "content": "The puppy was cute. It felt like we could be friends.\nWell, I did kill it with my own hands, though.\nWhat am I even saying?\nWhy would I kill a puppy?\nIt was a bit big to be called a puppy, but still, it trusted me and followed me around.\nThere’s blood splattered on my hands.\nThe corpse is disappearing, evaporating into thin air.\nDid I kill it?\nWhy would I do that?\nEven though it was a monster, it didn’t attack. It was gentle.\nWhat if it hadn’t been a monster but a person, leaning on my lap?\nWould I have stabbed and killed them the same way?\nAm I supposed to kill anyone just because I’m told to?\nI didn’t want to kill it.\nSo, if anything or anyone stands in front of me, it’s going to be a problem.\nThis isn’t good.\n\"...Ugh...\"\nOn top of that, I keep remembering when I got stabbed.\nStill, it’s bearable.\nI felt a sudden rush of emotions, but I managed to hold it back.\nI’m fine with this much,\n\"Ugh.\"\nThis much is no problem at all.\nWhat, did you think I couldn’t handle something like this?\nKilling an animal is nothing.\n[13 hours 45 minutes]\nThere’s still plenty of the drug's effect left.\nIt’s not particularly unpleasant.\nThough, in a way, that’s also a problem.\n\"You just killed a monster, that’s all. You did well,\" Yuram said.\nIt seems like the puppy looked a bit too ferocious to her eyes.\n\"Do you see anything?\"\n\"See what?\"\n\"Like a level-up or something. When you kill monsters, you often get stronger. Though some require specific conditions to grow stronger.\"\nLevel-up.\nIs that how it works? Kill enough of them, and you get stronger?\nI’m not sure if Hansihu killed that many monsters.\nThe protagonist was strong even before he entered the academy.\nThat’s why he’s the protagonist, I guess.\nI think he leveled up at some point, too.\nHow did that work again?\n\"Well, I’ve been teaching for a long time, so I have a rough idea. I can tell what helps someone grow.\"\n\"Is that so.\"\nGrowth.\nIt’s a nice word.\n\"You probably have something too. Even if it's a drug-enhanced ability.\"\nThen I’ll just use more drugs.\nAs Yuram herself mentioned before.\nThat’s how it is.\n\"Next, three of them.\"\n\"Three?\"\n\"Yeah. The first real combat trial at the academy usually goes like this. After you take down ten wolves, depending on your ability, the next ones are like bear-shaped monsters or… Anyway, let’s start.\"\nWith a snap of her fingers, three wolves were summoned.\nThey were bigger than the one I killed earlier.\nI’d better deal with them properly.\nYeah, properly.\nI should try fighting well.Isn’t that how the protagonist would do it?\nBut I can’t do it.\nThey aren’t even barking, just standing there like tame dogs.\nThey don’t approach me either.\nNo matter how messed up someone is, they wouldn’t attack creatures like these.\nBut since I’m ordered to do it, I guess I have to.\nIt hurts, but I can’t help it.\nStill, maybe I should resist once.\nI want to see if I can disobey a command and hold out.\n\"Alright, go ahead and attack the three over there.\"\nThere’s no need to attack immediately.\nShe didn’t say when to attack.\nStab.\nCrack.\nAbout three seconds later.\nI slaughtered them brutally.\nThis is a power that’s beyond control.\nThinking back, there’s nothing in life I’ve been able to control.\nIf I wanted control, I shouldn’t have taken the drugs.\n[9 hours 58 minutes]\nIt’s not like taking the drugs was really my choice.\nWhen you're in pain, taking medicine is the right thing to do, isn’t it?\n\"Five this time.\"\nThis time, I’m going to try to stop.\nYuram doesn’t care much about what I do.\nShe knows that I’ll attack eventually.\nThe wolves still don’t try to attack me.\n\"Isn’t this enough? Five should be fine, right?\"\n\"Sorry, but I need to submit accurate data. Attack.\"\nStab, stab.\nCrunch.\nThe long blade pierced through the wolves.\nI’m definitely stronger now.\nStronger than when I fought Hansihu.\n\"Next, ten of them.\"\nThis isn’t good.\nI feel bad.\n[5 hours 56 minutes]\n\"Wait, stop.\"\nIt’s not about feeling sorry for the wolves.\nFighting like this is too inefficient.\nGenerating and extending the weapon is consuming the drug’s effects at an alarming rate.\n\"They’re just monsters. If you really want to become an academy student, you should endure.\"\nEndure?\nEndure what?\nThe time slipping away?\n\"No, I mean, the drugs—\"\n\"Come on, attack.\"\n\"I’m saying—\"\nCrack.\nThe giant sword pierced through ten wolves.\nWell, seven, to be exact.\nThe remaining ones didn’t die because the sword disappeared.\n[0]\n\"...It hurts.\"\nI couldn’t kill all ten wolves.\nHow is that possible? I crushed each one excessively.\nNo way I couldn’t kill all ten.Yuram finally looked at Yuseoa.\nDid she just say it hurts?\nYuseoa, who had stabbed herself without flinching, now says she’s in pain.\nSomething’s wrong.\nHer knees give out, and she collapses to the ground.\nShe needs the drug.\nThe wolves are rushing toward her.\n\"Damn it.\"\nWith the drug’s effect gone, her affinity with the wolves disappeared too.\nStill, these monsters are no match for Yuram alone.\nBesides, this is a training ground.\nWith a snap of her fingers, the monsters would return to where they came from.\n\"The drug's effect faded faster than I thought. You won’t be able to fight much longer like this.\"\nShe pulled out a syringe from her bag.\nNo need to remove the bandage.\nThe needle was designed to go straight through her thin clothes.\nStab.\nAfter a moment, Yuseoa regained her senses.\n\"Are you okay? Sorry, I should’ve given you the shot sooner.\"\nHer eyes were unfocused.\nShe was trembling.\n\"Doctor.\"\n\"Yuseoa?\"\nYuram was startled.\nIt seemed like she wasn’t in her right mind.\nShe was asking for a doctor, but didn’t seem to know Yuram was one.\n\"Insects instead of joints…\"\nShe appeared to be hallucinating.\nIt’s a temporary phenomenon.\nAll Yuram had to do was observe and stay calm.\nShe lifted Yuseoa and sat her on a chair.\n\"My muscles are melting.\"\nShe mumbled to herself.\nA sedative wouldn’t work in this state.\nShe needed another shot.\nShe wouldn’t live long anyway.\nPoor girl.\nShe really is a sick girl.\nThe guilt Yuram had been suppressing began to surface.\n\"I told you to run away, didn’t I?\"\nYuseoa didn’t seem to hear, lost in her hallucinations.\nStab.\nTwo shots of sedative.\nThis should calm her down.\nYuseoa’s body visibly relaxed, and her hallucinations seemed to fade away.\n\"...It hurts.\"\nShe looked like a child throwing a tantrum.\nTear streaks and drool stained her face.\nShe looked exhausted.\nIn fact, this state is closer to normal.\nBetter than smiling while under the drug’s influence.\n\"I… I don’t want to take the drugs anymore.\"\nBut there’s no way to stop.\nThe fact that she’s saying that just means the addiction is fading temporarily.\n\"It’s just temporary. Take a rest.\"\nHow many drugs had she taken just this morning?\nIn hindsight, it was way too much.\nHer outward appearance and her silly smiles.\nShe’d used far too many.\nNo, she had been holding on well enough.\nNot calculating the drug's duration was a mistake.\nIn the end, the answer is to use more drugs.\nIf you see her as a fighter and not a patient, that’s the only conclusion.\n\"Combat is on hold. There are too many issues.\"\nIt’s enough that we confirmed the existence of the affinity.\nCombat is a secondary matter.\n\"I want to go home.\"\nYuseoa looked down at the floor.\nShe wanted to go back.\nBack to the past.\n\"I’m sorry.\"\nIn the end, Yuram blurted out an apology.\n\"But… I have my reasons too. It’s not like I’m doing this because I enjoy it.\"\nShe tried to console herself with pathetic excuses.\nIt’s Yuseoa’s choice, after all, she thought. It’s for the best—for both of them and Hansihu.\nJust an excuse.\nBut she had a reason.\nShe needed to do this.\nTo fulfill her role as an academy instructor.\nBut why did she have to do it?\n\"I lost my family to monsters too... Being a doctor and an awakened healer didn't matter. I couldn't save my family.\"\nThat’s where her hatred for monsters came from.\nRevenge.\nShe thought Yuseoa might understand.\nShe wanted to believe that Yuseoa would sympathize.\nBut forcing Yuseoa to attack, thinking she'd develop some sort of affinity for the monsters, was definitely a mistake.\n\"I still have one family member left, though.\"\nShe had a younger sister.\nA sister who was still alive.\nWithout the academy’s support, there was no way to save her.\nShe was trapped at the academy, but it didn’t matter.\nAs long as she could save her sister.\n\"Yeah. I’ve got a little sister. My only remaining family.\"\nSomehow, she saw a bit of herself in Yuseoa.\nBut if she had to choose between the two, she would, without hesitation, choose her sister over Yuseoa.\n\"That's… fortunate.\"\nYuseoa responded with a bright smile.\nThat wasn’t the reaction Yuram had expected.\nShe wasn’t trying to say something comforting.\nShe just wanted to vent the things that had been weighing on her while Yuseoa was under the drug’s influence.\nBut when Yuseoa smiled like that, what was she supposed to feel?\nYuram stared blankly at her.\n\"It’s good to have family.\"\nThat’s true.\nHaving someone to rely on gives you peace of mind.\nEven if it's not reliance, even if they’re just someone you want to protect.\nHaving family brings a sense of security.\nWho is Yuseoa’s family?\nIt must be Hansihu.\nAnd for Hansihu, Yuseoa is probably the family he wants to protect.\nYuram didn’t want to ruin someone else’s family.\nThat’s why she gave Yuseoa the chance.\nShe told her to run.\nShe would help her as much as she could.\n\"I don’t have family, but… I have friends. I’m always the one receiving, though…\"\nYuseoa continued, her voice trailing off.\n\"Someday, I’ll be able to help them...\"\nShe seemed to believe that someday, she’d be able to return the favor.\nIf she became strong enough.\nFamily is precious to everyone.",

      "content": "\"Hello again. Nice to see you.\"\n\"I'm Chun Yuseong, who just entered the academy.\"\nWhy is the person who said we wouldn’t meet again standing here?\nYuseoa was staring at the academy’s ranking board.\nThe test results had been announced.\nSince they were posted online, there was no need to look at the board hanging in the hallway, but here she was.\n\"Hmm, you’re 28th.\"\nChun Yuseong spoke, glancing at her.\nYuseoa had hoped he wouldn’t notice her, but since he did, she might as well talk to him.\n\"Yes. And you?\"\n\"That’s classified.\"\nHe said that, but if she searched for his name, it would come up easily.\nShe scanned the board, but the name 'Yuseoa' wasn’t among the top 100.\nNo, it wasn’t there.\nOutside the top 100.\nAnything below the top 100 wasn’t publicly shown; only the academy and the individual would know their score.\n\"Well, good luck.\"\n\"I’m fine.\"\nHe said that, but his face looked like he’d been crying.\nUnlike before, he wasn’t wearing his usual eyepatch.\n\"What about your eyepatch? Didn’t you say it was sealing something?\"\nHis eye color wasn’t different or anything special.\n\"Oh, uh...\"\nHe touched his face, looking flustered.\nHe seemed to have just realized that he wasn’t wearing the eyepatch.\n\"...Well, sometimes that happens.\"\nSo what if the score wasn’t great?\nIt’s normal to be disappointed if you didn’t do as well as expected.\nHe was probably so shocked that he forgot to wear his eyepatch.\n\"...\"\nWith a bitter expression, he touched the area around his eyes.\nWas he thinking of an excuse?\n\"Well, it’s just for decoration. I don’t really need it.\"\nHe admitted that the eyepatch was just an accessory.\nHe seemed a lot less confident than when she first met him.\n\"Isn’t your bandage just for show too?\"\nYuseoa decided to ask outright.\nIt might be rude, but she was curious about how he would respond.\n\"...Heh.\"\nHe laughed.\nIt felt like she touched a sensitive subject.\nMaybe it was a mistake.\nTouching on something personal was certainly rude.\n\"I wish it were.\"\nHe muttered softly to himself.\nWas the bandage actually useful for something?\n\"Anyway, don’t worry too much. You can do better next time.\"\n\"...No, it’s too late. It can’t be.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"I’m not number one.\"\nNot only was she not number one, Yuseoa’s name wasn’t in second place either.\nFirst place was Chun Yuhwa, my younger sister, and second was Hansihu.\nI heard the ranking difference was just a close margin.\n\"I was always number one. In everything.\"\nYuseoa must have been used to being first her entire life.\nSeeing the rankings at the academy must have been a shock for her.\nIt’s unfortunate, but there’s nothing she could do.\n\"With more training, I’m sure you’ll improve.\"\nEffort usually brings results.\nAt least, that’s what I believe.\n\"It must be a lack of training time.\"\n\"That’s likely.\"\n\"...Is that so.\"\nShe seemed to accept it.\nIt looked like she was planning to increase her training time.\n\"Training time, huh...\"\nI was curious about what kind of training she did.\nI also wondered what abilities she had.I was about to ask, but she seemed ready to leave.\n\"Well, you’re lucky to have had another conversation with me. We probably won’t see each other much from now on. Goodbye.\"\nShe said something similar last time.\nWhy do I feel like we’ll meet again?\nThere are a lot of strange people at this academy.\nI checked the ranking board.\nI wasn’t number one.\nWhy?\nNumber one should be set in stone.\nHow is Hansihu not in first place?\nThe protagonist is always number one.\nNo matter what he does, Hansihu is always the best.\nThe top of the top.\nHe should have been the best.\n\"Not enough training time.\"\nChun Yuseong was right.\nTraining and real combat are necessary to grow stronger.\nBut lately, Hansihu has wasted too much time because of me.\nTime that’s been thrown away.\nIn the end, Yuseoa is the problem.\nIf things continue like this, the story’s progression will be completely derailed.\nIf even the protagonist falls apart, the world is doomed.\nBut it’s still just the beginning of the academy.\nThe protagonist is still strong.\nThere must be a way.\n[17 hours 4 minutes]\n\"...What should I do now?\"\nIt was the afternoon, and all the classes had finished.\nStudents were wandering around the streets.\nMost of them were moving in groups.\nWhen people think of school life, that’s probably the image they imagine.\nThough there are more unusual things here than in a normal school.\nBut what about me?\nAm I even a student?\nI’m the only one in my class—it’s not like this is some small rural school.\nEven in rural areas, having just one student would be extremely rare.\nAnd the other classes are full of students.\nI walked toward the dormitory.\nI guess I’m a student since I’m assigned a dorm room.\nThat means I’m a student, right?\nStill, I feel out of place as a student.\nI’m a student at the academy, yet I haven’t made any friends.\nAnd I don’t like having to kill a puppy just because I’m forced to.\nI hate that the drug’s effects are being wasted too.\nClick.\nThe door opened.\nWhen I entered my dorm room, I saw ropes and knives lying around.\nThe bloodstains were only half-cleaned.\nIs this really a student’s dormitory?\n\"A student...\"\nEver since I came to the academy, I haven’t felt comfortable.\nThere are too many strange people.\n\"Me?\"\nThis is so different from what I expected.\nJust getting into the academy was a miracle, but I’m only here because of Hansihu.\nI know that.\nI don’t deserve to enjoy a normal school life.\n\"If only I hadn’t awakened...\"\nIt would’ve been better if Hansihu and Yuseoa were normal.\nThey could have attended a regular school and lived peaceful lives.\nThe academy, sending kids to battlefields, is far from an ideal educational institution.\nIt would have been better if monsters and awakened powers didn’t exist at all.\nThings would have been more peaceful.\nYuseoa wouldn’t have messed up her medication either.\n-Stab.\n\"...Heh.\"\nI can’t help but laugh.\nIt’s because the drug feels good, of course.\n[21 hours 5 minutes]\nThe drug?\nThe time has increased.\nWhy did I use it?\nI feel happy.\nMaybe because I used it in a calm state.\n\"Hah.\"\nI still had plenty of time left.\nWhy did I use more?\nI could’ve just tolerated feeling a little down.\nThere was no need to use the drug.\nI have eight 4-hour doses left at home.\nThat’s an amount that’s hard to save up with normal self-control.\nBut I just used one.\nFor no reason other than feeling bad.\n\"...Heh.\"\nStab.\nI can’t stop.\nIt doesn’t matter.\nWith the time I’ve gained, there’s no point in saving it.\nThe tingling sensation feels good.\n\"Hah, hah.\"\nStab.\nThe third one.\nThe more I use, the better it feels.\nIt’s starting to feel like the old days.\nThat familiar rush.\n[26 hours 55 minutes]\nThe amount of time I gained decreased.\nThat’s what happens when you use them in quick succession.\nIt’s inefficient.\nBut that doesn’t matter.\nClatter.\nI hear the sound of a syringe hitting the ground.\nNow I only have one left.\nWhen did I use them all?\n[33 hours 1 minute]\nIs there no more?\nFor now, I’m fine.\nI feel happy.\nIt’s a happiness that I like.\nI don’t think about anything.\nSomeone else will handle whatever comes next.\nNot me, though.\nRight now, I just want to stay safely in this feeling of bliss.\nThe future me?\nWho cares?\nThe present, right now, is what’s most important.\nThere’s nothing to be gained by putting things off.\nNo.\nI had a plan, didn’t I?\nI was trying to do something.\n\"...Huh?\"\nThe door’s open.\nThis feels familiar.\nI’m sure it was closed, but now it’s open.\nIs it the doctor?\nThe only person who would walk in like this is the doctor.\n\"Doctor?\"\n\"...Ah.\"\nA voice filled with confusion.\n\"Who?\"\nIt’s hard to see because of the backlight.\nIt doesn’t matter.\nThis might just be a dream.\n\"What are you doing?\"\nIt’s a familiar voice.\nHansihu?\n\"Heh...\"\nI’ve been caught.\nBut it doesn’t matter.\nI feel good for the first time in a while.\nNow I understand why I keep dragging myself through life.\nIt’s for moments like this.\nThat one moment when the feeling pierces the sky.\nThat moment when I don’t want to fall, even though I can’t move my body.\n\"Don’t come any closer.\"\nI know what you can do, Hansihu.\nYou’re good at nullifying the drug’s effects.\nBut not right now.\nLet’s meet later.\n\"Get out.\"\nI said it with a smile.\nThis is my room.\nI held the last syringe behind my back.\nI had been wondering when to use it.\nI planned to use it when the high faded.\nIt seems like now is the time.\nHansihu looks like he might take it away, so I keep it hidden behind me.\nGet out.\nJust disappear.\n\"Okay, let’s go out.\"\nTogether?\nWhat is he talking about?\nI said to go alone.\n\"Let’s leave the academy and go home. We’ll go back home.\"\nI didn’t expect to hear that from Hansihu.\nNot Yuseoa, but Hansihu, talking about leaving the academy?\nMaybe he’s lost his mind because of the drugs.\nIt must be some kind of hallucination or delusion.\n\"Home?\"\n\"If we leave on our own, we might get wanted notices, but if we go to a faraway city, we’ll be fine.\"\n\"Uh, what?\"\nHe’s talking about running away.\nCan the protagonist even do that?\nThere’s still so much left to do.\nThe key characters haven’t even played their parts yet.\nSome important characters have barely been introduced.\nThe story has just started. Can he really leave?\n\"So let’s go together.\"\nHansihu looked pained, like he was desperate.\nNo matter how strong the protagonist is, when things get this bad, their mental state will wear down.\nI feel sorry for him.\n\"What about the drugs?\"\nThe only reason I’m still here is because of the drugs.\nI didn’t want to be stuck at the academy either.\n\"I found a supply route.\"\nHansihu held up some of the drugs from the academy.\nBut the academy shouldn’t be giving him drugs anymore.\n\"I can get the drugs even without the academy. So let’s go.\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nHansihu is amazing, as expected.\nAs the protagonist, he can do impossible things.\nCompared to someone like me, he’s on a whole different level.\nHe can even get the drugs without Yuram’s help.\n\"We’re going home?\"\n\"It’ll be hard to go back to the original house, but we can find a new one. There’s no reason to stay at the academy. It’s too dangerous here.\"\nI agree with that.\nThere are way too many strange people here.\nThis isn’t the school life I was hoping for.\nIt’s time to escape.\nIt feels like I can see the light.\nIt feels like the wind is blowing.\nI feel refreshed.\nIs it because of the drugs?\nI still haven’t used the one I’m holding.\n\"So let’s go.\"\n\"When?\"\n\"...Now.\"\nHansihu is serious.\nThis is real hope.\nThe first real hope I’ve seen in a long time.",

Right now?\"\nIt was a hopeful prospect, but an unexpected development.\nLuckily, there wasn’t much to pack.\nSo we’re leaving immediately?\nHow?\n\"We can get five hours out as a temporary leave.

Hansihu.\"\nIt was Hansihu who opened the door.\nHe was breathing heavily, like he’d run from far away.\nHis confused expression was just like earlier.\nSo it must be another hallucination.\nI couldn’t even hear what Hansihu was saying.\n\"Heh.\"\nThe problem is, I’ve taken too many drugs.\nThe only solution now is to take even more.\n\"Hey, heh, did you bring any drugs with you?\"\nPlease, just give me something.\nYou’re here to help, right?\nI remember now.\nAround the time I used the fourth syringe, I pressed the emergency button on the device.\nI must’ve done it thinking Hansihu would come and bring me more drugs.\n\"Don’t you have any?\"\nI see.\nBut the doctor promised to give me unlimited drugs.\nAll I had to do was kill you.\nBut I’ve held on this long.\nI’ve done well not to take too many drugs, and I haven’t even killed anyone.\nWell, I did, but that was a monster, not a person.\nIt wasn’t my choice.\nI could kill, but I haven’t, because I don’t want to.\n[34 hours 5 minutes]\nDamn it.\nMy mouth is moving on its own, saying things I don’t want to say.\nHansihu?\nWould it be okay if I killed you just once?\nYou want to help me too, right?\nThe doctor said I’d get more drugs if I did.\nThat’s a good thing, right?\nI’m only staying at the academy because of the drugs.\nIf I do this, I’ll be able to leave.\nWe’re friends, right?\nYou’re the protagonist, so even if you die, you’ll find a way back, won’t you?\nPlease, just this once, let me kill you.\nJust this once.\nI’m sorry.",

      "content": "\"Just once, please die for me.\"\nShe speaks while holding a kitchen knife. Inside the dark house, the sound of leaking water echoes.\n\"What are you talking about?\"\nHan Si-Hoo glances at Yoo Seo-Ah.\n\"They said they'd give me the drugs. The doctor. For life.\"\nIn the end, it’s because of the doctor again. Just being at the academy couldn't erase the remnants of the doctor.\n\"...I see.\"\nThe disarray in the dormitory becomes clear. The reason she wasn't answering her phone is now obvious. The broken device, the pieces of rope lying around for some reason, multiple empty syringes, and bottles that once held pills rolling on the floor.\nFrom the direction of the bathroom, the sound of overflowing water continues. It makes one wonder what she was doing.\n\"So, just help me out once.\"\nIt's impossible to refuse when asked for help.\n\"Can't you just die for me, just once?\"\nJust once. Yoo Seo-Ah pleads with a kitchen knife in her hand. It’s not something anyone should ever ask of someone else.\nHan Si-Hoo doesn’t know what happened to Yoo Seo-Ah today. He doesn’t know how much of the drugs she used. He had rushed back from fighting in the city center.\nHe had saved many lives. He rescued children who were being attacked by monsters. It was during that time that the emergency call came through.\nMany unknown civilians, and one friend. Who should he prioritize?\nThe chronic manpower shortage is a problem. There are too few people actively working as Awakened. Even the number of people assembled at the academy is insufficient. If Han Si-Hoo leaves, who knows how many more people might suffer?\nHe tries calling, but there is no answer. Should he retreat to the academy from here? At some point, the number of people Han Si-Hoo had to protect increased. From just Yoo Seo-Ah to all innocent citizens.\n\"You're the protagonist, so you can handle it, right?\"\nYou can save everyone. Yoo Seo-Ah believes that Han Si-Hoo can do anything.\n\"Protagonist?\"\n\"Right? You want me to get better too, don’t you? You want me to be okay and happy, right?\"\nOf course, he does. He desperately wants Yoo Seo-Ah to recover.\n\"Get a hold of yourself...\"\nIn the end, Han Si-Hoo couldn’t fully guarantee the safety of the citizens. He knew there was no one else to help Yoo Seo-Ah. The battle was almost over, so leaving wouldn’t have caused a major problem.\n\"Get a hold of myself? I’m feeling really good right now. I’m happy.\"\nThe sound of water pouring out from the bathroom doesn’t stop. Water droplets continue to drip from Yoo Seo-Ah's hair and clothes.\n\"That's not...\"\nThat’s not real happiness. He’s certain of that much. So, what is true happiness?\nLiving for others. That’s how Han Si-Hoo had lived. Someone once said that’s the fate of a hero. They said to repay the strength you have. They said to take responsibility for saving people.\nHe feels guilty enough to want to die. It’s his fault that Yoo Seo-Ah, who always depended on him, ended up like this. If dying could solve everything, that would be nice. But that would just be irresponsible escapism.\n\"Can't you just die for me?\"\nShe smiles as she says it. Han Si-Hoo follows suit with a light smile.\n\"...[Augment].\"\nIt’s a new skill he gained. Thanks to defeating the boss monster in the recent city battle. Han Si-Hoo had always thought this world was like a game. A game with incredibly high freedom.\nIf he attacks in an augmented state, his power will increase. The same goes for using other skills. It’s a reinforcement skill.\nYou defeat monsters. Your level goes up. You allocate stat points. You get stronger. You defeat even stronger monsters.\nIt’s a loop. Eventually, you defeat boss monsters, complete quests, and progress. It’s no different from a game.\n\"Ugh...?\"\nYoo Seo-Ah backs away from the approaching Han Si-Hoo. It doesn’t look like he’s going to simply die for her. That leaves only one option—fight. But she’s scared.\nCrash.\nYoo Seo-Ah slips on the water spilled across the floor. She falls back clumsily, trying to avoid Han Si-Hoo.\n\"When a skill reaches level 5, it gets a special effect, and once it surpasses level 10, its performance becomes overwhelmingly better.\"\n[Purification] was still at level 1. The strong penalty from the purification was due to that. That’s also why it could only strip away the effects of her drugs, nothing more.\n\"Ugh.\"\nHan Si-Hoo is now standing right beside the fallen Yoo Seo-Ah. So close that their breath mixes. This is the perfect chance, isn’t it?\nStab.\nHis arm gets stabbed—not by a syringe, but by the kitchen knife. He doesn’t bother to block it. As long as Yoo Seo-Ah returns to normal, nothing else matters.\nThrust.\nThe blade pierces his abdomen. So this is the kind of pain it brings. He endures it, thinking it’s the same pain Yoo Seo-Ah must have felt.\n\"[Purification].\"\nHe had already poured all of his remaining skill points into Purification. This was why Han Si-Hoo couldn’t place first in the academy test. He had invested heavily in an unusual skill. But here, he found hope. He believed he could save Yoo Seo-Ah somehow. With the addition of the newly acquired Augment skill, it seemed possible.\nLight floods in.\nLight.\n[Paused.]\nWith a clarity he had never experienced, he assessed the situation. The trashed house. The syringes. He didn’t care about the scars on his body.\nIt was a sensation he hadn’t felt in a long time. Everything was vividly clear. The chaotic mess in the house stood out sharply.\nThe smell of tap water. He could feel the water dripping from his head. The taste of iron lingered in his mouth.\n\"Ah...?\"\nHan Si-Hoo is lying on the floor. Blood is flowing from his abdomen. The kitchen knife, stained with blood, is in her hand.\nHer trembling hands. She can’t remember what she just did. What class was today? Why is Han Si-Hoo lying here?\nMove. Do something. Report it. Someone’s hurt.\n\"Can't you just die for me, just once?\"\nShe remembers. It’s a line she can’t believe she said. What on earth had she been saying?\n[Paused.]\n\"Ah, ah?\"\nShe had believed the protagonist wouldn’t die.\n\"Y-you’re... okay...\"\nHe’s still breathing. He’s not dead yet.\nGet a hold of yourself.\nHan Si-Hoo’s words echo in her ears. Now that she has finally come to her senses, she can’t think of what to do. Seeing the protagonist collapsed like this wasn’t part of the plan.\nHow did it come to this? How did things fall so far? No matter how much she needed the drugs, she shouldn’t have let herself spiral down this path.\n[Paused.]\n\"Si-Hoo?\"\nA voice from another person reaches her ears. Looking toward the torn-down door, she sees a girl standing there, holding a sword in each hand. Her long, braided black hair. It’s Yeon-Hwa. She’s the one who had tried to give Han Si-Hoo a gift last time, which Yoo Seo-Ah had accepted on his behalf.\n\"You are?\"\nNow she understands what it means for someone’s aura to radiate killing intent. Her body tingles from the sensation.\n\"What have you done?\"\nShe doesn’t know.\n\"Si-Hoo said you were his friend. Did you attack him?\"\nAttack? Why would she attack him? But she did attack him. Though it wasn’t intentional.\nNo, it was intentional. The kitchen knife is still in her hand.\n\"...Syringes?\"\nYeon-Hwa looks confused. Several empty syringes roll across the floor. How much had she used? She can’t believe that was all her doing.\n\"Si-Hoo, the blood, it’s because of me.\"\nThere’s no time for this. She has to save Han Si-Hoo first.\n\"Sigh.\"\nYeon-Hwa seems to have realized what needs to be prioritized. She pulls Han Si-Hoo away from Yoo Seo-Ah and checks his wound. While assessing Han Si-Hoo’s condition, she points her sword at Yoo Seo-Ah.\nShe’s on guard. To Yeon-Hwa, Yoo Seo-Ah is clearly an enemy. There’s no way to explain herself after stabbing Han Si-Hoo.\nYoo Seo-Ah doesn’t dislike Si-Hoo. On the contrary, she likes him. He’s her friend. So why did she stab him?\n[Paused.]\nIt’s because of time. She has no idea how time has stopped. It’s thanks to Han Si-Hoo’s purification. Will everything go back to normal once Han Si-Hoo recovers?\n\"Are you okay, Si-Hoo?\"\nYeon-Hwa checks on Han Si-Hoo’s condition. Yoo Seo-Ah wants to ask the same question. But it feels strange to ask if someone is okay when you’re the one who stabbed them. She never really meant to stab him. But saying that would sound like a flimsy excuse. It’s her fault.\n\"Help is on the way. Just hang in there a bit longer.\"\nYeon-Hwa is clearly suspicious of her. She checks whether the unconscious Han Si-Hoo is still breathing, then looks back at Yoo Seo-Ah.\n\"Because of you.\"\nThere’s a clear sense of anger. A killing intent as if she could kill Yoo Seo-Ah right now.\n\"I’ve heard you’re from the slums, but I never imagined things would come to this.\"\nShe also seems to know something about Yoo Seo-Ah. Did Si-Hoo tell her?\n\"You’re a drug addict, aren’t you? I’ve seen people like you before. Disgusting.\"\nYoo Seo-Ah can’t argue with her.\n\"Why did you come here? Did you think being an old friend excused this kind of behavior?\"\nNo. She still has a conscience. She has morals. But without the drugs, the pain was unbearable.\nEven now, her arm aches. Her hands are sore, possibly bruised. Her whole body feels creaky and stiff. When the drugs kick in, all of that goes away.\nShe didn’t do all this just for a bit of pain relief. She just had no other choice.\n\"It seems like you're out of your mind. Get some proper treatment. And pay for your crimes.\"\nTreatment. Yoo Seo-Ah had thought the same thing. She’s half-soaked, still holding the knife. She had thought the drugs were treatment, and this is what it led to.\n\"Do you have some kind of grudge against him?\"\nYeon-Hwa wraps Si-Hoo’s wound with her clothes to stop the bleeding. Even while doing that, she doesn’t drop her guard against Yoo Seo-Ah.\n[Paused.]\nHow long has it been since the drugs stopped controlling her? Thanks to Han Si-Hoo. She doesn’t hold any grudge. He’s her friend.\nThings could have gone back to how they were. If only she hadn’t stabbed him, this wouldn’t have happened. Everything would have been fine. Maybe they could’ve gone back to when Yoo Seo-Ah and Si-Hoo were just friends.\nBut because of what she did. She did stab him. But it’s strange that just being stabbed made Han Si-Hoo collapse like that. There must be something more.\nHe had looked exhausted even when he arrived at the dorm. He probably came here after fighting somewhere, and it was because of her. Given the situation, that seems likely. So was that why he collapsed from her attack?\n\"...I hear footsteps. It seems the medical team has arrived, so I’ll have them take you as well.\"\nShe had done something inhuman. She had held Han Si-Hoo back for a long time. And in the end, she couldn’t help him at all.\nDamn it. She really didn’t want to attack Han Si-Hoo. Do people resort to anything when they’re backed into a corner?\n[Paused.]\nDid I really try to kill Han Si-Hoo? Even if you hate someone, you don’t really try to kill them. There’s no way I did that.\nEven if you ask what I did, I didn’t do it. Well, I did. But I didn’t.\nYou tried to kill him. Now, it’s impossible to hide behind the effects of the drugs. She can’t even tell if her body is soaked with water or blood.\n\"It’s going to hurt.\"\nBang.\nWith that, her consciousness fades out.",

      "content": "Ah. It came back to me. I regained consciousness.\nI’m in that state where I’ve just woken up, still drowsy, but I remember now. I remember the day I opened my eyes in this world.\nBack then, I had a clear goal. Though I didn’t get very far with it.\nI did have a goal. I really did. Looking back, I realize I wasn’t holding on—I had already crumbled a long time ago. I was just stuck in that state, unable to move forward.\nThere was a clear goal: somehow, make Han Si-Hoo reconcile with Yoo Seo-Ah. Get them close again. Make it so there was no unfortunate past. Prevent any tragic events from happening. Why would the author kill off the childhood friend so early on?\nIf I had been the protagonist. If I had been the protagonist, none of this would have happened. Being a protagonist and being this incompetent? If it were me, I could have protected everything. A baseless belief that I could have done it all.\nBut what I see before me is a tangled mess of a story. I can’t even remember what the original plot was anymore. It’s still early in the novel, and yet everything has already gone wrong.\nStill, I did something right. The fact that Yoo Seo-Ah is still alive—that’s something, right?\n[Paused]\nOr is it really something to be proud of? Is being alive alone enough to call it an accomplishment? It feels like Han Si-Hoo deserves most of the credit. But Han Si-Hoo must have paid some price. I need to apologize to him.\nThe fact that I don’t need to use the drugs anymore is a relief. Maybe now, I can truly heal Yoo Seo-Ah.\n\"It’s been a while.\"\nSomeone is sitting next to the bed. The voice is familiar. It’s similar to the one I used to hear back at home.\nThe doctor.\n\"Ah...?\"\nWhere am I, that the doctor is here?\n\"I heard you tried to kill Han Si-Hoo. Unfortunately, you failed.\"\n\"What? I—what?\"\nHow does he know that? More importantly, where am I? Where am I?\n\"Calm down. You’re in the academy’s medical facility.\"\n\"......\"\nThen why is the doctor here? It’s hard to understand. Is this all a dream?\n\"That promise. You remember it, right? The one where you’d receive drugs if you killed Han Si-Hoo? Of course, I assumed you would remember.\"\nEven though I used a lot of drugs, I wouldn’t have attacked Han Si-Hoo if it weren’t for the doctor’s promise. Back then, it felt like my brain had been cut off, and all I could think about was malice. Kill Han Si-Hoo. I kept asking myself what the doctor had said. And what did he say? Kill Han Si-Hoo. Was that a suggestion, or an order?\n\"You tried your best.\"\nThe doctor pats my head. The touch is strangely comforting. For a moment, I feel my mind ease and my body relax.\nIt’s all the doctor’s fault for giving me the drugs. I should hate him. But I don’t feel any resistance or anger. I don’t see the doctor as an enemy. He just seems like a good person.\n\"You’ll do better next time. The drugs will continue to be provided for free.\"\n\"Drugs? For free?\"\n\"It’s under the guise of military supplies from the academy. But in the end, I’m the one prescribing them.\"\nI don’t understand. Why is he talking as if the drugs from the academy are his?\n\"But... they’re from the academy...\"\n\"That’s not entirely wrong.\"\nThe doctor speaks calmly, as if it’s no big deal.\n\"I’m on the academy’s board of directors. The supply of your drugs is handled through me.\"\n\"Board of directors?\"\nI think I remember Lee Yoo-Ram saying something about the drugs coming from the board. I didn’t expect the doctor to be involved.\n\"In any case, you’re free to use as much as you like.\"\nThe doctor opens a briefcase similar to the one Lee Yoo-Ram had carried. Inside are several syringes.\n\"Ah, I don’t need the drugs anymore.\"\nI would have been grateful before. But not now.\n\"I’m all healed now. I don’t need the drugs anymore.\"\n[Paused]\nTime freezes. There’s no need for them anymore. What is the doctor’s expression right now? I can’t quite see it. It’s strange—the room is brightly lit.\nThe doctor seems to study me for a moment.\n\"Is that so. I had a feeling you might say that. It seems Han Si-Hoo really did fix everything.\"\nYes, Han Si-Hoo solved it. How the doctor knows that, I don’t know.\n\"Yes.\"\nEven though I stabbed him with a knife. I still feel incredibly guilty. I never wanted to do that.\n\"Then you don’t intend to try to kill Han Si-Hoo again.\"\n\"Kill Si-Hoo? Why would I ever think of doing that?\"\nIt sounds absurd. Killing? I would never. No matter how much I hate or resent someone, it never leads to thoughts of murder.\n\"He’s my friend.\"\nEspecially because he’s my friend. Who in their right mind would kill a friend?\n\"Then it seems you’ll need to repay your debt to Han Si-Hoo.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nRepaying him is the right thing to do. At the very least, I need to thank him.\n\"What do you think is the best way? Helping Han Si-Hoo would be ideal, but what you can do is quite limited.\"\n\"Hmm...\"\n\"If you were still using the drugs, you could fight like an Awakened, but that’s no longer an option.\"\n\"Still...\"\nI was never an Awakened in the first place. It’s disappointing that I can’t fight, but there must be some other way to help.\n\"But since Han Si-Hoo seems to like you, it would be good for you to meet him. Talk things over.\"\n\"I’ll do that.\"\nThe doctor is always right. That’s a fact. Even without the drugs, I know that much.\nHe doesn’t try to force the drugs on me either. After all, they were prescribed because I was in pain. If I don’t need treatment anymore, there’s no reason to take them.\n\"Before that.\"\nThe doctor grabs my hand.\n\"Ouch.\"\nIt hurts. It hurts. He only touched me lightly, but it’s already this painful. Without the drugs, my whole body feels like it’s going to break apart. I’m just holding on.\nWhen I use the drugs, my mind goes hazy from the effect. Without them, my mind goes hazy from the pain. There’s no way out.\n\"Would you like to treat your wounds first?\"\nThe doctor lets go of my hand. It seems like he’s asking if I really don’t need the drugs anymore.\n[Paused]\nBut I won’t use them anymore. This is the opportunity Han Si-Hoo gave me. I can’t waste it.\nNo matter what, I won’t use the drugs again.\n\"I’m fine.\"\nI’m normal. Sure, my body aches and stings, but I don’t need the drugs.\n\"As you wish.\"\nIt seems the doctor has decided to respect my decision. If the patient doesn’t want treatment, there’s not much he can do.\n\"Han Si-Hoo is in the medical facility downstairs.\"\n\"Yes. I’ll go see him. Thank you.\"\nThe doctor really is kind. He even tells me exactly where to go.\nHan Si-Hoo opens his eyes.\n\"The medical facility?\"\nIt’s the academy’s medical ward. Where Lee Yoo-Ram is.\nThe wounds on his body have already healed. It feels strange. It’s been a long time since he’s been knocked out like this.\n[Status Window] Level: 31 HP: 1381, MP: 990... Skills: Swordsmanship X, Purification X, Magic VI...\nPurification has caught up to his swordsmanship level. He isn’t sure if it was the right choice to invest all his skill points into Purification. But he believes saving his friend was the right thing to do.\nStatus: Purification Penalty (1720 hours)\nLooking down, he sees an unexpected number.\n\"...1720 hours?\"\nA quick mental calculation tells him that’s around 70 days. The last penalty didn’t feel great, but this time the scale is entirely different. Still, he can endure it. It’s only about two months. He can manage that.\n\"Si-Hoo?\"\nThere’s someone there.\n\"You’re awake? Are you alright?\"\nYeon-Hwa steps through the curtain surrounding his bed. Han Si-Hoo feels something off and starts to recall his memory. The last person he saw before passing out was none other than Yoo Seo-Ah.\n\"Yeon-Hwa?\"\n\"I found you passed out. I’ve been waiting for you to wake up.\"\n\"What about Seo-Ah?\"\nThe important thing is what happened to Seo-Ah. Yeon-Hwa must have followed Han Si-Hoo after he disappeared during the battle.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"We were together at the end.\"\nHis last memory is still blurry. He shouldn’t have passed out at that moment, not just from being stabbed. It must have been the backlash from using his skills.\nIt seems the Purification penalty had amplified. Using it with his level 10 Augment skill must have made this Purification work perfectly.\n\"...That strange girl? Teacher Lee Yoo-Ram took her separately.\"\n\"I see.\"\nYeon-Hwa finally asks the question that’s been on her mind.\n\"But why was someone like her at the academy?\"\nThe last time she saw an unfamiliar girl emerge from Han Si-Hoo’s house, her brain had nearly frozen. But now, she understands. Han Si-Hoo had been dealing with something enormous. An old friend turned drug addict, and he was trying to take care of her—that’s the only conclusion she could draw.\nBut in the end, that friend stabbed him. Because she’s from the slums. It’s a filthy place. If a girl from a place like that did something awful, it wouldn’t be surprising.\nThough Han Si-Hoo had been connected to such a person, thankfully, it was now over. There was no way he would continue to protect a girl who not only lacked gratitude but even tried to kill him.\n\"It’s my fault.\"\nHan Si-Hoo answers. It was his fault that Yoo Seo-Ah ended up at the academy.\nHan Si-Hoo’s mistakes were his to fix. No one else could solve his problems for him. So he had found a way.\nHe poured all of his skill points into Purification. Now, all that remains is the 1700-hour penalty. The concern is that he still doesn’t know exactly what part of him is affected by the penalty.\nIt’s different from last time. He can no longer hear that voice. He doesn’t feel like his thoughts are being interrupted.\nIf Yoo Seo-Ah is alright, everything will be perfect. He needs to find out if the Purification worked properly.\nWill everything finally go back to how it was? At last? He doesn’t regret using his level-up points. He can always level up again, and there might be more situations where the Purification skill will be useful.\n\"Sorry you had to deal with all this, and thanks.\"\nYeon-Hwa blushes.\n\"I was just repaying my debt from last time. So don’t worry about it.\"\nShe had owed Han Si-Hoo for saving her before. Delivering a gift hadn’t felt like enough. Now, she felt more at ease.\nGood, this is good. Yeon-Hwa thought to herself. She was happy to feel closer to Han Si-Hoo.\n\"...Then I’ll go see Seo-Ah.\"\nHe rises from his bed.\n\"Huh?\"\nHan Si-Hoo has unfinished business.\n\"That’s dangerous.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"She’s the one who tried to kill you. I don’t see why you need to go.\"\n\"Ah, that. It should be fine now, probably.\"\nOn what grounds? She’s just a drug addict. Still, Yeon-Hwa remembered how pitiful Yoo Seo-Ah looked, trembling and gasping for breath at the end.\nSyringes, knives, hammers, ropes. Signs of drug use. Bandages. Even to Yeon-Hwa, who had only caught a glimpse, she looked pitiful. Though she was unconscious when Yeon-Hwa sent her off to the treatment facility.\n\"Seventeen hundred, huh.\"\nPurification Penalty (1720 hours)\n\"Huh? Numbers? What about them?\"\nYeon-Hwa asks, confused by the sudden mention of numbers.\n\"It’s dangerous.\"\nHan Si-Hoo holds his head. His thoughts are becoming contaminated.\n\"...Are you okay, Si-Hoo?\"\nSilence.\nYoo Seo-Ah is garbage. A hindrance. A fool. An obstacle to his growth.\nIf he meets her again, he might just strangle her right away.\nBut he won’t. Never. Just having these thoughts makes him feel disgusted.\nHe won’t kill her. Instead, let her suffer and pay for what she’s done.\nShut up.\nHan Si-Hoo crushes the rising malice within him. The penalty has started.\n\"No.\"\nHe’s not okay. But if Yoo Seo-Ah is truly better now, then it’s a success. If he sees her himself, who knows what he might do. So what should he do?\nHe needs someone reliable to check on her condition. Han Si-Hoo briefly thinks about the friends he’s made.\nThere’s no one closer to him than Yoo Seo-Ah. But there are a few people he trusts.\nJust as he’s debating who to send, someone opens the door to the medical room. A familiar silhouette staggers in.\nIt’s Yoo Seo-Ah. She smiles when she spots Han Si-Hoo.\n\"Si-Hoo.\"\nPurification Penalty (1719 hours)\nThe person most in need of Purification is standing right there.",

      "content": "-After the accident, the perpetrator said, \"I was too drunk to remember.\"\nIt was a news story I had seen before. Trash. How could being drunk be a reason for a lighter sentence? You should be responsible for your actions.\nIsn’t it the same with drugs? But I didn’t take the drugs of my own free will. I might have injected every syringe I had, but in this clear state of mind, I would never have done such a thing.\nI know that much. Yes, that must be it.\n\"Yeon-Hwa, could you step aside for a moment? Just for a bit.\"\nHan Si-Hoo gives me a strange look. That girl is still keeping her guard up against me.\n\"You said it was dangerous? Something about 'seventeen hundred' or whatever. Are you sure you're okay?\"\nDangerous? What is she talking about?\n\"I’m fine.\"\n\"...Be careful.\"\nYeon-Hwa says that and then leaves the room. What should I be careful of? Now it’s just Si-Hoo and me. The atmosphere feels strange. Anyway, I need to say what I came to say.\n\"Uh, Si-Hoo. Thank you. I think I don’t need the drugs anymore. I’m all better.\"\n[Paused]\nAm I really better? “Paused” suggests the possibility of it resuming later. But as long as I don’t take any more drugs, I should be fine. I have no intention of taking them, so I’ll be okay.\n\"I’m sorry for attacking you. Really, I’m sorry. I’ll never do it again. I’m sorry.\"\nI know that this apology isn’t enough. I’ll find a way to repay him someday.\n\"I’m normal now. I won’t hold you back anymore.\"\nHan Si-Hoo doesn’t respond to my apology. He just stares at me with a cold expression. Is he that angry? Of course, he is. I did try to kill him. It doesn’t seem like he’s willing to accept my apology.\n\"It’s fine.\"\nSomething feels off. The atmosphere is different from usual. Han Si-Hoo reaches out his hand, but then it stops near my neck.\n\"...Step away from me. My current state is... strange.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"It’s a skill’s side effect. Right now, there’s a chance I might attack you. Sorry, but stay away.\"\nHan Si-Hoo speaks with his eyes closed. If he’s saying this, then something must be wrong.\n\"Okay, I’ll come back later.\"\nOf course, there had to be a price. This world is particularly harsh when it comes to healing. External wounds can be treated quickly, but that’s about it. If you don’t get treated quickly, even those become hard to heal. Internal injuries or invisible illnesses are beyond the scope of an Awakened’s abilities. That’s usually the case. Though I’ve heard of exceptional healers who can bypass such limitations.\nBut Han Si-Hoo isn’t known for healing abilities. He’s more focused on combat. And yet, he somehow managed to heal me completely. He mentioned a side effect from his skill. It must be related to the purification skill.\n\"Hold on.\"\nHe speaks, covering his eyes with his arm. It seems like he shouldn’t be looking at me.\n\"Just a moment... where were you before you came here?\"\n\"I was in the medical ward downstairs.\"\n\"Oh, I see. With who?\"\n\"The doctor.\"\n\"...Doctor?\"\n\"Yeah, I saw him again after a long time.\"\nNow that I say it out loud, something feels off. Did Han Si-Hoo dislike the doctor? There must be some misunderstanding. The doctor’s a good person.\n\"Teacher Lee Yoo-Ram?\"\n\"Huh? No.\"\n\"Then who?\"\n\"You’ve seen him before too. When we first arrived at the academy... Now that I think about it, we haven’t seen him since then.\"\nHan Si-Hoo lowers the arm that was covering his face.\n\"...Who?\"\n\"You know, the one who used to give me the drugs.\"\n\"The doctor... was with you?\"\n\"Yeah. If there’s some misunderstanding about him, you should clear it up...\"\nMisunderstanding? What am I even saying? There must have been a reason for him to be seen as an enemy. Suddenly, I don’t know why I feel so positive about the doctor. I haven’t even used any drugs.\n[Paused]\n\"...Ah. Is that so.\"\nAt some point, Han Si-Hoo opened his eyes. He looks at the needle marks on my arm and lets out a deep sigh.\n\"So, no matter how many times it repeats, it’s always the same.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Of course. It’s delusional to think we could go back to how things were. Isn’t it? Shut up, will you?\"\nHe’s scaring me. Is he talking to himself? I’ve never seen Han Si-Hoo mutter like this before.\n\"No matter how many times I purify you, if you use the drugs again, you’ll go right back.\"\n\"I won’t use them anymore.\"\nI don’t plan to take the drugs again, even if the doctor offers them.\n\"The drugs came from the doctor, but I don’t need them anymore. I’m not in pain, so I don’t need them.\"\nI’m rambling.\n\"Anyway, you don’t need to worry—\"\nHan Si-Hoo doesn’t respond. He just steps closer and reaches out his hand. A handshake?\n\"Ka-huk.\"\nHe grabs my neck. I can’t pry his hand off. Just as I start to lose consciousness, Han Si-Hoo lets go, giving me a moment to breathe.\n\"Ah, ha...\"\nHe seems really angry. That’s the look of someone who’s truly disgusted. Now I understand how terrifying Han Si-Hoo can be when he’s your enemy.\nI never thought he would get this angry. Is it because of the skill’s side effects? He did say there was a chance he might attack me. Or did I say something wrong? Was it the mention of the doctor?\n[Paused]\n\"Wait, just—\"\nHe grabs my neck again. With one hand. It felt like everything would go back to normal as long as Han Si-Hoo stayed okay. But things don’t work out that conveniently.\nThe price for restoring a completely broken Yoo Seo-Ah. If Han Si-Hoo is the one who gets broken instead, so be it. I remember now. I finally recall what the purification skill is.\n\"Hah, ha, haah.\"\nI gasp for breath, feeling dizzy. My vision starts to turn white.\n\"I should have done this from the start.\"\nHan Si-Hoo watches me with a blank expression, as if this situation doesn’t faze him at all.\nI’m paying for my sins. For living like trash, I suppose.\n\"I’m sorry.\"\nIt’s only right to apologize. Han Si-Hoo doesn’t respond.\nI’m not sure if this is really Han Si-Hoo. He seems like how I was when I was on the drugs. Now I see, he’s been dealing with someone like that this whole time. Han Si-Hoo must have had a hard time.\n\"If only you’d had the sense to disappear, none of this would have happened.\"\nThat’s true. It really is.\n\"You know, do you still find Han Si-Hoo scary? Even though you’re clinging to him like this?\"\nI’m only just starting to feel scared.\n\"And the doctor? Is he your good friend?\"\nHe’s not a friend, but he’s a good person. Isn’t he?\n\"Didn’t you say this hurt?\"\nHe pokes my stomach.\n\"Ugh?\"\n\"Tell me, what kind of life do you lead to get injuries like that?\"\nThat’s something Han Si-Hoo would never ask. Something he would never do.\n\"Did you sell your body? Even if not, it wouldn’t be surprising if something happened to you.\"\nFor a moment, my mind went blank.\n\"No, that’s not it.\"\nIt’s the first time anyone’s asked me something so blunt. But I understand. The environment, the circumstances are all a mess. It wouldn’t be strange if someone thought that.\n\"It’s really not.\"\nI hadn’t fallen that far.\n-Thud.\n\"Kuh-huk.\"\nIt hurts. It hurts. It hurts so much. It hurts, hurts, hurts.\nHe kicked me in the stomach. I open my eyes to find myself collapsed on the floor.\nDrugs. If I had them, it wouldn’t hurt as much. It’s been a long time since I’ve felt pain this intense, and I can’t get used to it. No, I don’t need the drugs anymore.\n[Paused]\nI used to take them because I didn’t have enough time. Now I have no reason to use them.\nBut it hurts. I hate being in pain. Why did he hit me? I don’t understand.\n\"-W-what are you doing?\"\nThat voice isn’t mine. Yeon-Hwa came back into the room.\n\"You hit her?\"\nShe looks confused. But Han Si-Hoo only stares at me. I need to explain.\nCough. I keep coughing until I can finally speak.\nThis is a misunderstanding. Really. If I had spoken up earlier, I could have explained it somehow. Most of the scars on my body are self-inflicted. It’s not that big of a deal.\nBut it hurts. I think something’s broken. I don’t want to be hit anymore.\nI can’t make sense of what’s happening. What’s going on?\nWeren’t they friends? Did Si-Hoo hit her? Well, to be fair, she did try to kill him. I can understand why he’d be angry. Even I felt angry enough to want to kill her.\nBut Si-Hoo didn’t look like he was angry at all. I thought maybe they had a special bond as friends. Whatever happened between them, I assumed they would resolve it on their own.\n\"I-I swear, it's not like that.\"\nYoo Seo-Ah's eyes are welling up with tears. Is it because of the pain, or is she just sad? I don’t know what she’s trying to deny.\n\"I didn’t sell my body.\"\nWhat is she even trying to explain?\n\"I’ve never done that. Really, I haven’t.\"\nShe speaks in a panicked voice. A girl from the slums. For a girl living in such a place, it wouldn’t be surprising if she had done something dirty. That’s how I had been thinking all along. But seeing Yoo Seo-Ah in front of me now, I realize something is very wrong.\nHow could a girl her age say something like that?\nWhat? Does she really need to defend herself by saying she hasn’t sold her body? What is this? Is this hell?\nA normal girl wouldn’t be in a situation like this. When I first saw her smiling, she just seemed like a regular girl.\n\"I’ve never done anything like that.\"\nThe anger I’d built up from hearing that she tried to kill Si-Hoo was overwhelming. But as my anger subsides, I can see Yoo Seo-Ah more clearly. Her arms, hidden beneath her sleeves, are covered in scars as if she had been slashed repeatedly. Her body is full of needle marks.\nI thought it was her own fault. Just looking at the state of her dorm room, with syringes scattered everywhere... I thought she was just a filthy addict. The kind of trash who would even try to kill her friend.\nShe’s crouched on the floor in pain.\nThere’s no way she would have wanted this for herself.\n\"Stop it...\"\nSi-Hoo doesn’t look normal either. His eyes are shaking. As if he didn’t mean for this to happen, he steps back, looking unsettled. His expression is strained. He tries to cover his eyes with his hand.\nSi-Hoo has been acting strange for a while. Talking about strange numbers, going back and forth between states of mind. Still, when Yoo Seo-Ah appeared, I gave them space, thinking they could talk it out.\nI need to find a way to stop this. But I don’t know how. I didn’t expect things to turn out like this, and now my mind is frozen.\nCrack.\n\"Si-Hoo!\"\nSi-Hoo grabs the sword that had been resting against the side of his bed. He throws aside the scabbard and grabs the blade with his bare hand. Blood flows down from his palm.\n\"Ah, that feels better.\"\n\"What... what are you doing?\"\nSelf-harm. I can see the sharp metal cutting into his palm.\n\"Sorry. Take Seo-Ah and get her out of here.\"\nHe’s still covering his eyes with one hand.\n\"I’ll pull myself together somehow.\"",

      "content": "Yeah, get a hold of yourself. Han Si-Hoo muttered to himself. He kept muttering it. He’d already repeated it dozens of times.\nHe had never experienced his mind being so invaded like this before. In the end, he only hurt Seo-Ah again. It was only after Yeon-Hwa took her away that his mind started to clear.\nHe couldn’t even remember what he had said to Seo-Ah. His thoughts were still in a fog. He needed to find a way to stop this penalty.\nClenching the sword blade with his bare hand, he kept himself grounded. Maybe this was a method he had unconsciously picked up from Seo-Ah. The first thing he needed to do was clear.\n\"The doctor.\"\nIf the doctor really had infiltrated the academy, he needed to be caught now. Especially now, when most of the academy’s forces were deployed elsewhere. There was no one to help him. In the end, only Han Si-Hoo could kill the doctor.\nWhere did he say he was? It was nearby for sure.\n\"If I can just deal with the doctor...\"\nThen Seo-Ah would be safe. Han Si-Hoo properly gripped his sword. This time, he wouldn’t fail.\nWas the doctor an Awakened too? Probably. He had already seen that the doctor could teleport or move remotely, whether it was via some form of portal or instant movement. But beyond that, his abilities were still unknown.\nHe had to act now.\nHe remembered. The doctor was said to be in the medical ward downstairs. The academy building was sturdy, but Han Si-Hoo could break through it.\nBang!\nHe slammed his fist into the floor, shattering it. With the help of his skills, this much was possible. He created a path to the lower floor.\nJumping down, he scanned the area. No patients in sight. Dust filled the air. The ceiling lights flickered, sending off sparks.\n\"Oh...\"\nThe doctor let out an impressed sound.\n\"I thought Seo-Ah would be the first to arrive, but it’s you.\"\nThe doctor’s voice was relaxed. As if he had been expecting Han Si-Hoo to come.\n\"Doctor.\"\nHe didn’t know the doctor’s real name. Didn’t know where he came from. Didn’t know why he was here. There were too many unknowns.\nHan Si-Hoo suppressed his instinct to attack, choosing instead to ask a question.\n\"Who are you?\"\nInformation gathering was important. He needed to know who his enemy was. It was doubtful the doctor would answer, but he asked anyway. At the same time, he scrutinized the doctor’s appearance.\n\"I’m a doctor.\"\nA meaningless answer.\n\"Why did you mess with Seo-Ah?\"\nHan Si-Hoo prepared to attack.\n\"I do not neglect any patient. Seo-Ah had no hospital to go to, no doctor to turn to.\"\nThe doctor answered.\n\"Tell me what your goal is.\"\nIt was rare for someone to give a straightforward answer in situations like this. But the doctor seemed willing to explain. Though Han Si-Hoo couldn’t see the doctor’s expression, it felt like he was smiling.\nSlash.\nThe spot where the doctor had been standing was cleanly sliced. But there was no damage.\n\"An illusion...?\"\nHan Si-Hoo had already noticed how faint the doctor’s presence had felt. There was no real substance.\n\"A hologram.\"\nHe spotted the hologram projector. When he messed with the device, the doctor’s image disappeared. But the voice continued. Speakers and microphones were installed somewhere nearby.\n\"I’m not particularly strong, so I have to rely on measures like this.\"\n\"Where are you?\"\nThat familiar unease. A bad feeling he couldn’t shake. He had to check on Seo-Ah’s location.\n\"I’m on my way to meet a patient.\"\n\"Don’t you dare touch Seo-Ah.\"\nHe had asked Yeon-Hwa to take Seo-Ah somewhere safe. They had left the medical ward not long ago. They should still be in the building.\nBut Seo-Ah is trash. It wouldn’t hurt to leave her behind. This is a good opportunity. I could fix everything that’s gone wrong because of her.\nShut up. Shut up, please. Han Si-Hoo muttered to himself, trying to keep his sanity. He wasn’t in his right mind.\n\"I had entrusted Seo-Ah to you, believing you to be her guardian. But it seems you aren’t suited for that role.\"\nNot suited to be her guardian? Maybe not. But it wasn’t the doctor’s place to make that judgment.\n\"My goal is to treat the patient.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Since you’re also a patient, my goal is to provide comprehensive treatment for both of you.\"\nHe was treating Han Si-Hoo as a patient too. It was as if the doctor lived in a completely different reality from Han Si-Hoo’s.\n\"What are you talking about?\"\nNone of this made sense.\n\"Yes. Normally, you wouldn’t understand. But we are in a state of emergency now, so...\"\nThe doctor trailed off.\n\"-Ah, Miss Yeon-Hwa. How nice to meet you.\"\nThe greeting came through the speakers. No, this couldn’t be right. Something was definitely wrong. Yeon-Hwa was with Seo-Ah.\nSeo-Ah could barely move on her own. She was like a crushed ant on the verge of death. That was where she belonged.\nWhere is Seo-Ah? I need to find her. Then I can crush her myself.\n\"Damn it. Get it together.\"\nThere had to be a way to fix this mental corruption. There had to be a way to remove the penalty.\nBut first, Seo-Ah. He had to find Seo-Ah. But if he saw her in this state... He would want to kill her.\nIt felt like his mind was being taken over. Was this how Seo-Ah felt when she was on the drugs? It seemed like he was finally getting a taste of what it was like.\n-Bang.\nThe speakers emitted a loud, screeching sound. It helped him regain his focus.\n\"...Huh?\"\n\"Have you ever wondered why Awakened don’t carry guns? Why such a powerful weapon is banned?\"\nThe speaker’s quality had dropped significantly. Static filled the air.\n\"That’s because if you were to use guns, it would be too threatening. They’re banned because they aren’t effective against monsters.\"\n\"Guns...?\"\nHan Si-Hoo tried to focus on his task. Where had that gunshot come from? The speaker had been loud, but the real gunshot had been even louder. It had definitely come from nearby.\nThe doctor. Who was he shooting at?\n-Bang!\nAnother shot rang out. He could tell where it came from now. Han Si-Hoo prepared to leap out the window. Since becoming an Awakened, such feats had become effortless. Jumping between windows was nothing.\n\"I found you.\"\nHan Si-Hoo had a good grasp of the academy’s layout. He jumped out the window.\nIt hurts. The pain is getting worse by the minute.\nIf I took the drugs, I’d be fine. But I can endure this much. If I wait, it’ll get better.\nBut I really didn’t sell my body or anything like that. It’s frustrating. Sure, Si-Hoo’s acting weird, so he might say things like that. But that’s not true. That never happened.\nMy vision is turning white.\nWhat if I can’t remember it happening? No, there’s no way it did. I would’ve known if I’d taken money for something like that. Aha. Then maybe I didn’t need to go to Si-Hoo in the first place.\nDid he want to ask why I didn’t just sell my body instead of coming to him? Or did he think I earned money like that before asking him for help? Now that I think about it, I never paid back the money I borrowed.\nI feel like throwing up. Honestly, I can’t even move. I can’t straighten my body.\n\"Ah, Miss Yeon-Hwa. Nice to see you.\"\nI hear the doctor’s voice. He knows her name? But judging by Yeon-Hwa’s expression, she doesn’t seem to know him.\nThe doctor pulls out a gun.\nA gun? Why?\nBang!\nThe gunshot was louder than I expected. I don’t know why he’s shooting, but Yeon-Hwa blocked it. She’s already holding a sword in each hand, ready to fight. In this world, it’s possible to deflect bullets with a sword.\n\"Have you ever wondered why Awakened don’t carry guns? Why such a powerful weapon is banned?\"\n\"Stay back. I’ll handle this.\"\nFor Awakened, a regular gun won’t kill them. They won’t even get hit.\nI don’t understand why the doctor is attacking Yeon-Hwa. None of this makes sense. Maybe it’s the pain making it harder to comprehend.\n\"That’s because if you were to use guns, it would be too threatening. They’re banned because they aren’t effective against monsters.\"\nFor something supposedly ineffective, that gun seems pretty dangerous. Yeon-Hwa’s blocking the bullets without a problem, though.\nBang.\nAnother shot is fired. Yeon-Hwa deflects it again.\n\"Of course, I know regular guns won’t work.\"\nThe doctor’s voice grows faint.\nI glance up at the doctor’s face. He’s wearing a gas mask. That’s why his voice sounds muffled. I hadn’t noticed when he put it on.\n\"Ugh.\"\nYeon-Hwa covers her mouth. Her stance crumbles in an instant. It looks like there was a reason the doctor wore a gas mask.\n\"Such fragility.\"\nYeon-Hwa collapses, helpless. Now it’s just me. I don’t feel anything. The doctor must have released some kind of gas. I’m not wearing a gas mask, but I can breathe just fine.\n\"Ah, don’t worry. This is nothing to worry about. You’re immune because of the military-grade drugs.\"\nSo, it’s because I took the drugs. Of course. Drugs really are good after all.\n\"Still, staying here for too long isn’t a good idea. We should get going.\"\nBang!\nSuddenly, the wall bursts open. It’s Han Si-Hoo. Blood is dripping from the hand that holds his sword. He’s clearly not in a good state.\n\"Ah, are we fighting here? You arrived quickly.\"\nIs Han Si-Hoo protecting me? He looks like he’s deciding whether to kill the doctor or me first. Yeon-Hwa is passed out on the ground near me. He won’t attack this side... right?\nI’m worried. After all, just a little while ago, Han Si-Hoo tried to attack me. Even if it wasn’t on purpose, it was still terrifying.\n\"You can’t lay a hand on Seo-Ah.\"\nAt least he isn’t trying to kill me. Han Si-Hoo fixed his grip on his sword, glaring at the doctor.\n\"[Purification].\"\nThe gas didn’t seem to affect him. Could his skill even purify the air? That’s impressive.\n\"It’s always fascinating how the Awakened can make even their wordplay a reality.\"\nSomething rolls out from the doctor’s sleeve.\n-Kiiing.\nA deafening explosion of light follows. I can’t hear anything. The flash is so bright I can’t see a thing. A flashbang.\nI think I hear a few more gunshots. I feel something hit me.\nAnd then I feel myself being pulled away by someone.",

It was absurd.\nSome places were so underdeveloped they couldn’t even use electricity, yet here, advanced technology like holograms just popped up.\nIncredible.\n\"Here he is.\"\nAs the smoke clears slightly, the figure of the doctor emerges.\nThis time, Han Si-Hoo had to attack properly.\nHe was confident in sweeping through a wide area.\nBut thinking of Seo-Ah and Yeon-Hwa, such a skill couldn’t be used.\n\"[Please remain still.]\"\nWas this an attempt to stop his attack?\nIt seemed like a skill that carried power through words.\n\"Shut up.\"\nIt didn’t work on Han Si-Hoo.\nWithout hesitation, he slashed.\nNo restrictions were placed on his movements.\nThis time, he felt his blade cutting through something.\nIt wasn’t as deep as it appeared, but one more strike would be enough.\nIn terms of combat skills, the doctor might be weak.\nHe had used petty tricks, but now it was over.\nFaster.\nStronger.\nHis blade pierced through again.\nBut again, because of the smoke, it was shallower than it seemed.\nOnce more.\nHe could feel the opponent collapsing.\nYet, the doctor still stood.\nThere was no sign of the doctor’s form breaking apart.\nNot even slightly.\n\"A hologram?\"\nIt wasn’t the real body.\nBut he was sure there had been a hit.\n\"Seo-Ah?\"\nThe one who stood frozen in place was Seo-Ah.\nThe command to stop was aimed at Yoo Seo-Ah.\nOnly then did Han Si-Hoo realize what had happened.\nIt wasn’t the doctor who was attacked.\nHe had been cutting and stabbing, aiming for the doctor.\nBut now Seo-Ah’s gaze was growing dim as she looked at him.\nIt was a fittingly miserable end.\nLet her die like that.\nThe doctor would take care of the body anyway.\nNo, shut up. Kill him.\nHan Si-Hoo was failing to maintain his composure.\nBecause he kept finding himself in the same situation.\nOver and over.\nEver since he had abandoned Seo-Ah once.\nAbandoned?\nHe didn’t abandon her.\nHe hadn’t left her behind because he wanted to.\nAll the decisions he made, trying to respect Seo-Ah, had turned into poison.\nSo wasn’t Seo-Ah really the problem?\nOr perhaps Han Si-Hoo himself was.\nBoth were certainly at fault.\n\"Ah...\"\nEven while looking at Seo-Ah, he felt the killing intent rising.\nHe had to take action, but he couldn’t.He had to kill the doctor.\nBut the penalty was too great.\nEven so, he couldn’t crumble here.\nWhy couldn’t he crumble?\nFor whom?\nWhy had things come to this?\n\"As you can see, I don’t have any particular intention of killing you. If I did, I had more than enough chances.\"\nThe doctor spoke.\nBecause of the gas mask, his expression couldn’t be seen.\n\"But if Seo-Ah wishes, there’s always euthanasia, you know.\"\nThe doctor made a show of listening.\nSeo-Ah was saying something.\nBlood was gushing from her mouth as she tried to speak.\nWhat was she saying?\nHan Si-Hoo thought he knew.\nShe was probably just asking to be killed.\nSeo-Ah smiled at Han Si-Hoo.\nIt seemed the doctor had heard her answer.\n\"In that case, like this.\"\nHe put the gun to Seo-Ah’s head.\nBang.\nWhat had once been Yoo Seo-Ah fell to the floor.\nPeople die so easily.\nBang. Bang. Bang.\nThere was no more response.\nThe doctor pulled the trigger without hesitation.\nAll of this happened before Han Si-Hoo could even grasp the situation.\n\"Let’s end it here. This building is rather old and weak. There were discussions about rebuilding, but...\"\nHan Si-Hoo couldn’t understand what had happened.\nThere was no way Seo-Ah was dead.\nSo easily?\nIt didn’t make sense in the context.\nIt couldn’t be true.\n\"In my opinion, now seems like the right time.\"\nWhat was so appropriate about now? Han Si-Hoo couldn’t comprehend.\nThe doctor had killed Seo-Ah.\nWhy?\nBoom!\nThe entire hallway collapsed.\nBoom!\nThe explosions didn’t stop.\nIt felt as if the entire building was falling down.\nIt couldn’t be.\nThere was no way Seo-Ah was dead.\nThe last thing Han Si-Hoo had done was stab her.\nIt’s not over yet.\n\"No.\"\nThis kind of ending couldn’t happen.\nThinking logically, the doctor could have killed Seo-Ah at any time.\nThe fact that the academy couldn’t even provide basic protection was unexpected.\nFrom the start, Han Si-Hoo had never been capable.\nThat’s the truth.\nNo matter how many monsters Han Si-Hoo killed, he could only handle those at an appropriate level.\nIt was no different from a game.\nIf the final boss made a preemptive strike in the early stages, there was no way to win.\nThe doctor was close to a boss monster.\nEven so, Han Si-Hoo wouldn’t lose in a fight against him now.\nIt was just difficult to protect everyone perfectly.\nSeo-Ah was dead?\nIt had to be a lie.\nThe ceiling had collapsed, and neither the doctor nor Seo-Ah could be seen.\nHe hadn’t been able to protect her.\nNo, but there was still someone left to protect.He knew.\nThis was an important moment, so he had to do what needed to be done.\nHe had to save Yeon-Hwa at least.\nHan Si-Hoo lifted the fallen Yeon-Hwa in his arms.\nHe couldn’t pick up the swords lying on the ground.\nHer long black hair brushed against his hands.\nIt was a familiar scene.\nHe had saved Yeon-Hwa from danger before.\nThe reason she only used formal speech with others but spoke casually to Han Si-Hoo.\nBut was this really the right thing?\nHe knew saving people was the right thing to do.\nThat was obvious.\nBut Seo-Ah seemed to be dead.\nOf course, it had to be a joke.\nIt had to be a mistake.\nIt couldn’t have been that easy.\nNo, it didn’t make sense.\nStill, he had made a few friends, hadn’t he?\nHe had gotten to know people.\nIn the future, something might happen with Seo-Ah that would create a meaningful event.\nThings might be awkward now, but it would be different later.\nSeo-Ah might be suffering now, but in the future, everything would be okay.\nA future much better than this.\nA future.\nA future.\nA future.\nNone.\n[Achievement: 100% Awakening Rate Reached!]\nIn reality, it wasn’t that strange.\nThe world doesn’t change just because one or two people die.\nYoo Seo-Ah was high-risk.\nIt wasn’t surprising she had died.\nBut up until now, Han Si-Hoo hadn’t lost anyone around him.\nWhenever his friends were in danger, he saved them all.\nThere was always a chance to win during battle.\nSo, based on that flow, everything should have turned out for the better.\nWhat’s commonly referred to as a happy ending.\nBut Yoo Seo-Ah was headed in the opposite direction.\nSome people have good friends, and some are surrounded by bad ones.\nSome have good luck, others bad.\nOne side ends in success, the other in failure.\nA bright future or none at all.\nIn the end, Seo-Ah had won.\nNo matter what Han Si-Hoo tried to do, it would end in ruin.\nEven if he tried to stop it, both would just end up broken.\nWere these dark thoughts because of the penalty?\nNo matter how much Han Si-Hoo thought about it, there was no answer.\nIn the end, it didn’t matter whether he found an answer or not.\nBecause Han Si-Hoo had realized one thing.\nJust power.\nHe needed power.\nHe abandoned Seo-Ah because he lacked power.\nHe couldn’t protect her because he wasn’t strong enough.\nHe couldn’t even protect his reason for protecting her.\nWeakness itself.\nIt was the fault of his environment, his parents who had abandoned him, the oppressive society, the exploitative humans.\nIf he wanted to blame something, he could blame everything around him.\nBut what if he had been just a bit stronger?\nWhat if he had been stronger?\nHe should have been stronger.\nHan Si-Hoo muttered endlessly.\nHe wasn’t just talking about physical strength.\nThe doctor had something more.\nHe had the talent to deceive and manipulate people.\nHe possessed an overwhelming amount of information.\nHan Si-Hoo was still just a student.\nAnd just a kid from the slums who had only begun to gain footing.\nIf things happened before his growth narrative was complete, there was no way to stop them.\nSeo-Ah’s death had become a driving force for his growth.\nPeople need unshakable pillars.\nA solid wall that doesn’t abandon anyone.\n\"Si-Hoo?\"\n\"...Yeah.\"\nRena was beside him.\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nHe didn’t understand what she was apologizing for.\nIt still didn’t make sense to him.\nThere was no way Seo-Ah was dead.\nIt couldn’t be.\n\"You know, that drug... it seems some military units have been using it. It was strange for the academy to supply something like that. I should have known earlier.\"\nShe had been investigating the drug.\nThinking back, Han Si-Hoo had asked for the drug Seo-Ah was using to be investigated.\nHe had asked Lee Yoo-Ram.\nBut no results had ever come back.\nLee Yoo-Ram had no interest in treating Seo-Ah.\nFrom the beginning, Seo-Ah was just a research subject to her.\nHan Si-Hoo needed to find out where the drug had come from.\nWere there others in a similar situation as Seo-Ah?\nPeople who needed to be protected.\nIronically, just protecting them wouldn’t be enough to save them all.\nWith enough power, he could annihilate everything.\nThe first step was eliminating the dangerous factors.\n\"Lee Yoo-Ram is strange too. The whole academy... why is it like this? If the other teachers knew, who can we even trust?\"\n\"We need to find out who’s behind this.\"\n\"...Behind this?\"\n\"Lee Yoo-Ram couldn't have gotten the drug on her own.\"\nWas it the doctor?\nWhoever had given the drug to Lee Yoo-Ram?\nHan Si-Hoo knew Lee Yoo-Ram had a younger sister.\nShe thought she had hidden it well, but she hadn’t.\nIn the end, the problem was trusting Lee Yoo-Ram.\nHe had never heard anything about military drugs being used on Seo-Ah.\nFor Lee Yoo-Ram, what mattered was not some stranger like Seo-Ah, but her own sister.\nHan Si-Hoo understood.\nEveryone values their own family above everything.\n\"I’ll figure it out soon.\"\nIt felt strange to think he was learning from the doctor’s actions, but there was a way.\nIf he took Lee Yoo-Ram’s sister hostage, that would be enough.\nHe already knew where she was.\nThe tracking device he had planted on Lee Yoo-Ram’s bag had come in handy.\nThe doctor hadn’t hesitated to use advanced technology, and now Han Si-Hoo had learned from him.\nThe doctor had done underhanded things, so Han Si-Hoo learned from him too.\nIn a way, the doctor was like a father to him.\nHe was like a parent who had appeared in Han Si-Hoo’s life when he was an orphan.\nWhy did the doctor kill Seo-Ah?\nHan Si-Hoo cried for a long time.\nOf course, he was still young.\nEven adults cry when they lose family.\nDue to the immense responsibility and pressure building up in his life, Han Si-Hoo had never shed a tear.\nThere was a time long ago when he had cried before.\nHe couldn’t remember the reason.\nHe recalled Seo-Ah patting him on the back, telling him it would be okay.\n\"It’s okay. It’s okay.\"\nWhat else had she said?\n\"I’ll always be with you.\"\nYou can rely on me.\nShe smiled softly.\nBang.\nThe doctor had shot her.\nHan Si-Hoo had to kill the doctor.",

Got it?\"\nSeo-Ah was already at the finish line, waving from a distance.\nIt was Han Si-Hoo’s turn.\nThis was an even older memory.\nA memory without any need to worry about drugs.\nOf course.How far back do I have to go?\nEvery time he thought of Seo-Ah’s smiling face in the past, he wondered if she had really enjoyed being with him.\n\"Ah, look at that.\"\nShe looked up at the sky.\n\"The clouds are all gone. So many stars.\"\nWere they?\nHan Si-Hoo looked up at the sky.\nThere were still clouds.\nIt was still the city.\nCars were everywhere on the streets.\nThe \"don’t step on the ground\" game.\nHonestly, it wasn’t that fun of a game.\nIt was just fun because he was playing it with a friend.\nSeo-Ah blocked the moonlight with her hand, trying to get a better view of the faint starlight.\n\"Ah, if you look from this angle, you’ll see them better.\"\nBang.\nAnd then Seo-Ah said nothing more.\nI should have stopped it.\nI could have stopped it.\nHow?\nIf he went to the academy, he could make money.\nWith that money, Seo-Ah could live somewhere better.\nBut Seo-Ah told him not to come.\nShe told him not to come into the house, so he waited outside for hours before leaving.\nWhen she said she was disgusted, it hurt a little.\nWould things have been better if he hadn’t gone back to the academy?\nWhich part of it?\nShe was already addicted to the drugs—how could anything be okay?\nWas it okay just because he managed to make enough money to give her for the drugs?\nWhere did it go wrong?\nNo matter what choices he made, it seemed like nothing but bad things came of them.\nWhere, where, and which choice should he have changed?\nThe academy seemed like it treated him well.\nThere were some unsettling aspects, but still.\nHe believed it would be a good shelter until they found a better solution.\nBut all they did was stick more drugs into Seo-Ah and run tests.\nEven the trauma tests they weren’t supposed to do—those were disgusting.\nStill, wasn’t it an institution meant to protect humanity?\nA place to protect citizens.\nThey only justified everything they did under the guise of \"for humanity’s sake.\"\nAnd yet, the doctor was freely walking around.\nNo one was protecting them.\nBecause everyone was too busy trying to protect themselves.\nForgetting the fact that this place was already rotten was a mistake.\nA mistake.\nI was wrong.\nSorry.\nThat’s why learning is necessary.\nTo learn, you must reflect.\nWhat went wrong and what was right.\nHow to fix things.\nIt was just a lack of strength.\nPower.\n\"Si-Hoo.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"Practicing my swordsmanship.\"\n\"Again today?\"\nIt was just a metal rod in his hand, but if he swung it properly, it became a sword.\nThe more he practiced, the better he got.\nIf he had had a teacher, he would have learned faster, but even self-study led to growth.\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Who are you going to hit?\"\nThat sounded strange.\n\"I’m not hitting anyone.\"\n\"Hmm?\"\n\"I’m only going to deal with bad people.\"\nHe had known for a long time that he needed strength.\n\"I see.\"\nSeo-Ah knew it too.\nThat they needed strength to survive.\n\"We might end up having to fight real monsters.\"\nThere might come a time when they had to deal with dungeons or gates.\nWhen the air raid sirens went off, all they could do was run.\nBut someday, the time to fight would come.\n\"That’s scary.\"\nHe swung the sword.\nThen thrust it forward.\n\"Still, there might be a more peaceful way than fighting.\"\nIt wasn’t as if they could talk things out with monsters.\nWhen you have to protect, you have to protect.\nBut just protecting isn’t enough.\nYou have to eliminate the cause.\nSo he slashed and stabbed.\n\"Peace?\"\n\"Yeah. You might get hurt if you keep fighting.\"\n\"......\"\n\"You saw it, didn’t you? People getting hurt in fights.\"\nWhen was that?\nHe had seen people fighting each other.\nHe had seen them fighting things that weren’t human.\n\"I’ll only fight when it’s necessary.\"\nThere were times when it was necessary.\nThere are moments when a fight is justified.\nHan Si-Hoo had never gotten hurt.\nHe was becoming a hero who never lost.\nSo he slashed with the sword.\nCutting down the enemy without hesitation.\nFor some reason, there was blood on his blade.\nIt wasn’t just the air he was cutting.\nHis heart pounded.\nThere was ringing in his ears.\n\"Was I the bad person?\"\nHe had only tried to kill the doctor.\n\"Was I the monster?\"\nWas that what she wanted to say?\nEverything overlapped in his mind.\nFrom the young Seo-Ah to the version of her who had been struck by Han Si-Hoo’s blade.\nHe didn’t want to hear it.\nDid he really have to listen to his childhood friend explain that she hadn’t sold her body?\nChoking her, kicking her.\nHonestly, even the worst villains don’t treat their family like that.\nNo one in their right mind could do such a thing.\nThat shouldn’t happen.\nIt couldn’t happen.\nHe didn’t want to hurt Seo-Ah anymore.\nBang.\nSo the doctor shot her.\nNom.\nThey were back to the ice cream.\nSeo-Ah was eating it with delight.\n\"Should we get one more...?\"\nThey didn’t have much money left.\nBut it was rare for them to buy a treat like this.\n\"Should we?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nThere was a new ice cream they hadn’t seen before.\n\"It’s tuna-flavored ice cream!\"\n\"Tuna... flavor? What’s that supposed to taste like?\"\nThere were a lot of cans of tuna at home because Seo-Ah liked them.\nIf they were looking for cheap food, there were plenty of other options.\nEven canned food wasn’t that cheap.\n\"Let’s try it!\"\nShe smiled brightly.\nWell, the tuna ice cream tasted like tuna.\nIt was so fishy that even Seo-Ah couldn’t finish it and spat it out.\nLater, they found out it had been released as a joke for a short time.\nThough it wasn’t entirely inedible.\n\"...It was fun, right?\"\nHaha.\nThey laughed together.\nHe never understood how she could always laugh like that.\nThe world was bleak.\nEverything was a mess.\nThere wasn’t a single optimistic thing to hold on to in this world.\n\"Why would anyone freeze tuna?\"\nGood question.\n\"I think I’ll be okay without eating tuna for a while.\"\n\"Me too.\"\nThe streets on the way home were crumbling.\nEveryone had left, and only dust remained.\nOccasionally, stray animals wandered around.\n\"Do you know what kind of flower this is?\"\nSeo-Ah pointed to a flower that was a mix of red and white.\n\"What is it?\"\n\"Hmm? I don’t know either.\"\n\"It’s probably a carnation.\"\n\"What? You knew? No wonder it looked like those paper carnations people make.\"\n\"Yeah. It’s a carnation.\"\nHe remembered seeing it in some flower encyclopedia Seo-Ah had picked up.\nHe had forgotten the meaning behind it, but at least he remembered the name.\n\"Maybe someone planted it and then left. Feels kind of lonely.\"\n\"They must have moved a long time ago.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nMoving.\nHe had thought for a while that they would have to move someday.\nHan Si-Hoo knew that living in the slums was dangerous.\nBut they had nowhere else to go.\nWithout money, they couldn’t live under the city’s protection.\n\"I wonder if we’ll ever live in a nice house.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Though honestly, this is good enough for me.\"\nSeo-Ah didn’t seem to have any attachment to their home.\nShe only brought it up because Han Si-Hoo had mentioned moving before.\n\"...If you’re happy, I’m happy too.\"\nHan Si-Hoo spoke.\nIt was a rare, somewhat embarrassing thing for him to say.\n\"Haha...\"\nShe laughed.\nAnd they walked a little farther.\n\"Si-Hoo.\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"Do you think we’ll always be able to stay together?\"\nThere was a hint of unease in her voice.\nEven though she was smiling, the atmosphere felt heavier.\n\"Of course.\"\n\"I hope so.\"\nBut there was nothing to worry about.\nHe would never leave Seo-Ah behind.\nAs long as that didn’t happen, there would be no problems.\nThe thing Seo-Ah worried about would never happen.\nNever.\nIt couldn’t.\n\"...Still. There might come a time when we’re apart for a little while, or we can’t see each other.\"\nSeo-Ah said.\nThinking realistically about the future, she wasn’t wrong.\nThere was some doubt about whether they could always stay together.\nBut he still wanted to be with her.\n\"But we’ll meet again. So let’s cheer each other on, no matter where we are.\"\nSeo-Ah said that with a smile.\n\"Will that day really come?\"\nIt was hard to imagine.\n\"The world is big. Someday.\"\nShe said something like that, talking about how they would chase their dreams.\nThe sun was beginning to set.\nThe clouds looked like giant cotton candy.\nThe sky was turning orange with hints of pink.\nFor a moment, they stopped and stared at the sky.\nEveryone around them was probably admiring the same view.",

Seo-Ah is not beside him.\nHe should have just stayed with her.\nDrugs or not, if it was an unsolvable problem, being together would have been better.\nOf course, he had wanted that.\nHan Si-Hoo wasn’t keen on entering the academy either.\nThis is how the story began.\nFirst of all, they didn’t have any money.\nMoney was always scarce.\nBut then Seo-Ah got sick.\nEven a few thousand or tens of thousands of won for medicine was a huge burden in their situation.\nSo, he had to make money.\nThe more he grew, the more money he could make.\nFor example, by hunting monsters that appeared nearby.\nHe could sell usable parts or non-evaporating items from the monster corpses and make some money.\nHe realized later that it was a form of smuggling.\nSelling unverified items.\nIn some cities, no one cared.\nBut here, things were different.\nMonster hunts only happened in specific areas.\nIt seemed even the city had taken an interest.\nWhen he arrived at areas where monster appearances had been detected or reported, the monsters were already dead.\nAnd this kept happening for a while.\nSo, the conclusion was clear.\nA rather strong Awakened was secretly active in the area.\n\"It’s not a group but an individual. Impressive for someone so young.\"\nTwo professors from the academy and one Awakened from the outside.\nIn total, three people had tracked down Han Si-Hoo.\nThere may have been more watching from the shadows.\n\"So you live in the slums? You must have a residence nearby. We can’t let talent like this go to waste.\"\n\"Oh, by the way, we’re professors. How about joining the academy?\"\nThe offer for admission came immediately.\n\"...Weren’t you planning to arrest me?\"\n\"You’re not confirmed to be a villain. There have been some troubling incidents nearby, sure.\"\n\"That’s true.\"\n\"Anyway, student. Well, you’re not a student yet, but how about joining the academy? It’s a great opportunity to grow as an Awakened under the purpose of protecting humanity.\"\nHan Si-Hoo felt uneasy the moment they mentioned arrest.\nIt was clear this wasn’t something he could refuse easily.\n\"Ah, do you have family? If so, we have protective facilities.\"\nProtection?\nThere was no way he could trust that.\nHe had never seen any decent place among those called protective facilities.\nSeo-Ah was safer outside.\nThese people were suspicious.\nThey were stronger Awakened than Han Si-Hoo.\nHe had to be extra careful.\n\"So, you’ve been living alone? You’re not part of any hunting group, right?\"\nHe had no choice but to answer that way.\n\"Long-term unregistered Awakened are subject to penalties, but since you’re young, you... should be fine.\"\nThus, his academy tour was forced.\nIf he had said no, he would have been arrested or dealt with.\nHe narrowly avoided being mistaken for a villain operating near the city.\nThe cost was entering the academy.\nIt was practically forced.\n\"So you were living outside? Don’t worry, the academy provides dorms.\"\nHe followed his instincts.\nSeo-Ah’s existence must not be discovered.\nThese people were monsters.\nBehind their kindness, there was malice.\nHad Han Si-Hoo shown even a hint of reluctance, he might have never been able to return to Seo-Ah.\nThe academy tour was completed somehow.\nHe returned home.\nIt had taken two full days.\nHe had completed registration as an official Awakened and went through the temporary admission process.\nOnly then was he able to leave the academy.\nTwo days was a long time.\nHe hadn’t been able to tell Seo-Ah anything before disappearing.\nBut somehow, he made it back.\n\"Where have you been?\"\nSeo-Ah was waiting in front of Han Si-Hoo’s house.\nThey lived near each other, but Seo-Ah’s house and Si-Hoo’s house were separate.\nHaving one house per person felt like living quite well.\nIt was close to a game of house.\n\"...Something came up.\"\n\"Where did you go?\"\nDisappearing without a word for two days was the problem.\nWhat should he say?\nI was dragged away?\nHan Si-Hoo couldn’t find the right words.\n\"The academy.\"\n\"The academy...?\"\n\"Yeah. It looks like I’ll be attending the academy.\"\nIt was almost forced.\nBut he didn’t want Seo-Ah to worry.\nHe pretended it was his decision.\n\"Why?\"\n\"It’ll be better. I can make a lot of money.\"\n\"Why didn’t you tell me?\"\n\"Sorry. It was decided suddenly.\"\n\"What are you talking about...\"\nSeo-Ah spoke in confusion.\nOf course, she wouldn’t understand.\nBut if he didn’t attend the academy... running away was the only option.\nEven taking Seo-Ah with him to another region seemed impossible, and the academy had already set up measures to prevent Han Si-Hoo from fleeing.\nThe moment he signed the admission contract was the problem.\nThere was now minimal surveillance on him.\nIf he tried to escape and got caught, a child without guardians in the slums would be sent to a facility.\nAnd if he was mistaken for a villain, it would be even worse.\n\"Don’t go.\"\n\"We don’t have much money.\"\n\"I-I’ll make money!\"\n\"It’s better if I go. I’ll still come here often, so don’t worry.\"\nHe had no choice but to go.\nEven if the academy couldn’t be trusted, there might be ways to take advantage of it.\nFrom what he had learned during the tour, the amount of money given to students was enormous.They were in need of money, after all.\n\"......\"\nBy this point, Seo-Ah was already addicted to the drugs.\nThe cost of the drugs was rising.\n\"I’m sorry. I came back late without saying anything. The academy sent someone, and I went to meet them.\"\nWhat would Seo-Ah’s reaction be if he told her he was practically forced into the academy?\nHan Si-Hoo believed it was better to handle it on his own.\nHe thought he could use the academy to his advantage.\nIn hindsight, it was around this time that Seo-Ah started wearing long sleeves.\nShe often held her arms behind her back, probably to hide the scars.\n\"S-So, when do you leave for the academy?\"\n\"Next week.\"\n\"I see.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nHis head was spinning, thinking about how to handle the academy.\nHe thought, somehow. Somehow, it would work out.\nThat was his mindset.\n\"Well, if you’ve decided to go, I can’t stop you. Good luck.\"\nSeo-Ah spoke as if she had resigned herself to the situation, as if it didn’t matter.\nThere was no sign of anxiety.\n\"If someone from the academy came to get you, you must be really special.\"\nShe said with a smile.\n\"I’ll still come here often. I might not stay at the academy for long. I could quit soon.\"\nThat’s what he thought.\nAt least until he realized how big the rewards were from the academy.\n\"I see.\"\nThere was no problem for Seo-Ah.\nAnd the academy provided huge rewards.\nSo there was no reason to quit.\n\"I’m sorry.\"\nBut if Seo-Ah hated him being at the academy, he would have to find a solution.\nThat’s what he thought.\nOne week after transferring to the academy.\nHan Si-Hoo received more money than he had ever held in his life.\nIt was given under the name of activity funds.\nWith this, there would be no more issues with living expenses or paying for the drugs.\nIf he saved up, they could even move to a better place.\nAt sunset, he took some time to visit Seo-Ah’s house.\nHe gave her all the money he had received.\nSeo-Ah didn’t seem as interested in the money as he expected.\nAfter hesitating for a moment, Seo-Ah spoke.\n\"Si-Hoo, do you want to go look at the stars tonight?\"\nIt wasn’t the question he had expected.\nIt wasn’t about money or the academy.\nIt was just a simple suggestion to go stargazing.\n\"Can’t you?\"\nHe had a promise.\nA promise with the academy.\nIf he didn’t want to attract attention, he had to return quickly.\n\"...Sorry. I have plans tonight.\"\n\"With who?\"\nIt was a promise with the academy.\nHe had to go back.\n\"Oh, a friend.\"\nIt was a meaningless excuse.\nHe just didn’t want to tell her the truth, though it seemed strange not to.\n\"Ah, so you had plans tonight, with a friend...\"\nShe tried not to show her disappointment, acting like it didn’t matter.\n\"I was just saying. Don’t worry about it.\"\nAt the time, Han Si-Hoo thought Seo-Ah would be fine.\nThere was still plenty of time, and even if she seemed a little disappointed, he could make it up to her later.\nAfter all, he had earned a lot of money, so it wasn’t all bad.\n\"I’m glad to hear you’re doing well at the academy.\"\nBut this was the last chance to maintain his relationship with Seo-Ah.\nHe shouldn’t have gone back to the academy.\nWhat if he had gone to look at the stars with her that night?\nMaybe Seo-Ah had wanted to talk about the drugs.\nMaybe she would have asked for help, saying something felt wrong.\nEven if Seo-Ah hadn’t said anything, maybe Han Si-Hoo would have noticed something was off.\nBut he didn’t realize.\nPerhaps he was trying to convince himself there was no problem.\nHe told Seo-Ah he would come back again later.\nThere would be another chance, after all.\n\"Goodbye...\"\nAnd with that, Han Si-Hoo left.\nNow there was no one left to talk to.\nIf you think about it, this was the point of no return.\nThey had crossed the river of no recovery.\n\"Sorry.\"\nHe apologized, but no one could hear him.\nEven starting from the slums, he believed they could climb higher.\nThough there were many people not to be trusted, there were still heroes worth respecting.\nBut there were too many pieces of trash.\nEven so, Han Si-Hoo believed he was different from that trash.\nBut now, he wasn’t sure what made him different.\nWhat was he trying to do?\nKidnap Lee Yoo-Ram’s younger sister?\nTake her hostage and threaten her?\n\"Sorry.\"\nHe was just like the others.\nLee Yoo-Ram was just trying to protect her own family.\nSeo-Ah had her own desires.\nThough she failed as a teacher, it was hard to say her younger sister was guilty too.\nHow was this any different from what the doctor had done?\nEven so, he wanted to kill the doctor.\nAt least hear the reason why.\nAnd then kill him in the most painful way possible.\nBut there was no need to extend that suffering to others.\nThat wouldn’t be right.\nNo, he would still be willing to bear that if it meant he could kill the doctor.\nHe wanted to deal with him.\nHe hated the idea of that person existing in his memories.\nHe wanted him gone from his life for good.\nMore than that, though...\nHe just wanted to go home.\nHe should have gone stargazing with her.\nHan Si-Hoo stood there, on the street.\nA street with no one walking by.\nNo cars, no people.\nThe streetlights shone lonely in the night.\nIn truth, Han Si-Hoo had no friends.\nThe time he spent with the kids at the academy was nothing compared to the time he spent with Seo-Ah.\nIt was a sudden realization.\nHan Si-Hoo had no friends to share old memories with.\nHe was alone.",

      "content": "The phenomenon of awakening can be found in most living creatures.\nHowever, when it manifests in non-human beings, they are generally called monsters.\nThat was the content of the presentation.\n“This too is a type of science. The reason we call it magic is simply because we haven’t yet identified its underlying principles,” said the presenter, opening his mouth again.\nAbout fifteen people were watching from the front.\n“Actually, even modern science, when delved into deeply enough, inevitably reaches a point where we hit unknowns. There’s a world out there that we simply don’t understand.”\nWhy am I here?\nI feel like it’s been a long time.\nMy mind kept slipping in and out of consciousness.\nMy bangs slightly covered my eyes.\nI hadn’t cut my hair carelessly enough for it to get this long, but it was now long enough to poke at my eyes.\nTime must have passed along with my growing hair.\n“Anyway, several opinions have emerged on how we should view this awakening phenomenon.”\nA presentation about awakenings?\nI don’t understand why I’m here.\nI wasn’t sitting on a chair. I was standing.\nI didn’t feel like I was part of this gathering.\nI wasn’t sitting like the others, just standing, as if I were waiting for my turn to present.\nWhat turn?\nWhat was I waiting for?\n“The appearance of gates and dungeons often affects nearby creatures, producing so-called monsters or awakened creatures. There are even those presumed to have come from another dimension,” the presenter continued.\nSo they say.\n“Then, what exactly are human Awakened? Should they still be regarded as ordinary humanity?”\nOf course Awakened are human.\nWhat else would they be?\n“Should we simply understand this as a case of unlocking latent human potential, or should we consider Awakened to be fundamentally different from ordinary humans?”\nDifferent from regular humans, they say.\nIt’s true; they are different.\n“Seeing that only some individuals awaken even in the same environment, it’s been concluded that this awakening phenomenon only happens to a select few.”\nThat’s obvious.\nIf it were the environment alone, Seo-Ah would’ve become an Awakened like Si-Hoo.\n“The rate of meaningful awakenings is incredibly low. Clearly, Awakened are distinctly different from the rest of humanity…”\nThey keep talking about humanity.\n“The conclusion is that ordinary human rights do not apply to them…”\nNo human rights?\nDid I hear that right?\n“To preserve and promote humanity’s survival, Awakened beings will be treated on the same level as other monsters. However, considering they were once human, certain guidelines have been established…”\nIt sounds like they’re saying something terrifying.\n“First, they lack human reasoning and judgment.”\nI can feel the stares directed at me.\n“Second, if they cannot live independently and must rely on others.”\nI tried to speak, but I couldn’t.\n“They will be understood in the same way as regular monsters.”\nMove.\nDo something.\nBut my body refuses.\n“The state fully permits the breeding and experimentation of humanoid monsters for the sake of public safety, and grants full authority over these experiments to…”\nThe sound of applause.\nIt seemed the presentation had concluded.\n“That’s all. Then…”\nWhat comes next?\n“Before we move on to the next item,” said the person seated in the center.\nThe lights were all focused on the podium, blinding me.I couldn’t make out who it was.\n“What is that thing standing next to us?”\nHe was pointing at me.\nWhy am I here?\nI don’t know.\n“That is an Awakened being.”\n“Was it bred for this purpose?”\n“No, it was brought here for the next demonstration.”\nI’m not used to all this attention.\nBut I show no reaction.\nNo change in expression.\nI remain still.\nWaiting.\n“Very well, let’s proceed to the next item.”\n“The next item is about controlling Awakened beings. When we use the [Command Words] system we’ve developed, we can fully control any Awakened being that understands human speech.”\n“Don’t Command Words require pre-treatment with drugs?”\n“It is troublesome when they don’t understand what’s being said.”\nAh, commands.\nIf I’m given an order under the influence of the drug, I must obey.\nSo that’s what they call Command Words.\n“Physical devices like shock collars have shown some effectiveness, but ultimately, devices that directly interfere with the nervous system proved to be the most efficient.”\nThey’re saying some terrifying things.\nAre they discussing this so casually?\n“How did you test this?”\n“Well, we collected brainwave data, and any time the subject showed signs of aggression, we inflicted pain to deter them…”\n“No, I mean where did you release the test subjects?”\n“Monsters, you mean. We released them near the academy, partly to assess the students’ abilities.”\nThe academy.\nOh, the place where students fight.\nYes.\nI remember now.\n“You released them near my property? If you’re going to do that, at least consult with me first.”\n“Well… the government authorized it, so…”\n“Are you going to keep babbling nonsense?”\n“Ah, anyway. The result is that the control devices work as intended. If you look here…”\nThe white screen showing the projector’s presentation rolled up, revealing something hidden behind it.\nGasping sounds could be heard throughout the room.\n“A wolf?”\nBehind the screen stood a wolf-like monster.\nIt did nothing, just sitting still without baring its teeth.\n“A wolf? That’s unusual, seeing one so docile.”\nIt wasn’t dead.\nIt was breathing.\nBut it didn’t attack.\n“Yes, like this. I can control it with this remote. Let me demonstrate.”\n-Grrrr.\nThe wolf bared its teeth.\n“Attack.”\nThe wolf charged.\nAt whom?\nAt me.\nWhy me?\nThere are so many others.\nIt lunged, sinking its fangs into my shoulder.\nThud.\nThe weight of the wolf brought me crashing to the ground.\nCrunch.\nSnap.\nCrack.\nThe sounds were ominous.\n“Stop.”\nThe wolf stopped instantly and backed away.\n“As you can see, we can control them without the use of Command Words.”\nIt didn’t hurt.\nLuckily, it didn’t hurt.\nI think I’m bleeding, but it doesn’t hurt.\nIs that fortunate?\n“The safety is guaranteed. The issue is that it doesn’t work on beings with no brain-like structures, those that are too large or small, or monsters immune to pain.”\n“And?”\n“We’ll let you know once it’s ready for military supply. We’re not yet at mass production, and the procedures are complex.”\n“When it comes to control, the key is ensuring the monster’s original abilities remain intact. Can we say that this wolf still has its natural strength while following commands?”\nThe wolf’s strength was undeniable.\nI know because I experienced it.\nBut I think I’m bleeding a lot.\nCan someone stop the bleeding?\nI feel as heavy as if I have a boulder in my body.\nI can’t move.\n“Well, since we suppress their natural aggression, their strength might be slightly reduced. There’s still room for improvement.”\n“It sounds like it’s broken. Beating it into submission isn’t much different. Even the one behind me behaves after I gave it a few beatings.”\nFrom my position on the floor, I could see the large figure behind the speaker.\nI hadn’t noticed it while standing.\nIs that a monster too?\nIt’s hard to see against the light.\n“The day we perfect this technology isn’t far off. With the involvement of major corporations, advancing magical technology would be impossible without the government’s cooperation.”\n“Let’s move on to the next item.”\nI wish someone would pay attention to me.\n“Yes, the next item is the disposal of the captured dragon.”\nA dragon?\nThere are dragons in this world?\nOh, right.\nI’ve seen it on the news.\nThe Awakened killed a dragon.\n“We captured it, harvested all the items, but keeping it imprisoned has become complicated. It continues to grow stronger just by existing…”\nA dragon grows even when it’s still?\nThat’s an absurd ability.\n“If you release it near the academy again, I’ll drop the property prices there. I’m warning you.”\n“That won’t happen. We’ve found a special use for the dragon.”\nThe person seated in front spoke.\n“Explain.”\n“Look at this Awakened being, lying on the floor.”\nThey’re looking at me again.\nAre they going to help me?\nTreatment?\nNo, their stares are not compassionate.\n“Ah, you can’t see clearly. Well then, [Stand].”\nThe Command Word.\nI stagger as I try to get up.\nBut I can’t stand.\nBlood drips from my clothes.\nWhy am I here?\nFor what purpose?\nI can’t stand.\nI feel my hair has grown longer.\nMy hair, which used to be short, now reaches past my shoulders.\nBlood has stained it as well.\n“As expected, it can’t stand. But even in such emergencies, we now have a solution.”\nThud.\nA needle pierced the back of my neck.\nIt’s a familiar sensation.\n“If something like this happens, nearby healers can use their skills to help. But such people are rare, and that’s the issue.”\nThe speaker continued.\n“That’s why even when we manage Awakened beings, there are always limitations.”\nHot liquid flowed through my veins.\n“Of course, a good recovery potion could heal wounds of this severity. However, it’s very expensive and in short supply.”\nI can feel the bleeding stopping.\nEven the bones that seemed broken are mending.\n“The recovery seems complete. Now, [Stand].”\nI followed the order to stand.\nI didn’t want to, but I had no choice.\nI got up and returned to the waiting position.\nStanding there with no change in expression.\n“While this drug is expensive, the amount we obtain from killing a single dragon is enough to supply the academy for a while.”\n“You’ll supply the academy first?”\n“Yes. Since the military operates collectively, we prioritized the academy where individual survival is crucial.”\n“The syringe seems inconvenient.”\n“This version is for immediate effect. We can also produce pill or potion forms for general use.”\nThe academy.\nSo they’re planning to supply this drug to the academy.\nIt seems useful.\nBut did they really have to demonstrate it this way?\nLogically, no one would ever do such a thing.\nDid they really need to set up someone in front just to attack?\nOh.\nMaybe I’m not someone.\nI don’t know anymore.\nThe wolf, its mouth stained with blood, stood still.\nI too was covered in blood.\nIt didn’t matter either way.\nWe both had no choice but to stand there.\nI had to follow the commands.\nI felt a strange kinship with the wolf.\nMy heart pounded.\nWas it because of the drug?\nDizziness set in.\nA piercing ringing in my ears.\nI couldn’t make out what anyone was saying.\n[405 hours 22 minutes]\nTime.\nWhat did that time mean?\nDid it just increase?\nI think it did.\n“…Heh.”\nI chuckled softly.\nI felt pretty good.\nNot scared at all.\nI guess it’s thanks to the drug.",

      "content": "In reality, everything depends on your mindset.\nWhoever said that, they weren’t wrong.\nYou can't change what happens outside.\nNo matter what kind of chaotic things happen, no matter how bad the situation gets, if you can keep your mind steady on the inside, everything will be fine.\nEven people who appear miserable on the outside may actually be living a happy life.\nThere’s no guarantee that someone living in a fancy house, eating delicious food, and sleeping in a comfortable bed is happier than someone living in the slums.\nEven if, like now, you’re trapped in something like a prison.\nI’m fine because I’m happy.\n“You came again.”\nIt’s the nameless male researcher.\nHe looks like he’s in his 30s.\nSometimes, he comes and talks to me.\nEven when I don’t respond, he keeps talking.\n“Here, a snack. I sneaked it in again.”\nIt’s milk and bread.\nI accept it gratefully.\n“There’s no one here who listens to me except you.”\nThe bread is delicious.\nThe red bean filling inside is tasty.\nIf someone gives you food, they must be a good person.\nIs that so?\nI think my thoughts are becoming very one-dimensional.\nI guess my intelligence has declined.\nI used to be smarter, didn’t I?\nAnyway, the bread was good, and the researcher’s rant didn’t last long.\n“Should I cut your bangs again, like last time?”\nMy bangs are a bit long.\nI used to have short hair.\n“They don’t allow us to bring scissors in here without permission... I’ll try to bring some next time.”\nThis hairstyle isn’t bad.\nHonestly, I don’t care.\n“Oh. Give me the trash.”\nHe collects the empty milk carton and the plastic that held the bread.\nSince he sneaked it in, leaving the trash behind would be a problem.\nI wonder if this researcher is a bit lacking in the head.\nThere are definitely surveillance devices in this room.\nEveryone can see everything, everywhere.\nThat’s how it must be.\nThat’s why I can’t do anything.\nI don’t know if there’s a listening device on the researcher’s collar or if there’s a camera filming me.\nActually, the kindness itself might be an act.\nEveryone here is strange.\nBut still, the snack was good, so it’s fine.\n[384 hours 7 minutes]\nThere’s a lot of time.\nIt’s probably the amount of time I still have to stay here.\nI can instinctively feel that my intelligence has deteriorated because of this.\n“Well, I’m going now. I have work tomorrow... I can come back the day after.”\nIt doesn’t matter either way.\nHe leaves through the door.\nI’m left alone in the white prison.\n[384 hours]\n7 minutes passed.\n[383 hours]\nAn hour passed.\nWhite walls.\nA closed door.\n[382 hours]\nAnother hour passed.\nWhirring.\nThe sound of the generator stops.\nAfter a bit more time, the lights turn off.\nIt’s time to sleep.\nI close my eyes.\nI open my eyes.\n[371 hours 23 minutes]\n10 hours are gone.\nI slept a lot.\n“Come out.”\nSomeone is here.\nI follow them out.\n[522 hours 27 minutes]\nWow, the time has increased.\nWhat did I do this time?\nI’m lying back in my room, and I feel strange.\nBut it’s a good strange.\nThere’s a faint sense of pleasure.\nWhat was it again?\nSomething about a pressure test with some weird machine.\nIt didn’t seem like a machine meant for humans.\nI was the only human there—everyone else was either an animal or a monster.\nI have a suspicion.\nI might be the only person imprisoned here.\nThis prison is like a zoo, filled with monsters.\nI think the researcher mentioned that to me once.\n“Oh.”\nIt’s the researcher who brings me snacks.\n“Are you okay?”\nI’m very okay.\nIn fact, I’m happy.\nI’m joyful.\n“Heh...”\nI try smiling.\nI heard it’s good to smile once in a while.\nThe researcher lifts me up and puts me on the bed.\nThe floor isn’t bad, but the bed is definitely softer.\n“You can’t eat the snack, can you?”\nI can eat the snack.\nOr can I?\nMy body doesn’t move well.\nThe recovery drug helped a bit, but not completely.\nWell, after being thrown into this room, I couldn’t move.\nThe floor was warm enough, though, so it wasn’t bad.\n“Sorry. I’m powerless too. I can only come into this room under the pretense of cleaning.”\nI’m not even sure if he’s really a researcher.\nMaybe he’s just a janitor?\nNo, probably just a low-level employee.\nI assumed that everyone working here was a researcher.\nBut I’ll call this nice guy something different.\nResearcher A.\nIf another kind person shows up, I’ll call them Researcher B.\n“I don’t get this place. I don’t...”\nHe looks troubled.\nHe’s holding the bread he was going to give me.\n“I’ll give you the snack next time.”\n[522 hours 20 minutes]\nTime passes.\nIn the blink of an eye.\n[504 hours 14 minutes]\nAt some point, Researcher A had disappeared.\nIt feels like he said something to me, but I didn’t hear it.\nMy mind was elsewhere.\nBut now my body is moving again.\nOr maybe it was always moving, and I just regained awareness now.\nHonestly, it’s amazing that I’m still alive.\nIn any case, I feel good, so it’s all fine.\nI feel good.\nI always feel good.\nIt’s like my brain has melted.\nOr maybe it’s rotted away.\nAnyway, it’s good that my body is moving.\nI get off the bed.\nThud.\nI got down.\nOr maybe it’s better to say I fell.\nMy legs have no strength.\nEven though I used the recovery drug.\nIt’s strange that I’m still not recovering.\nSomething feels wrong.\nAh.\nI don’t know.\nEvery day passes the same way.\nThere’s no potential for growth, no possibilities.\nSurvival, that’s what this is.\nLiving by crawling at the bottom.\nBut even that doesn’t feel bad.\nIn fact, it’s all good.\nNone of it matters.\nIf my legs don’t work, I’ll just use more drugs.\nThat should fix it.\nAs long as I keep recovering, I’ll stay alive.They said the drug was made from dragon’s blood or something.\nIt’s a new drug still in development.\nSo maybe some batches are less effective.\nBut I still feel good.\nMaybe eating will make me feel better.\nThere’s a button on the wall.\nWhen I press it, food falls to the floor.\nIt’s mostly chocolate bar-like things.\nIt’s like that.\nLike those machines that automatically dispense food for dogs and cats.\nYou press the button, and the food comes out.\nThunk.\nSomething like an unwrapped energy bar drops out.\nI crawl over and pick it up with my hands.\nPathetic.\nBut it has a unique taste.\nLike pet food?\nNo, it’s the taste of pleasure.\n[505 hours 54 minutes]\nWhile eating, time keeps increasing.\nThere must be drugs mixed into the food too.\nIt looks like a simple snack on the outside.\nBut there’s something pleasant inside.\nIf I press the button again, nothing comes out.\nI have to wait.\nThat makes sense.\nIf it kept dispensing, I’d overeat.\nI managed to pick up what was on the floor.\nThe button is mounted low on the wall, so I can reach it.\nBut standing is difficult.\nSomeone must be watching.\nRight?\nThere must be surveillance cameras installed.\nSo, they must be watching.\nThen help me out a bit.\n[505 hours]\nThe floor is all I see.\nI can see the dust settling.\n[500 hours]\n5 hours gone.\nNothing has changed.\nI’m still staring at the white floor.\nWhy aren’t they coming to help?\nThinking back, it was the same when the wolf attacked me.\nThey had no intention of saving me.\nHonestly, I don’t need the help.\nI’m just bored, so I’m doing this.\nStaring at the same thing all the time makes me feel strange.\nAm I worthless?\nNot even worth monitoring?\nNo matter how I look at it, I’m just a disposable tool.\nUseful if I’m around, but no one cares if I’m not.\nBut it’d be nice if they kept giving me the drugs.\n[499 hours 59 minutes]\nClunk.\nThe door opened.\nA researcher?\n“Come out.”\nAnother experiment.\nBut, well, the drugs always make me feel better, so that’s good.\nThe problem is that my body won’t move.\nMy arms and legs twitch slightly, but that’s it.\n“Can’t move?”\nIf it were Researcher A, he’d have brought me a snack.\n“[Come out.]”\nI should go out.\nBut I can’t.\nAn impossible command can’t be followed.\nThere’s nothing I can do about that.\n“They injected the drug.”\nHe mutters something.\nDo all researchers like talking to themselves?\n“Well. It’s been a long time.”\nI have been stuck here for a while.\nDoes that mean I can go outside now?\nBut I’m not sure if that’s a good thing.\nMore importantly, why am I here?\nI’ve asked that question hundreds of times, but I don’t have an answer.\nMy memories are all tangled up, and my intelligence is declining.\nAt least I’m happy, so that’s something.\nThe researcher pulls out his phone and makes a call.\n“Yes, yes…”\nWhat’s the conversation about?\nI can’t really hear.\n“Ah, it won’t move, even with the Command Words.”\nJust drag me out.\nWhy should I walk?\nYou always tell me to just stand still.\nIs not standing really that big of a problem?\n“Should I dispose of it?”\nWhat?\nDispose?\n“That’s what they said. It’s strange it’s still alive…”\nWhat are they talking about?\nWhy are they talking about disposal while looking at me?\n“Well, if that’s the order… Thank you. Take care.”\nThe researcher hangs up the phone.\nHe messes up his hair, looking frustrated.\n“What am I supposed to do with this?”\nYeah.\nWhat are you going to do?\n“Do I just throw it into the incinerator?”\nIncinerator?\nAre they going to burn me?\nI don’t want to die.\nI don’t want to die.\n“If I follow the manual, I just have to kill it and toss it in.”\nWhat kind of manual is that?\n“I don’t want to do it myself.”\nHe grumbles.\n“Why does it have to look like a person...”\nI\nam\na person.\nNot just something that looks like one.\nWell, I look like one, but still.\nI\nam\na person.\n“Guess I have no choice.”\nHe starts dragging me out of the room.\nThe white hallway.\nLast time, there were bloodstains left where I’d been dragged.\nThis time, the hallway is clean.\nSomeone must’ve cleaned it.\nI can see that someone wiped the floor.\nIt was probably Researcher A.\n[499 hours 58 minutes]\nMy body won’t move at all.\nIt feels like things got worse after eating the food.\nMaybe there was an ingredient that didn’t agree with me.\nOr it’s because of the last experiment.\n“What are you doing?”\nIt’s Researcher A’s voice.\n“Oh, they said to dispose of it? It won’t move.”\nThe other researcher lets go of my neck.\n“Dispose?”\n“Yeah, it’s lucky you’re here. You do it. Just kill it and toss it in the incinerator, and it’s done.”\n“What are you talking about…”\n“You’ve dealt with monster disposal before. You can handle it. They said it’s strange that it’s still alive.”\nThat “it” refers to me.\nResearcher A looks at me.\nI can see the snack sticking out of his pocket.\nHe probably brought it for me.\nThanks, but I can’t eat it.\n“…Yes. Understood.”\n“Good. Thanks.”\nThe other researcher leaves quickly, looking relieved to have passed the task off.\nOnce the other researcher disappears from sight, the hallway falls silent.\nAll I can hear is breathing.\nThere are no words.\nAs if coming to his senses, Researcher A speaks.\n“...Dispose?”\nHis trembling voice breaks the silence.\nI want to say something too.\nBut my mouth won’t move.\n“Incinerate?”\nI can see the snack wrapper sticking out of Researcher A’s pocket.",

      "content": "\"Hah... Haha. These insane people. If I hadn’t come, they would have really killed the child...\"\nThe researcher muttered to himself, barely regaining his composure as he turned his gaze to the test subject.\n\"Are you alright? You’re still alive, right?\"\nHe already knew there wouldn’t be a reply. Honestly, he wasn’t even sure if this test subject was human. However, by all appearances, she was just a young girl.\nShe was still breathing, though her breathing was unsteady, and she was burning up with a fever.\n\"They said she was for disposal. Incinerator...\"\nThe researcher searched for a solution. Others treated this test subject as if she were merely a human-shaped monster. Perhaps they were right. She had shown an astonishing level of resilience.\nHe didn’t know the exact details of the experiments being conducted. But judging from the condition of the other test subjects, he could make a guess. Ethics didn’t exist here.\nThis place was full of monsters, creatures he didn’t know how they had even been procured. Whatever methods they had used, all of them had been subdued into docility. They obeyed orders well.\nOnce experiments began, none of them ever came back intact. Most never returned at all. Their shredded corpses were simply incinerated.\nBut somehow, this girl in his arms had survived. He didn’t know if it was because the intensity of the experiments was lower or if it was a different kind of experiment altogether. What was clear, however, was that she had reached her limit.\n\"Damn it.\"\nOf course, no one would object if he threw her into the incinerator. In fact, the problem was that no one cared. It was a world gone mad.\nShe was considered something vaguely human, a type of monster. But he was starting to question what it even meant to be truly human anymore.\nCarrying the test subject, he headed toward the incinerator. But then he hesitated.\nIn truth, incineration was the right choice. He was just doing his job. There was no need to kill her first; he could just throw her in alive.\n\"They always bag the trash separately...\"\nOf course, he had no intention of burning her. He wouldn’t kill her. Keeping her alive was the right thing to do.\nHe had been powerless before, unable to do anything. Giving her snacks had been the limit of what he could do. But maybe this time, he had a real chance. Perhaps he could get her out of here.\n\"Maybe I’ll disguise her as trash to smuggle her out.\"\nHe decided to drive the garbage truck out. Once they were outside the facility, he could figure something out. Surely, that would work.\nBut what would he do once they got outside? Should he take her to a hospital? Would a hospital even treat something that wasn’t human? He couldn’t form a clear plan. Outwardly, she looked like a person.\nThe researcher still didn’t know what this girl was. She had no name, no identity.\n\"Sigh...\"\nSometimes he thought, maybe this girl wasn’t a monster at all. Maybe she was just a human who defied common sense, like the many other awakened humans that existed. Could she be one of them?\nBut no, that couldn’t be the case. They couldn’t be part of an organization that did such things. Surely she wasn’t human. They locked her up because they believed she wasn’t.\nThere was plenty of evidence to suggest she was a monster. It was even possible to prove it.\n-Don’t be fooled by appearances. There are monsters that can change shape. Are you going to pity all of them just because they look human? This is no different.\nShe was just a monster. She should be killed, but she was kept alive because she was of use to humanity.\n-If you don’t want to do it, then don’t. You can handle all the cleaning yourself if you want. Is that what you want? Do whatever you like.\nAnd so, he had essentially become a cleaner. He couldn’t bring himself to participate in unethical experiments. In reality, he was running away. Yet, the salary kept him tied to the facility.\nOccasionally, bringing snacks to the girl felt like a necessary act. He had thought about exposing the facility’s corruption or freeing the girl someday.\nBut he never imagined that day would be today.\n\"No, if I’m going to escape, why go to the incinerator at all... Wouldn’t disguising her as trash be more of a hassle?\"\nHe sorted out his thoughts. He needed to come up with a plan quickly. It wouldn’t be hard to hide a girl who didn’t look like a terrifying monster.\nJust go now. Running away seemed like the best option.\nStairs? The elevator would be faster.\nB5. The elevator marked \"B5\" appeared.\nThe incinerator wasn’t in this direction. But this was the quickest way out.\nDing.\nThe elevator doors opened. The first floor. He needed to get to the first floor. He gently placed the girl on the elevator floor and pressed the button.\nThe elevator started to rise.\nB5. The lower floors were rarely used. It was where they stored large monsters, but transporting those monsters was an ordeal in itself.\nB4. This floor contained smaller, but more numerous monsters.\nB3. Monsters that were easier to catch and more common were stored here.\nB2. Monsters ready to be used in experiments were kept here.\nB1. From here on, it wasn’t a storage area for monsters anymore.\nThe elevator whirred to a halt.\nDing.\nThe doors opened with a chime. No one was supposed to be here. But someone was.\nAcross from him stood a familiar figure.\n\"The director?\"\nIt was the research director. He wasn’t supposed to be here at this hour. It was late evening, and most of the staff had already gone home.\nBehind the director stood five members of the containment team. They were dressed in protective suits reminiscent of space suits, each holding a baton crackling with electricity.\nSomething was wrong.\n\"So... where exactly are you taking that? Didn’t I tell you it was scheduled for disposal?\"\n\"Oh, yes. I was on my way to the incinerator.\"\n\"Right. The incinerator is in the opposite direction.\"\n\"I must’ve taken a wrong turn...\"\nThe director laughed.\n\"Haha. A wrong turn, you say? We’ve been watching you.\"\nThe cameras. Of course. He hadn’t expected the director and the containment team to respond so quickly.\n\"I knew this would happen. How many times have I told you? A monster is just a monster.\"\n\"But—\"\n\"I gave you so many chances because I thought you were talented. But if you keep this up, you won’t even be fit to handle the cleaning. You’re trying to smuggle a monster out.\"\n\"It’s a misunderstanding.\"\n\"Put it down, and we’ll talk.\"\nThe researcher carefully set the girl down. Though she couldn’t move, she seemed to be conscious.\n\"Take her.\"\n\"Wait...!\"\nThe containment team immediately grabbed the girl and dragged her in front of the director.\n\"Where did I leave that golf club? Bring it over.\"\nWhat was he planning to do?\n\"This is just a monster. Didn’t I show you the mana detection chart? She’s not human. Stop letting appearances fool you.\"\n\"I understand. I’ll take care of it myself. There’s no need for you to get involved.\"\nIf he left her in their hands, it was over. There would be no rescue, no escape.\n\"Oh, right. Here’s the club. Go ahead.\"\nThe director handed the researcher a golf club.\n\"Hit her.\"\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\"You said you’d take care of it.\"\n\"What are you talking about?\"\nThud.\nThe director kicked the test subject toward the researcher.\n\"Does this look like a person to you?\"\nShe didn’t even seem to feel pain. Maybe she really wasn’t in pain. So does that mean anything could be done to her?\n\"Haha, this thing?\"\nShe looked human. Ironically, it was the director who seemed inhuman.\n\"Swing it. Hard.\"\nHe was telling him to beat her to death.\n\"...\"\nThe containment team stood menacingly. Refusing would have consequences. After all, she was just a test subject. A monster.\nHe could do it.\nBut he knew he shouldn’t. He knew better than anyone that he shouldn’t.\nThe girl looked up at the researcher. He still hadn’t had the chance to cut her bangs. He hadn’t even given her a snack.\nIf he made the wrong choice now, it would haunt him for the rest of his life. He would regret it forever. That would be no different from being dead.\n\"...I can’t do it.\"\nHe couldn’t say anything else.\n\"Well, if that’s how it is. Hand over the club and leave.\"\nThe researcher took the club from him.\n\"Even so, I’ll handle this test subject, so please trust me just this once...\"\nWhoosh.\nThe director raised the golf club. He intended to do it himself.\nStop him. How?\nThwack.\nIt wasn’t the test subject that was hit—it was the researcher. There was no way to stop it. He had tried to throw himself in the way, but...\n\"...There’s no other choice.\"\nThud.\nA simple kick. The containment team could subdue any monster with just that much force. But the one who had been kicked was a person.\nThump.\nThe researcher was sent flying all the way to the elevator entrance.\n\"It’s a shame to waste such talent... Well, you can just stay in there for now.\"\nThe containment team opened the elevator door and shoved the researcher inside. The doors closed.\n\"And... what’s this?\"\nOn the floor lay bread and milk. The containment team must have kicked it over. It was the snack he had brought for the girl.\n\"Snacks? Were you planning to give this to the test subject?\"\nHe had grown attached to the test subject, it seemed. Why bother with something so pointless?\nCrunch.\nThe director crushed the bread underfoot.\n\"Get rid of it.\"\nBut no one responded. The only sound was an odd squelch.\n\"What’s with all of you...?\"\nHe turned to see the reason. The containment team stood frozen in place, large black spikes piercing through their heads. One by one, their electric batons slipped from their hands and clattered to the ground.\nThey were dead. Quietly, quickly.\n\"What the...?\"\nHe couldn’t believe his eyes, but it was reality. They had been silently impaled.\nStanding behind them was the test subject.\n\"Wait, what? How...?\"\nThere was no waiting. It was already over.\nThud. He couldn’t even scream.\nThe director froze in place as if suspended in midair.\n\"Aha.\"\nThe test subject smiled.\nSquelch. Crack. Thwack.\nSticky blood oozed out. The sound was terrifying.\nWooooo-oooo.\nThe wail of the facility’s alarm echoed. The facility would automatically lock down in the event of the director’s death. Five containment team members had been killed. It was an extremely dangerous situation. If the monsters escaped into the city, the chaos would be uncontrollable.\nThe white hallway was drenched in the red glow of the emergency lights.\nThud. Thud. Thud.\nIt was hard to tell if the blood was red because of the lights or if it was actually blood. All the test subject did was keep stabbing.\nShe was a monster. That’s why she killed people. It was the research facility’s fault for not managing the situation properly.\nThud. Thud. Thud.\nShe had stabbed enough to be satisfied. The blaring alarm was annoying. The lights kept flashing.\nThe test subject’s gaze fell to the snack on the floor.\nThe bread had been stepped on, but the milk hadn’t burst.\nShe picked it up and dusted it off. Aside from the bread package being slightly torn, there was no issue. The bread had lost its shape a bit, but it was still fine.\nBut she still needed permission to eat it. The researcher was in the elevator. She opened the elevator door.\nThe researcher was lying there.\nTap, tap. She poked him, but he didn’t get up. She shook him, but it didn’t work either.\nHe was still alive.\nSo now, what should she do?\nThe elevator doors closed. It was quiet, and she couldn’t hear the noises from outside anymore.\nNom.\nShe pulled out the squashed bread and began to eat it. It tasted good.\nShe simply waited until Researcher A woke up.",

      "content": "\"—All staff, please evacuate.\n—There has been an incident in the facility, and casualties have been reported…\n—Suppression and rescue teams are en route.\"\n\"What the...\"\nThe researcher slowly came to his senses. He was inside the elevator.\nIt didn’t seem like much time had passed. The test subject was still nibbling on the snack, chewing thoughtfully. He must have only blacked out for a moment.\nLeaning against the elevator wall, he managed to stand up and pressed the button to open the door.\nAll he saw were corpses scattered across the floor. Each one had a hole through its head. Who could have done this?\nThere was no doubt—it was her.\n\"Haha...\"\nAt least she seemed to have enjoyed the snack. The problem, though, was that now there was no way to deny she might actually be a monster. And they were definitely being pursued.\nWas she truly a monster? Or an Awakened one? If she was an Awakened, then she was technically human.\nBut it seemed unlikely that a human could even survive in this facility.\n\"This is a serious problem. There’s no way out.\"\nBarrier walls had dropped down, blocking the corridors. They were designed to contain monsters from escaping. All the exits were sealed off.\nThe test subject was still leaning against the elevator door, waiting as if to tell him to get back inside.\n\"The elevator won’t go above the first floor. It’s still operational, though.\"\nDid she understand what he was saying? Either way, he explained the situation. She was clearly stronger than him, and up until recently, he’d thought she was someone to protect.\nCould she really be a monster? She had killed them all. The presence of so many corpses created an eerie atmosphere.\nThe test subject smiled, then pressed a button, closing the elevator doors.\n\"You can’t get outside that way…\"\nAnd just like that, she was gone.\nThe test subject defied understanding. One thing was certain—she wasn’t an ordinary little girl. He had no idea what she was doing.\n—Rescue team is entering the facility.\nEven if she went downstairs, there was no way out down there. It would only trap her further, as that area contained only cages of monsters.\n—Please proceed to a safe area until the rescue team arrives.\nThe loud announcements echoed in his ears. The rescue team was supposedly here to save him. From what exactly? Most likely, the test subject who had taken the elevator down.\n\"Ugh.\"\nThe researcher slumped against the wall. He could handle being hit with a golf club, but the place where he’d been kicked throbbed painfully. Even walking was difficult. Damn the director.\nThen again, there was no need to curse him. He was already dead.\n\"...Damn it.\"\nCompared to what they had done to the other test subjects, this was nothing. With other test subjects, it was justifiable. But with her…\nHe should have taken action much sooner.\nThe consequence of his negligence and complacency had led to this. He had expected a tragic outcome.\nBut things had taken an unexpected turn. Instead of him being dead, it was the director. And the containment team shouldn’t have been taken down so easily.\nWhat should he do now? Wait for the rescue team? But if he did, he didn’t know what would happen to her. What if she really was a monster? What if she escaped and started massacring people outside?\n—She’s a monster.\nLooking at the director’s corpse brought back their past conversations.\n—A monster. She’s going around killing people, that’s what I mean.\nThe implication was that she had been caught killing people outside, which was why she had been confined here. If that were true, he had to question his choice to free her.\nB1.\nThe elevator stopped. Did she get off? What was she doing?\nAbout thirty seconds later, the elevator started moving again.\nB2.\nThe second basement housed monsters awaiting experiments. He had no idea what she was doing down there.\nB3.\nB4.\nB5.\nThis time, she went straight down to the fifth basement. The problem was, he had no way of knowing what was going on. He’d never seen her this active before. Most of the time, she had just stayed quietly in her room.\nThe sirens continued blaring.\nB4.\nThe elevator stopped again, then after about five minutes, it moved once more.\nB3.\nThe elevator stopped again. Was it his imagination, or was there a strange noise?\nB2.\nB1.\nThe elevator was coming up, without any stops.\n1.\nThe elevator arrived, and the doors opened.\nCrunch.\nA young girl stepped out, munching on a chocolate bar. Just press a button, and food would come out.\n\"Oh, were you just hungry?\"\nWas that all it was? But that food was probably laced with drugs. For her health, it would be better to eat something else.\n\"Drug.\"\nThe test subject spoke. It wasn’t his imagination; she had definitely said something. The fact that she could talk was a shock.\n\"Dr-drug?\"\nShe nodded.\nWas she asking for drugs? There were many kinds. He tried to think about what she might want.\n\"......\"\nShe rolled up her white lab coat, revealing scars and pointing to injection marks on her skin. She mimed injecting herself, smiling.\nThen she held out her hand.\n\"You’re asking for drugs?\"\nShe nodded as if he’d finally understood, with a hint of madness in her smile.\nHe had a guess. It was that new drug made by grinding up dragon scales. He’d heard it was highly addictive.\nHe couldn’t understand why they would go through the trouble of grinding up dragon scales to make such a thing. But those who had used it had said nothing compared to it. He knew everyone who tried it had died that very day. This was information he’d only heard about because he worked in this facility.\nNow that he thought about it, she hadn’t died. Even large monsters hadn’t survived long after being administered the drug.\n\"Drug.\"\nThis time, her smile faded. She seemed to be serious. Her vocabulary seemed limited.\n\"To get that, we’d have to go to the lab... or maybe outside. It’s in a different building.\"\nDid she understand?\n\"It’s in the lab building. You’d see it on the lobby map, probably stored there. If not, it could be in the special materials storage… I’m not entirely sure. Sorry.\"\nHe gave her as much information as he could. She smiled as if satisfied.\n\"Thank you.\"\nShe even expressed gratitude. Politeness.\nShe knew how to be polite.\nThen she was human. Not a monster. The researcher chuckled. Even though the pain still lingered, he couldn’t help but laugh.\n\"Right…\"\nShe wasn’t a monster. Not throwing her into the incinerator had been the right choice. Anyone would have made the same choice if they had a shred of sanity.\n\"......\"\nThe test subject looked at him as if she had something to say. Her eyes were partially hidden by her hair, but he was certain she was looking at him.\n\"Heh...\"\nShe smiled. Then she spoke.\n\"Rest.\"\nSuddenly, his body went limp. It was hard to believe he’d been so tense just moments before.\nThen his eyes closed.\n---\nResearcher A was resting deeply, lying on the floor.\n[230 hours 12 minutes]\nThe time had to be replenished.\nThere were originally 240 hours left before she had told him to rest. They called it a \"word command\" or something similar. It was close to that. Ever since she’d been heavily dosed with drugs, it had been possible.\nNo matter what she said, her remaining time would tick down.\nHer very first command had been, \"Get lost.\"\nShe had told that to a researcher who’d entered her room carrying some food that looked vaguely like a meal. He’d actually left, and she hadn’t been fed for a while. It had taken some trial and error to realize the command had worked.\nAfter that, she had remained silent. Whether it was by choice or necessity was unclear.\nIn any case, her mind had deteriorated further. She knew she wasn’t entirely sane, but everything else was blurry.\nGet lost, just get lost.\nWhat had the researcher brought that made her say that? She couldn’t remember.\nTime had disappeared then as well. She had lost about 20 hours. It was a system she couldn’t understand.\nDrug. Drug.\nEven speaking single words cost her a couple of hours. That’s why she avoided speaking. She thought she might be able to write instead.\nIt had taken considerable courage to say thank you. But she’d wanted to express it.\n\"Heh.\"\nAt least laughing was free.\nBang.\nThe sound of something pounding against the barriers echoed.\nResearcher A would be rescued by the rescue team. But she was alone now.\nBang. Bang. Bang.\nThe barrier dented. Something was trying to break through.\nThud.\nThe thick metal wall crumbled. Behind it stood a monster with a drill-like head. Though it had no eyes and walked on six legs, it resembled a rhino or a hippo in shape, covered in scars.\nThe elevator wasn’t the only way up to the first floor. There were transport routes for monsters, as well as stairs. Everything was interconnected. Once the barriers were broken, they could go through.\nShe had ordered the drill-headed monster to break down everything in its path. Speaking that command had cost her over a hundred hours, but it had been worth it.\nShe wanted to tell it \"good job,\" but saying so would cost her time.\nYes.\nThere was no time.\nShe needed the drug.\nIf the researcher was right, there was a storage room\nwith it. Since she wasn’t the only one it was used on, there should be a considerable supply. That was the lab she was dragged into every other day.\nShe planned to head there first.\n—Please follow the instructions of the rescue team.\n—Military reinforcements are on the way.\nThe building shook as if there had been an earthquake. She knew the reason. She had released all the monsters held captive in the building.\n\"Break.\"\nBang!\nThe monster rammed its head into the wall beside her. Going through the corridors would be too slow. The barriers and walls were equally strong, so breaking through was just as effective.\n[222 hours 30 minutes]\nShe had lost around eight hours.\nBang. Bang. Bang.\nThe wall shattered, and an exit to the outside opened. The drill-headed monster charged forward, leaving a trail of dust and debris.\n—Military… upon sight… resistance… not advised…\nThe wall speakers seemed to be broken. It would have been strange if they hadn’t been damaged when she shattered the wall. The announcements crackled and then stopped entirely.\nFresh air began to flow in. It was nighttime. She wasn’t sure what time it was, but the air was cold.\nShe stepped outside the building. She could see the other escaped monsters rampaging around. In the distance, she saw some people by another building. She wasn’t sure if they were military, rescue personnel, or facility staff.\nShe knew where she needed to go. Her destination was the lab. That’s where the drugs would be.\n\"Ugh.\"\nHer legs gave out.\nThud.\nShe collapsed again. She couldn’t move. This was her usual state.\nBut now, she knew how to overcome it.\n\"Stand.\"\nStand.\nBy saying so, she was able to stand again. She had mumbled similarly when she saved Researcher A.\nIt worked again. She pushed herself up from the ground.\n[217 hours 46 minutes]\nShe could replenish her time with the drugs.\n\"Move.\"\n[206 hours 9 minutes]\nMove, move, move. She repeated the command to herself. Her legs started to move.\nShe understood what was happening. She was forcing her body to comply. But there was no other choice.\nThe moon was bright in the night sky. The air was cold.\nNow, where exactly was the lab building? Where were the drugs?\nA sign helpfully pointed her in the right direction.",

      "content": "Drugs.\nYes.\nDrugs.\nIt feels good to use them. Makes me happy.\nThere are different ways to feel happiness. I could lose myself in fantasies. Fantasies where I’m actually a happy person.\nWhat if being trapped in this white room is just a dream, and in reality, I’m living happily at home with my family? Playing outside with friends is fun. But when I dream, I end up trapped in this strange white room. It must be something like that.\n---\nI was playing. I was playing with my best friend. Happily. Just deciding what to play was fun.\nIt was an abandoned playground. The slide and swings were rusty, but we could still play on them.\n---\nIn the next moment, my arm was shattered. It wasn’t a playground anymore but a strange operating room. They said they were conducting an experiment. They injected drugs, claiming it was to measure my recovery. Drugs.\n---\nAnd then I was back at the playground. Playing. It was just a disturbing nightmare, nothing more.\nWe were each other’s only friend, the only ones we could rely on. So, it was good to be together.\nI didn’t know what the future held, but as long as we were together, everything felt fine. The future looked bright.\n---\nThen, in the next moment, everything went dark. What did they do to my eyes? I could only endure, despite my frustration. There was nothing I could do. And then, after a while, they injected drugs again.\n---\nThen the playground reappeared. I kept having bad dreams, and it was putting me in a bad mood. So, I complained to my friend.\n\"I had a bad dream.\"\n\"It’s alright. It’s just a dream.\"\nThey comforted me. That’s right. It was just a dream.\n---\nBut I still couldn’t see. It felt like something was burning. I heard them say they needed a different drug.\nI wished they’d get it right already. Whatever it was. Give me more drugs.\n---\nAnd then I was back at the playground again. The sky looked beautiful at dusk from the playground. Even the ruins of collapsing buildings looked lovely.\nNo one lived here, and no one cared for it. The population had dwindled, and those who survived had moved to the city. But there were still people here.\nA fence with a sign read, \"Children are the future.\" Before it became a ruin, there had been a small elementary school here.\n\"If we’re the future, then we’re the future, aren’t we?\"\n\"We are?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nWhat kind of future would that be? Were we hoping for a good future? Someday, we’d grow up and become someone amazing.\n---\nMy vision started to come back. I shouted, asking why they were pouring raw concentrate into my eyes. I didn’t know what the concentrate was, but it must’ve been drugs. Was it drugs, not tears, that were streaming down?\n---\nI was talking to my friend again. Peaceful, everyday conversation.\n\"What do you want to be when you grow up?\"\n\"Hmm.\"\nI thought hard. What should I be?\n\"Someone who helps others… something like that.\"\nThat was my answer. I had learned that helping others was a good thing. When I grew up, I wanted to be a kind person who helped others. A good person.\n---\nSo, was I helping people by being here? They said that through these experiments, I could help people. That I could save many. That this was meaningful work.\n---\nI had to be a good kid. Then adults would like me.\nLook, there’s a reason we can’t live in the city. Adults don’t like us. Our parents, relatives, and everyone else abandoned us. You too, right?\n\"Someday, when I’m better…\"\nBetter. That day would come. At the very least, I wouldn’t be a burden to others. I wouldn’t hold anyone back.\n\"Maybe…\"\nI would become someone remarkable. A good person.\n\"Maybe then my parents will recognize me and come back.\"\nI knew. They were dead. They’d all died, leaving me here alone after a monster raid.\n\"If I become really, really amazing, maybe they’ll come find me.\"\nBut you never know. They must be dead. But maybe not. Maybe my family survived.\n---\nMaybe they didn’t die after all. Just like I hadn’t died.\n\"A valuable test subject. Keep her secured.\"\nI was useful. I was helping others. I was doing something valuable.\nThen, one day, people would recognize me. My family would come back for me because I was a good kid. I wasn’t a burden. I didn’t get in anyone’s way. Don’t abandon me. Can’t we stay together?\n---\nThe sun was setting at the playground now. Still, it was comforting to have family. I was so lucky to have a friend who felt like family.\n\"Where are you?\"\nI was looking for my friend. We were playing hide-and-seek. We agreed only to hide near the playground, but they were nowhere to be seen.\n\"Hey, where are you?\"\nI couldn’t find them. Where had they gone?\n\"Sniff...\"\nI kept searching, but I couldn’t find them. I started to cry. I was scared.\n\"I’m here, I’m here. Sorry.\"\nThis was why we didn’t play hide-and-seek often. I’d cry if I felt even a little worried. Then again, with just the two of us, it wasn’t the best game to play. I didn’t like the feeling of being abandoned.\nI didn’t want anyone to leave me. I hated seeing people I was close to walk away. I hated it when people I knew turned their backs on me.\n---\nAt least I wasn’t abandoned. I was a useful test subject. Maybe I couldn’t be much else, but at least I was useful. That’s a meaningful life, isn’t it?\nBy the time I became an adult, I’d be a truly good person. Really. What kind of person would I be when I grew up?\nI’d live in a nice house with my family. I’d be very happy. Maybe I’d have lots of friends too.\n---\nI was starting to wonder what that friend’s name was. That close friend I’d played with at the playground.\nBut I couldn’t remember any names. I’d forgotten them all. I didn’t know why.\n\"Well, I…\"\nMy friend began to speak, with a look of determination.\n\"I want to help people too.\"\n\"Really.\"\nYou want to be a good person too. Just like me.\n\"And I’ll protect everyone.\"\nProtect? I didn’t know what that meant. It seemed like a huge responsibility. Could they really do it?\n\"Will you protect me too?\"\nProtecting everyone. That would include me.\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Wow.\"\n---\n\"Ah… aaah…\"\nMy legs wouldn’t move. My legs.\n\"They should heal in about three hours.\"\nMy legs wouldn’t move. They wouldn’t move. It hurt—something was wrong.\nIn three hours, I’d be fine. It felt like ages had passed. I looked at the clock—two hours and fifty-nine minutes left. Time dragged on. Still fifty-nine minutes to go. Now, it really felt like an eternity. Fifty-nine minutes. Still?\nBut I was a good person. Sacrifice? Is that what this is? I’m sacrificing myself to achieve something? That’s good, right?\n\"Hehe, hee, haha...\"\nYes! It’s a good thing!\n\"Are you… alright?\"\n\"I’ve always been this way.\"\nI’m a good kid, right? I’ve become a good kid, haven’t I? Everyone likes me, don’t they?\nYou won’t abandon me, right? You’ll protect me, won’t you?\nDrugs, more drugs. Just a little more.\n---\nAnd then I found them. The drugs were indeed in the lab, just like Researcher A had said.\nThe lab was on the fourth floor, large enough to hold even massive monsters.\n\"Aha.\"\nI leaned against the window, looking down at the scene outside. People were fighting. Most of the monsters had already been subdued.\nOne Awakened fighter stood out, eliminating the monsters. The light they emitted in the middle of the night was hard to miss. A hero. A protagonist.\nThat person… my friend.\nThe view from the lab felt even more special. It was a vast space.\nLast time, I’d been the one on the examination table. But this time, it was different. It wasn’t me lying on the floor this time.\nAnd thanks to that, I’d managed to get a lot of drugs.\nThud.\n[345 hours 16 minutes]\nClang.\nThe syringe fell to the floor. I remembered the happy memories as they resurfaced. There were bad memories too, but that couldn’t be helped.\nI’d wanted to be a good person. But they said they were going to dispose of me. Throw me into the incinerator.\nI was only giving back what I’d received. They wouldn’t have lasted thirty seconds.\nI still didn’t understand. I was doing good, wasn’t I? This was supposed to be good work. Why didn’t they praise me? Why did they try to throw me away?\nA sparkle.\nThrough the window, a light flashed again. Wow, a star. I’d wanted to look at the stars.\nThud.\n[353 hours 53 minutes]\nI remembered that I’d planned to go star-gazing with my friend. I’d probably see stars from the rooftop. But looking alone would feel lonely.\nA few more flashes of light, and the monsters collapsed. It didn’t seem like my friend was alone. The beams of light from afar were probably spells cast\nby allies.\nImpressive. It was a beautiful scene from a distance. I didn’t want to get any closer.\nSoon, the monsters would be completely contained. There were more people being rescued than fleeing. I could see people entering the lab building.\nA faint thumping echoed. Someone was climbing the building.\n\"This is the rescue team. You’re safe now!\"\nThat’s what they said.\n\"What… what could have done this… there might still be monsters inside. Stay alert.\"\nVoices echoed from the hallway. They were almost at my location.\nThud.\n\"Sigh.\"\nI felt good.\n[361 hours 13 minutes]\nI’d used up all the drugs in this room. There was less than I’d expected.\nBang!\nThe door was flung open as the rescue team entered. Five armed people. They looked horrified at the sight inside the lab. The room was filled with the bodies of both monsters and humans.\nI was the only one left alive. They spotted me.\n\"Please save me.\"\nI smiled as I spoke.\nThey’d come to save me. Who else could they be here for?\nI was lucky someone had come to rescue me, even now.",

      "content": "I just wanted to watch.\nTo simply watch.\nTo go back to that moment of reading a book, watching the protagonist grow, seeing what trials they overcome, how they make friends, how they lead others.\nBut I couldn’t.\nBecause I was trapped in a strange place.\nA small space where all I could do was fantasize.\nThey came to rescue me too late.\nI remembered a book I’d read. When I tried to recall its content, all I could remember was a story where I died. But I also remembered everyone was happy in the end. It had a happy ending.\nA happy ending.\n[330 hours]\nMaybe the time I see ticking before me isn’t just a drug effect. It’s time I shouldn’t have, time I’m borrowing to exist. Time that could only burden others. If I added up all the time I’d accumulated so far… how much would it be?\nIn the last pages of that faintly remembered novel, I wasn’t there. I wasn’t the only one missing, but… there was someone else beside the protagonist, someone who fit perfectly. They had many friends.\n[329 hours 59 minutes]\n\"Ah…\"\nWhen I opened my eyes, I was home.\nHome?\nNo, that couldn’t be.\nIt was a messy room, with rotting wood and a leaking ceiling. Even the cobwebs had been abandoned by their owners.\nIt looked like a home, but it was just a ruin.\nDefinitely not my home.\nI tried to think about why I was here. I remembered asking the rescue team to save me. And after that… what happened?\nI started counting time by folding out my fingers. There were still about 330 hours left… so maybe a day had passed. Last time I’d used the drug, it had been at 360 hours or so.\n—Ah, home.\nI think I’d said that. Maybe in the rescue team’s vehicle. I saw a place that looked like a house. It looked similar to where I used to live.\nBut this wasn’t my home.\nI’d just mistaken it for one.\nAfter getting out of the rescue vehicle, I must’ve just wandered into some random house and fallen asleep. I’d been so tired. It was quiet—no people, no monsters.\nMaybe I should try going outside.\n\"......\"\nNo surprise, my body wouldn’t move.\nI couldn’t move.\nThis was hopeless.\nHaha.\nI let out a small laugh.\nMaybe it wouldn’t be such a bad decision to stay like this. Just lie here until the drug’s effects wear off, and then… die.\nHonestly, it wasn’t a bad option. There’d be no more trips back to the lab. No more biological experiments.\n\"...Get up.\"\nEven speaking was a chore.\nJust waking up made things feel heavier.\n\"[Get up.]\"\nI managed to stand.\nI could move.\nLight streamed in from outside.\nIn the morning light, I could see the mold on the walls more clearly.\nMorning.\nLight.\nThe outside world.\nIt had been so long.\nYesterday had been filled with strange events, so I hadn’t really gotten a chance to enjoy it.\n\"Aha...\"\nIn my pocket were four syringes I’d kept as spares. Enough for emergencies.\n[322 hours 41 minutes]\nTime was slipping away at an alarming rate. But I was grateful I could move, even if only with the drug.\nYes.\nAll I needed was the drug.\nIt had always been that way.\nIt might have worsened recently, but…\nI looked in a mirror on the wall. With some dust wiped away, I could see myself clearly.\n\"...Oh.\"\nMy bangs had grown long and blocked my view a bit.\nIsn’t something different?\nI pushed my hair aside to get a better look. My eye looked… strange.\n\"Hmm?\"\nWas it because of what happened in the lab? Had it been like this since then? They’d done something weird to my eyes.\nA slit pupil.\nLike a cat’s eye?\nOr maybe a lizard’s?\nIt was only my right eye, which made it stand out even more.\n\"......\"\nWhy?\nWas it the drugs?\nAt least it could be hidden behind my bangs, so that was fortunate.\nEverything seemed fine on the surface.\nI didn’t look sick.\nWell, I had used a lot of drugs, after all.\nYes.\nAs long as I had the drugs, I could make it work.\nI should go find more.\nStaying here would just waste time.\nTime to go outside.\nThe streets looked abandoned, like they had been this way for a while. But it didn’t seem completely deserted. There were signs that people were still living here.\n\"Yula!\"\nA voice called out, as if searching for someone.\nIt sounded like a child. A boy, by the tone.\n\"Yula?!\"\nI stepped outside to check.\nHe looked about nine or ten.\n\"Yul—oh, wh-who are you?\"\nI smiled, hoping to appear harmless.\n\"Oh, do you live here?\"\nI shook my head.\nI lived somewhere similar, but…\nHis gaze measured me, wondering if I was trustworthy.\n\"...Anyway, have you seen a girl about this tall?\"\nHe gestured to show she was a bit shorter than him.\nLooks like he’s looking for a friend.\n\"We were playing, but I can’t see her… I think she might be hiding.\"\nI shook my head again.\nSadly, I hadn’t seen her.\n\"Oh, I see. If you do, could you—\"\nHe trailed off awkwardly. I nodded to indicate I’d help him look.\nBut how would I search? It didn’t feel right to call out her name.\nStill, I tried to help, wandering the streets here and there. Mostly, I stayed near the boy.\n\"Yula! Where are you?\"\nIf she were nearby, she’d have come out by now. Maybe they were playing hide-and-seek. Or maybe she’d gotten lost.\n\"I’m here!\"\nThe girl jumped out from behind the boy.\n\"Geez. I was worried.\"\nMaybe she’d just been hiding to tease him.\n\"But who’s this lady?\"\nThe word \"lady\" felt odd to hear.\n\"I dunno. She was here. She helped me look for you.\"\n\"Wow… Hi, lady! I’m Yula, and he’s Hyun.\"\nShort names, it seemed. They must have their reasons for living here.\n\"What’s your name?\"\nI wanted to answer, but speaking would cost me time.\n\"Oh, are you from the factory too?\"\nHyun asked.\nThere must be a factory nearby.\n\"Right? Factory people don’t talk much. It’s to prevent information leaks or something.\"\n\"But she’s not wearing a mask.\"\n\"...Maybe not?\"\nThey started debating among themselves.\nAt least they didn’t seem to think I was dangerous.\n\"[Factory?]\"\nThe factory sounded interesting.\n\"Yeah, the people from the factory kill monsters.\"\nA factory that kills monsters? Then it must also process them as materials.\nIt might even be the same factory where they make the drugs.\nIt wasn’t that far from the lab area, after all. I’d been dropped off not far from here by the rescue team. I remembered hearing about a factory district nearby. Maybe it was mentioned in the lab; I couldn’t recall exactly.\n\"And they give us food and medicine.\"\n\"Medicine?\"\n\"Yeah, the factory people come and give us medicine. They ask if anyone’s hurt.\"\nWas it the same medicine I knew? Were they giving it to kids? No, it was probably just regular medicine.\n\"[Like this?]\"\nI pulled out a syringe to show them.\n\"Um… never seen that. Is it a pen?\"\n\"It’s got a long needle. Looks like a syringe.\"\nI put it away. Thankfully, they didn’t recognize it. Hopefully, they weren’t giving those kids the drugs I was familiar with.\nWhy did I start taking it again?\n-Doctor?\n---\nA doctor?\nYes.\nThe doctor.\nI remembered the first time I met the doctor. I’d been coughing.\nI needed medicine for a cold, so I went to get some.\nEven the shelter in the slums had closed down.\nIt was sad, as they sometimes gave me food. But it was gone now.\nI stood at the empty site of the abandoned shelter.\n\"Where can I get medicine?\"\nThe hospital was far away.\nThe city was far too distant, and I had no money.\nIt wasn’t surprising, really. Why would anyone bother to hand out medicine and food in the slums? Still, I couldn’t help feeling disappointed.\n\"Maybe I’ll just have to tough it out.\"\nThe coughing was relentless.\nThere were no other shelters nearby. If the one here was gone, it was likely the others had closed too.\nI figured I should head back. But just as I decided to leave—\n\"Are you looking for a doctor?\"\nA person in a black coat stood there.\nThey looked suspicious.\n\"Yes…\"\n\"I heard there were still patients around, even though the shelter’s closed, so I came.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"I’m a doctor. If you need anything, I can provide it.\"\nThat was my first encounter with the doctor.\n\"I need… medicine for a cold.\"\n\"Oh, yes. I happen to have some that was given specifically to help those in need. By the way, may I have your name?\"\n\"Suh Ah Yoon. Yoon Suh Ah.\"\nThat was my name. I remembered.\n\"Alright, Yoon Suh Ah. This is cold medicine. I heard there were patients around here, so if you know anyone else who’s sick, have them come by.\"\nThey handed me a packet of medicine, the same kind the shelter used to give.\n\"The cost…\"\nI didn’t have much money.\nThe shelter had sold the medicine cheaply, but how much would this doctor charge?\n\"It’s free. I might charge next time, but it won’t be expensive.\"\n\"Thank you. Um… should I come to the shelter to find you?\"\nI might need more medicine in the future.\n\"Yes. I’ll be around here.\"\n\"Um… since you’re a doctor, don’t you have a hospital?\"\n\"In the city. Just think of me as someone temporarily assigned here. I plan to stay here for a while. There are other patients besides you.\"\n\"Ah, thank you.\"\n\"See you again.\"\n\"Goodbye.\"\nThey were an odd person.\nVery different from the doctors at the shelter. Younger, with a different way of speaking.\nBut I got my medicine, so I guess that was good.\nI swallowed the pills.\nThe same medicine I’d always taken.\nAnd for about a month, I didn’t feel sick.\nThe next time my cough worsened, I went back. The medicine had changed shape a bit.\nIt worked for about a week.\nThen I went back again.\nIt worked for about four days.\nAnd I went back again.\nIt worked for two days.\nThen again.\nEventually, the medicine I received was no longer in pills but a liquid in a syringe.\nI learned how to administer it.\nI hadn’t realized how complicated syringes were to use.\nAnd I learned that the doctor was a kind person.\nI didn’t know exactly why, but he said he was kind.\nSo, he must have been.\nEven if he were kind, I probably used to smile like that too.\n---\nI patted their heads.\n\"Sis? What’s wrong?\"\nYula smiled.\nNext to her, Hyun’s expression was bright too.\nThat’s right.\nKids are meant to smile like that.\nThey’re the future.\nWas I the future once?\nIf someone like me was the future, was the hope, that would be a disaster.\n—Children are the future.\nThe words I’d seen on the playground fence as we played.\nThe voice of my friend saying, \"We’re the future.\"\nIs this how adults treat children?\nWas it because I wasn’t that young anymore?\nDid they just enjoy ruining the future?\nDid I lack the qualities needed to be the future?\nOr had I done something wrong?\nWhy had they messed me up so badly, Yoon Suh Ah?\n\"Are you… crying, sis?\"\nTears pricked my eyes as I patted Hyun’s head.\nThese were real tears, not the drug.\nRight?\n[285 hours 4 minutes]\nI should be happy while on the drug.\nI was always happy before.",

      "content": "\"Are you hungry, sis?\"\nAs we walked and talked, Yula looked up at me and asked. Come to think of it, I hadn’t eaten. The drug made it so I didn’t really need to, but it’d probably be healthier to have a meal.\n\"Want to see our hideout?\" Yula offered.\n“What’ll we eat? The stuff you got last time? Do you have water?”\n“Yep. We have some left.”\nYula grabbed my hand and pulled me along.\nI followed her lead, weaving through run-down buildings and piles of dirt, walking along roads that were far from maintained. The kids chattered excitedly as they walked, their voices bringing a lightness to the day.\n\"Over here!\"\nWe rounded a few corners before arriving at a doorway made from a haphazard patchwork of plastic panels.\n“It’s our secret base. But you have to keep it a secret, okay?”\nI nodded.\nA secret base—it had a nostalgic appeal.\nInside, the space was surprisingly large and well-organized.\n“This used to be a restaurant. We found a secret passage to get in!”\n“It’s just the back door.”\n“No, it’s a secret entrance!”\n“Everyone knows about it. What’s so secret about that?”\n“It’s definitely secret!”\nThey squabbled as they showed me around. It was strangely endearing.\n“Anyway, let’s eat! I’ll give you some of the food we got!”\nThey rummaged around in the cabinets.\n“Oh, sis, just add water to this, and it’ll turn into a meal. They say just eating this isn’t enough, so we have side dishes too…”\n“I even have snacks! Cookies!”\n“You can have cookies after you finish your meal.”\n“Ew, fine…then…”\nYula dug around in the cabinet a bit more.\n“Seaweed? …Oh, we ate all that. Oh, here’s something!”\nShe held up a can of tuna.\n“Oh, but we have to eat outside. If we cook it in here, the smell will get everywhere.”\n“There’s a chair outside, too.”\nThey were good kids, sharing food with a stranger like this. It wasn’t easy to stay kind in a place like this. Even so, it seemed better here than the place I’d lived before. There, no one was around to take care of the monsters, and free meals were hard to come by.\nI took the can of tuna from them.\n—What would you like to eat most?\nA voice from the past echoed in my mind.\nA friend? Was it a friend who’d asked me that?\nI remembered sharing food with someone before. But it wasn’t my friend’s voice.\nA strange queasiness hit my stomach, a nausea that bubbled up from within.\n“Urk…”\nI felt sick.\nTuna was a food I despised. I must have.\n“Yuck, do you hate it? I guess we’ll have to find something else.”\nI’m sorry. I didn’t mean to reject your kindness like that. Did I hate it enough to hurt their feelings?\nBack home, I used to keep cans of it and eat them all the time. My taste must have changed.\nEven so, the instant rice was good enough. They had stir-fried rice with a few side dishes.\n“Oh? You’re picky, too, sis?”\nPicky?\nI was just picking out the radish and some vegetables, that’s all.\n“Not very tasty, huh? Like broccoli.”\n“It’s good for your health.”\nRight. Eating everything is important for good health.\nI didn’t really dislike any foods. I could eat almost anything as long as it wasn’t spoiled.\nLeaving the vegetables aside…why was that? Sometimes you just don’t feel like eating certain things.\nIn any case, this was a lot better than the food I’d been given in the lab. There, I’d just forced myself to eat whatever they gave me.\nNow I was suddenly being picky?\nStill, I was grateful for the meal.\n“Oh, are you leaving? To go to the factory?”\n“She might not be from the factory.”\n“Play with us!”\nI wanted to, honestly. Maybe someday, if I had the time.\n\"...Where are you going, sis?\"\nI nodded slightly.\nI had to go.\n[283 hours 21 minutes]\nTo the factory. Maybe for these kids.\nOr maybe just to get more drugs.\nEither way, I’d planned to go to the factory for a long time. I’d noticed the logo on the food packaging just now. It was the same logo as the company that made the drugs. It was etched into my memory, impossible to forget. The logo was on the packaging of the instant meal and the food supplies. This factory had to be linked to the drugs somehow.\nPerhaps it was a good place, a factory that provided essential supplies and medicine while taking care of the monsters.\nA facility like that doesn’t exist in this world.\nBut it would’ve been nice if it had.\n“Oh, the doctor?”\nHyun, looking over my shoulder, said.\n“It’s the doctor!”\nDoctor?\nI turned around to check.\nAnd there he was—the doctor.\nHe was here, standing right behind me. How did he know where I was?\nI could just kill him. Attack him.\nNo, but the doctor was kind; I shouldn’t hurt him.\nI was angry, but I couldn’t understand why. Oh, was it because he’d taken so long to get here?\n“It’s been so long, doctor!”\nYula greeted him warmly.\n\"...Heh.\"\nDoctors really do just pop up anywhere. It was kind of amazing.\n“Hello, Miss Suh Ah. Long time no see.”\n“You know her, doctor? Her name’s Suh Ah?”\n“Yes, I’ve come to take Suh Ah back. I should have come sooner. Were you all playing together?”\n“We were going to.”\nI couldn’t think straight.\nNormal thoughts just wouldn’t come.\nWas it because we hadn’t seen each other in so long?\n“Here, I brought some snacks. Share them, okay?”\n“Wow!”\n“Thank you!”\nCould I trust that? Probably.\nThe doctor was a good person.\n“You’ve been well, I hope? Haha, it’s been a while.”\nHe started a conversation as if everything were fine.\nIt seemed normal, but…\nWasn’t this strange?\nWhy was the doctor here? Why were the kids so friendly with him?\nWhy now?\nMaybe I was lucky. The doctor would probably give me more drugs.\nHe was always a good person.\nMy mind felt scrambled.\nI couldn’t think of him as anything other than good.\n“I need to have a private conversation with her. Would it be okay if I took her along?”\nHe seemed to have finished talking to the kids.\n“Okay! Come back soon!”\n“Bye!”\nIt all ended so quickly.\nEven saying goodbye was over in a blink.\n“Shall we go?”\nThe doctor held out his hand.\nWas I supposed to take it?\nI hesitated. There was nothing sinister in his hand.\nBut my instincts were screaming that something was wrong.\nHow many times had this happened? I couldn’t even think straight or control my own body anymore, and it felt all wrong.\n\"[Get a grip.]\"\nSuddenly, my mind cleared.\nI had one goal: kill the doctor.\nJust this one person’s death would bring a little more peace to the world.\nBeloved drug, grant me a weapon—a sword, anything—to end him.\nEven if he was a good person, I couldn’t let him keep reaching out to the kids. It should be enough that he’d treated only me.\n—Thump.\nThe drug was injected.\nFrom my nerves to the center of my brain, everything started burning. My entire body tingled, and I felt my strength drain away.\n[404 hours 5 minutes]\nGreat.\nI got the drug.\nIt looked like I’d gained over a hundred hours.\nClatter.\nA partially formed black blade fell to the ground before dissolving away.\nAh, I’d failed.\nBut I felt good.\nVery good.\n“Haha…”\nIt seemed to have worked out well.\nThe doctor really was a good person.\nI’d just wait a little longer. There might be a better time to deal with him.\nOnce I’d stockpiled more drugs, I could think about it again.\n“This isn’t really my jurisdiction, but as long as a military factory is operating here, I can travel easily.”\nDid he come through a portal? That was quite an impressive ability.\n“I was actually planning to visit you, Miss Suh Ah, at some point. I’m not sure if you remember, but…”\nHe paused, holding my hand as we walked.\nIt felt almost…nice.\n“After all, it was a path you chose willingly.”\n\"...\"\nWillingly?\nWhatever it was, I didn’t remember making that choice.\nI couldn’t imagine why I would have.\n“Haha, maybe you just don’t remember. It has been a long time.”\nWhat was he talking about?\n“There are quite a few people who are grateful to you, Miss Suh Ah. Thanks to you, our work on testing the efficacy of the drug went much faster.”\nA lot of experiments were done.\nConsidering how many chunks of memory had vanished, it must’ve been over a significant period.\n“If it hadn’t been you, we would’ve needed to find someone else.”\nHis hand was as gentle as could be.\nBut I couldn’t understand.\nWhy was he explaining all this so kindly?\nI glanced at the empty syringe in his other hand.\nThanks to him, I felt happy.\n“Oh, this? It’s quite a potent drug. While we don’t manufacture it here, I brought it just in case.”\nI didn’t know what it was needed for.\n[404 hours]\nI hoped he’d keep giving it to me.\n“It’s mixed with a\nhigh concentration of pure extract…not something just anyone can use. But you, Miss Suh Ah, deserve it.”\nRight.\nI deserved it.\nAfter all that I’d endured in that white room, didn’t I have the right to claim a little pleasure?\n“You didn’t want to see your friends?”\n“Huh?”\n“Back at the lab. You must have seen them.”\nFriends.\n“The academy had training near here, so they were around, and I was nearby because of that.”\nFriends?\nThe scene inside the lab flashed in my mind. I’d seen lights in the distance.\nThey were fighting monsters.\nThere wasn’t really a place for me there.\nOf course, I wanted to see my friends.\nThat’s why I’d watched from afar.\nI was satisfied with just observing.\nMe showing up wouldn’t change anything.\nAs sad as it was, that was the truth.\nSo, there was no reason for me to see my friends in the future.\n“Would you mind sitting down?”\nIt was a bench with no backrest.\nOld, but usable.\n“I’m fairly aware of your condition, but as long as I’m responsible, it’s my duty to check.”\nSince when was that a duty?\n“There’s no one else around.”\nIs that so?\nWhy does that matter?\n“Now, could you lift your shirt?”\n\"...Huh?\"\nWhy?\n“It’s just an examination.”\nThe stethoscope around his neck came into view.\nOh, right. He was a doctor, so of course he’d want to check.\nBut here?\nWhy?\nI didn’t want to lift my shirt.\nNot because I was embarrassed.\nThe feeling was more like fear.\nA similar situation had happened before.\nI’d had to lift my shirt to check bruises on my stomach.\nBut this was different.\nIf it were just a bruise, I wouldn’t mind.\nNo, on second thought, maybe it was embarrassment after all.\nThere were scars.\nJust a few scars, that’s all.\nThe doctor waited.\n\"Haha...\"\nBad memories resurfaced.\nIt would’ve been better if I’d forgotten.\nIt wasn’t some big deal, just childish pranks.\nJust a prank.\nI was over it by now, so it should be fine.\nDid he already know about the scars?\nHe didn’t seem like he’d even use the stethoscope.\nPainful memories flooded back.\nAnd it was all because of that cursed tuna can.\nTuna.",

      "content": "It was the tuna cans that were the problem.\nI don't remember the exact date, but it was definitely a long time ago.\nIn the lab.\nThey seemed to be studying how much of the drug to use to ensure scars healed without leaving any marks.\nWhy they were experimenting on my body, I couldn't understand.\n“Is there anything you want to eat?”\nA researcher asked.\n“I thought you might be hungry.”\nWere they talking to me?\n“Me?”\n“No, I’m not asking you.”\nThe researcher, who was staring at the computer screen, turned to look in my direction.\n“This thing can talk?”\n“Apparently, it speaks occasionally if prompted.”\n“Really?”\nI can talk.\nI just keep quiet because they complain it’s noisy when I speak.\nPlus, no one really talks to me.\nAfter all, who would want to question a bloodied creature? I was something to avoid.\n“What’s your favorite food?”\nWhat was it again? Let me think.\n“It’s not answering.”\n“No, it will. Just ask about its favorite food.”\nThere were a few people I liked. The ones who were kind.\n“What do you like to eat?”\nEating… What had I eaten a lot of? What was it?\n“Does it need to be told to eat before it understands?”\nNot much was coming to mind.\n“Um…”\n“Oh, it speaks.”\n“Tuna… can…”\n“It said tuna can.”\nA can of tuna I once shared with Shihu.\nWe had it at home. It was delicious.\nIt wasn’t cheap, so we couldn’t eat it often. Tuna triangle kimbap was good too.\nBut I could only get it if I went all the way to the city.\nI remember Shihu cutting his hand while opening a can.\nIt didn’t open easily. There was blood. Blood.\n“Ha?”\nWhat are they doing?\nWhat are they doing?\nThey’re doing something with a knife.\nA pocketknife.\nThey lightly slash my lower abdomen, drawing a line as if with a pencil.\n“Let’s write down that it likes tuna cans.”\n“Leaving it as a scar?”\n“Hm.”\nWhat are they talking about?\n“Or should I draw a picture? Since it said it was hungry.”\nI never said I was hungry.\nWhat does drawing have to do with being hungry?\n“A tuna can, huh?”\n“I can’t put it in your stomach, but I can draw it on there.”\nWhat nonsense is this?\nI thought the scar experiments were over, and they had just worked on my arm.\nI was restrained and couldn’t move.\nI was too weak to resist in the first place.\nThere was no way to stop them.\nI still didn’t understand.\nWhat were they doing to me?\n“Show it to your friends when you meet them.”\nThey said, sneering.\n“If someone asks what you want to eat, you can just show them this.”\n“No, ugh.”\nWhat did they do to me?\nI hate it.\n“Isn’t this a good thing? After all, it can barely talk anyway.”\nWhat are they saying?\nWhat are they talking about?\nI wanted to close my eyes, but for some reason, even that was hard.\nA tuna can?\nThe memory feels tainted.\nI don’t want to eat tuna cans anymore.\nEating it with Shihu was nice.\nBut why carve it into my body?\nAh.\nI’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.\nI don’t like tuna cans.\nPlease, don’t use that.\nDon’t draw on my body.\nWhat are you doing?\n“It’s not coming out right. Ovals are hard to draw.”\n“Just write it in words.”\n“It’s hard to do with a knife. What should I write?”\nI hate tuna cans.\nBut I liked the ones I ate with Shihu.\nNo, but I hate it.\nBut tuna cans are tasty.\nI like tuna.\nBut why write it on my body?\nWhy?\nI don’t get it.\n“Aah…”\nAm I the tuna can?\nOr am I just like a tuna can?\nI once asked Shihu if we could eat it together.\nWe even tried tuna ice cream once.\nI liked it.\nShihu bought me tuna because I liked it so much.\nIt was delicious.\nBut there’s no reason to carve it into my body.\nShihu would know without me saying anything.\nEven if it’s written here, no one will understand.\n“Why tuna can?”\n“Maybe someone gave it as food? Like they would for a cat.”\nWhy do they do this?\nWith Shihu, at home, we didn’t have much, just rice and ramen.\nSo, when we had it occasionally, it was good.\nI liked it.\nI shouldn’t have said I liked it.\nI shouldn’t have said I liked it.\nI shouldn’t have said I liked it.\nWhat are they doing?\nA sense of helplessness fills me.\n“Heh.”\nSomething inside me breaks off.\nIt’s fine.\nIt doesn’t matter if they do things to my body.\nNo one will know anyway.\nI just won’t show it to my friends.\nTuna can.\nI like it.\nThere’s no need to write it down, is there?\nNo need.\nThunk.\nThey injected a small dose of the drug.\nIf the recovery effect is minimal, a scar will remain.\nA scar was left behind.\nThe carefully written letters and drawings remained.\nTuna can.\nLikes it.\nThat’s what it says.\nThere’s no way something like this happened to me.\nWho went through this?\nYoo Seo Ah?\nWho is that?\nWho, who, who.\nI don’t think it’s me.\nHaha.\nTime passed.\nAnd still, the scar didn’t disappear.\nToday’s experiment supervisor said they’d have coffee in the morning tomorrow.\nI see.\nThey gave me their shopping list.\nThey’re buying lots of vegetables.\nAnd fruit.\nSpecifically, a bundle of cabbage, five radishes, a box each of apples and pears.\nOh, and they’re getting cereal too.\nLooks like they’re buying beer as well.\nIt’s a shopping list.\nThat’s something for a memo pad, not a person’s back.\nPeople aren’t memo pads.\nEven if it’s inconvenient to find pen and paper.\nMost of the scribbling is done on my back.\nIt seems like writing on the stomach doesn’t work well, so they write on the back.\nI wonder if these scars will disappear.\nI also learned the initials of one of the researchers.\nWhat was it… Something that started with a K.\nThey left it on my shoulder like a signature.\nPracticing their signature, apparently.\nI don’t know why they used a box cutter to do it.\nThey were probably just bored.\nLuckily, most of the marks didn’t scar over.\nThe drug is effective, so many wounds healed completely.\nWhy is graffiti a trend?\nI wonder if they scribble on other creatures like me.\nPerhaps the researcher who wrote “tuna” spread the word.\n“Hmm.”\nWhat if Shihu sees?\nWhat if my friend sees?\nWhat would they think of me?\nWhat did they say last time?\nThink carefully.\nAt the end, didn’t I hear something harsh?\nDid they call me trash?\nNo, that’s not it.\nHow do I prove it?\nPeople just came and left scribbles.\nHehe.\nWhy did they do that?\nDo you want to join them?\nWhat should I do? What should I do?\nPeople will think I’m strange if they see this.\nWhat should I do?\nDo you like tuna cans?\nNo.\nThen why is it written on your stomach?\nI don’t know.\nI don’t know.\nI don’t know.\nI don’t know.\nThey did it to me.\nThey said it was break time in the lab.\nI didn’t do anything.\nWhy is there a shopping list on my back?\nI don’t know.\nThey said they were going shopping.\nMaybe they like using me as a memo pad.\nIs there a phone number here?\nIs there?\nI don’t get it.\nThey said they would erase it with medicine to keep me clean for future notes.\nDid it get erased?\nProbably.\nI could check in a mirror, but I’m too scared.\nI just want to pretend it’s not there.\nThat it never happened.\nI didn’t want to show anyone the scars that were already on my arms.\nBut I could show my friend.\nBut this tuna can scar, I don’t understand it.\nWhat if someone notices?\nWill they think I’m crazy?\nWill they think I’m just a little strange?\nYou know…\nThey wrote \"likes tuna cans\" because I said it.\nIsn’t it pretty?\nHeh.\n“There’s no way.”\nRight.\nWhat I’m saying doesn’t even make sense.\n“Heh…”\nI’m alone in the room anyway.\nNo one else is here to see me.\n“Haha…”\nEven if I slightly lift my shirt, the rough drawing of a tuna can is visible.\nThey wrote “likes tuna” on me.\n“Heheh…”\nI laugh because it doesn’t make sense.\nI just…\nI liked eating with Shihu.\nWhen they asked what I liked to eat, that’s what I said.\n“Hehehe…”\nThe drug makes me feel good.\nBut I can’t shake the feeling that something’s wrong.\nWhat if I didn’t know?\nWhat if, one day, I could be close to people again, like I was before?\n“I just want to pretend it didn’t happen.”\nI don’t like tuna cans.\nSo there’s no reason to call it my favorite food.\nNo reason for them to carve it onto me.\nBut does liking something mean it should be written on my skin?\nI don’t even like vegetables that much.\nSo why write a shopping list on me?\nWhat if my friends see?\n“It’s not like I’m leaving here, right?”\nI can’t get out.\nI’m not supposed to get out.\n“There are no friends left anyway, so it’s fine.”\nThe people I knew—I’ll never meet them again.\nAnd even if I did, they wouldn’t recognize me.\nIt doesn’t matter anymore.\nI never planned to meet them again.\nI just wanted to watch.\nLet the main character handle everything while I just observe.\n“Forget it. Just forget it.”\nI’ll forget.\nI’ve forgotten so much already.\nI’ll forget.\nI’ll forget.\nI’ll forget.\n“Haha…”\nFor someone who remembers nothing important…\n“…[Forget it.]”\nAnd then, I really did forget.\nUntil the doctor reminded me, just a moment ago.\nHyperventilation.\n“Ha- haa, haa…”\n[394 hours and 12 minutes]\nDespite the effects of the drug, it seems the trauma has resurfaced.\nThe scar is no longer visible.\nThe doctor wrapped it with a bandage.\nThough it only covered the lower abdomen, it was enough.\n“Haa, haaa…”\nMy breathing is labored.\nIn the end, the real issue hasn’t been resolved, has it?\nIt wasn’t overcoming anything—it was just something I had forgotten.\nBut now, I’m out of the comfort of forgetting.\nIt’s just some graffiti.\nA small prank.\n“[It’s fine.]”\nIs it?\nI start to feel calmer.\nMy breathing slows.\n“[Relax.] It’s just some writing.”\nIs that right?\nYes.\nI feel relieved.\n“Oh, and I have all the experiment video recordings.”\n“……”\nVideo recordings.\nThey even record these things?\n“There’s no need to worry; your friends won’t ever see these videos.”\nHow much does the doctor know?\nIf he’s seen footage of the experiments…\nIf he’s known about the experiments all along…\nIf he’s aware I was trapped there…\nWhy didn’t he come to save me?\nHe’s supposed to be a good person.\nAnd he is a good person.\nHe must be.\nWhy was I put in such a place in the first place?\nThe doctor says it was my choice, but I have no memory of it.\n“All surveillance footage has been collected.”\nAnyway, it’s a happy ending.\nThe people who hurt me—I killed them all.\nI made them suffer the same way.\nThey didn’t even last 30 seconds.\nMaybe I should have asked them what they liked.\n“No one else knows that Seo Ah killed them, aside from me.”\nNo one knows.\n“…Huh?”\nA killer?\n“You partially destroyed the facility. If the public knew, they’d call you a villain. If not for me, that is.”\nDoes the doctor know everything?\nIf he hadn’t been there, who knows what would have happened.\nHe really is a good person.\n“I’ll keep the video recordings safe for now, especially the experimental footage. I think it might come in handy later. Don’t worry; I’ll keep it secure.”\nThere’s no reason it should be needed.\nIs he threatening me?\n“Oh, it’s not a threat… you really don’t seem to remember.”\nThe doctor continued, looking somewhat troubled.\n“There’s someone who owes you a debt. Someone who is a beneficiary. Do you remember?”\nA debt?\nA beneficiary?\nI don’t know what he’s talking about.\nI have no idea.\n“She’s called a saint. She lives happily now, having forgotten everything…”\nThe doctor neatly adjusted my clothes.\n“It’s time to collect on that debt.”\nHe held my hand and helped me up from the bench.\n“It’s chilly. Shall we go talk inside?”",

      "content": "“It’s a nice place. Though guests are rare.”\nThe place we arrived at was a café near the factory.\nIt’s an unmanned café.\nThere are no staff, but everything was neatly organized.\nSmall tables are set up between long sofas.\nThere’s enough space for several people to sit, but only two are using it.\n“Well, there’s a lot to talk about…”\nThe doctor pours himself a cup of coffee.\nAnd an orange juice cup for me.\n“If we’re going to have a conversation…”\nHe brings the cups filled with drinks to the table.\nThe coffee goes to him, and the orange juice comes my way.\nPlop.\nA pill drops into the juice.\n“It’s easier to communicate in human language.”\nThe pill dissolves.\nIt disappears without a trace.\nI drink it.\nIt has a strange taste for orange juice.\nIt tastes good, though.\nI keep sipping, feeling a warmth in my throat.\n**[393 hours 53 minutes]**\n“This is a drug that helps control abilities. They often give it to young awakeners who struggle with control.”\n“…Ability control?”\n**[393 hours 52 minutes]**\nI check the time.\nNot much has passed.\n“How does it taste?”\n“It’s good.”\n**[393 hours 52 minutes]**\nTime isn’t decreasing.\nI can speak freely now.\nAmazing.\nThe doctor is amazing.\nI fall silent.\nI just drink my beverage without saying anything.\nWhat should I say?\nI’m happy right now.\nBut thinking about what the doctor did, I can’t help but feel he’s the source of all my problems.\nIn other words, I should kill the doctor.\nThe doctor…\nI tried to conjure a knife but couldn’t.\nIs it because of this ability control?\nIt’s a scary drug.\nIf they secretly gave it to anyone, would they lose their abilities and suffer?\nIs there really such a universal drug?\nWell, to be honest, I don’t feel like killing him that much.\nIt feels like I just have to do it out of obligation.\n“Why…”\n“Hmm?”\n“Why did you come now?”\nI wonder why the doctor appeared.\n“Why do you dislike me?”\nThere are many questions to ask.\nI take another sip of my drink.\n“Hmm?”\nHe does dislike me.\nThere’s no way he could have made me like this otherwise.\nThere must be a reason.\n“I like you, doctor.”\nThe drug seems to work well.\nIt allows me to say things I could never say normally.\nI feel pretty good.\nThe doctor doesn’t respond.\n“…Ah.”\nIt seems the doctor realizes something.\nHe takes the cup filled with orange juice.\n“Haha, oh my.”\nHe smells it and laughs.\nIs something wrong?\n“I gave you the wrong drink. This is… alcohol.”\n“Alcohol?”\nI’ve already drunk more than half of it.\nNo wonder it tasted a bit different.“I didn’t intend for a minor to drink it.”\n“Eh.”\nThe drug is okay, but alcohol is not?\nWhat kind of nonsense is that?\n“Hahaha.”\nThat’s funny.\nWhat a funny joke.\n**[393 hours 51 minutes]**\nIt’s alcohol.\nIt doesn’t seem to affect time too much.\n“So, what’s the reason? Why do you dislike me, doctor?”\nI can’t quite see the doctor’s expression.\nIt’s as if there’s a filter over it, like mist or shadow.\nIt’s always been like this.\nIs this also a form of brainwashing or suggestion?\n“It hurts a bit when using drugs there.”\nShould I go closer and observe his expression?\nI’m not drunk.\nThere’s no way I am.\nI stand up and move.\nI walk over to the sofa where the doctor is sitting, across the table.\nI wobble slightly.\n“You purposely ordered a weak drug, didn’t you?”\nThe drugs used in the lab are all strange.\nSome work too well, while others are too weak.\nThere have been times when they just left me alone after the effect had worn off.\n“Or maybe not.”\nI sit down beside the doctor.\nThe sofa is soft.\n“I thought you were a good person, doctor. Why do you…”\nI’m just talking nonsense.\n“I don’t dislike you. I like you.”\nHe pets my head.\n“…Huh?”\nOh, he likes me?\nI can’t follow the flow of the conversation.\nI don’t even know what I’m saying.\nIt feels like it’s been ages since I heard someone say they liked me.\nWhen was the last time?\nI really don’t know.\nNo one has told me they liked me.\n“Um…”\nEven if it’s just a compliment, it feels nice.\nMy mood has improved.\nIt seems like that’s a thing.\nA lack of affection, maybe. I easily fall for kind words.\nIt’s probably because I don’t have parents or friends.\n“It’s better to talk when sober. I didn’t expect there to be alcohol in the orange juice bottle.”\nWhat a big deal.\nI feel really good.\nI think I can forget all the bad things that happened with the doctor.\nDid my brain break?\n“Aha.”\nIt broke long ago.\nI’m satisfied with just being like this.\nThere doesn’t seem to be a big problem, right?\nOr is there?\n**[393 hours 46 minutes]**\nTime seems abundant.\nIn fact, I can’t feel bad at all.\nI’m happy.\n“My hair has grown longer.”\n“Indeed.”\n“Oh, right. And my eyes seem a bit strange.”\nI push my hair aside to show my eyes.\nThe pupil in my right eye looked odd.\nIt was vertical.\n“And my body doesn’t move well, and when I speak, something feels off…”\nThere are too many strange things.\n“I see strange things and hear odd sounds, and my thoughts are jumbled, and my memories feel odd…”\nSomething is very wrong.\nWhat should I do?\nCould I survive if I went to the hospital for treatment?\nI think Researcher A had similar thoughts.\nThere’s a doctor in the hospital.\nThe doctor is right next to me.\n“I don’t know anything except how to use drugs anymore…”\nWhat should I do?\n“It’s probably too late for treatment.”\nI feel like I’m still asking about treatment.\n“It’s not too late.”\n“Really?”\n“There’s nothing to worry about.”\nHow does he plan to treat me?\nIs there a way?\n“Is that really so?”\nI don’t know if I can believe it.\nLast time, he said it was a treatment drug, but nothing got better.\nI just wanted to use more of it.\nIs it an unknown thing?\nIf I keep using it, maybe it really will heal.\nDid I not use enough?\n“…What would be good?”\nThe doctor checks something on his phone.\n“Which one?”\n“Could you call out a number? Something random.”\n“A number?”\n**[393 hours 45 minutes]**\n“45?”\n“Oh, yes. Then…”\n“Hmm?”\nWhat about it?\n“I’m thinking of sending a message.”\nTo whom?\n“I’m going to contact someone who can treat Seo Ah, so I need to tell them about your condition.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“The beneficiary who owes Seo Ah. They said they would treat you.”\n“A debt…”\nWhat kind of debt?\nI mostly remember being trapped in the lab, so I can’t recall much.\n“At the very least, they should be able to remove those scars completely.”\n“Ah.”\nThat’s a relief.\nI didn’t want to show the scars when I met my friend.\nA friend, huh?\nMy memories are vague.\nWhat happened back then?\nI know Han Shihu really hated me.\nI felt like I was going to die.\nMaybe it was a dream.\n**[393 hours 31 minutes]**\nTime has passed a bit more.\nIt feels good to be able to stay leisurely in the café.\nAnd it feels even better knowing I can be treated for my pain.\n“Are you looking forward to it?”\n“Yes.”\nI feel like we’ve gotten a bit closer.\n“Can I have some more juice?”\n“Oh, that’s it for now.”\n“Ah…”\nThe doctor pushes the cup aside.\nI thought I could drink just a little more.\n“Can I lie down?”\n“Yes.”\nWow.\n“A pillow for my knees… hee.”\nThe sofa is long enough for me to lie down.\nMy head feels dizzy, so I just lie back.\nIs it because of the alcohol?\nMy head feels oddly hot too.\n“You can sleep if you want.”\n“…I don’t want to.”\nI can’t just close my eyes anywhere.\nIf I wake up and find myself back in the lab, it wouldn’t be surprising.\nI don’t know where they would send me, soaking in drugs.\nMy vision starts to distort.\nI’m confused about where I’m lying.\nAm I really lying on the sofa, or was I placed on the experimental table?\nI’m confused about who’s with me.\nIt must be a friend.\nIs it Shihu?\nWas the doctor Shihu?\nNo.\nYeah.\nIs he a researcher?\nMaybe I’m still trapped in the lab and just lost in a delusion.\nMy vision isn’t functioning properly.\n“Aha.”\nI feel good, but it’s strange.\nMy mind feels hazy.\nI smile brightly.\n**[393 hours 20 minutes]**\n***\nAn outing with a friend.\nIt’s my first outing with\na friend.\nA friend who gave me a name instead of just calling me the saint.\nHan Shihu.\nIt’s an outing just for the two of us.\nOf course, it’s not just to hang out.\nThanks to the previous escape from the research facility, we discovered the corruption of the military factory.\nIf the saint is connected to both the lab and the factory, she could be a great help to Shihu.\n“This should be fine; they won’t see it as strange.”\nI fix my clothes while looking in the mirror.\nI have several outfits I didn’t even buy.\nWhite clothes that go well with my long white hair.\nThey’re as white as the saint’s feeling.\nAm I too conspicuous?\nYeah, maybe something else would be better.\nAs I try on various outfits, I realize the meeting time is approaching.\n“Okay. Let’s just… go with this.”\nA gray hoodie.\nI decided on a casual outfit.\nIt’s not good to be too conspicuous.\nI step out onto the street.\nNo one seems to be looking at me.\nIt must be a suitable outfit choice.\nAfter leaving my house, I arrive at the café.\nShihu will be here soon.\n“Can I have a café latte, please?”\nI order something first.\n-Ding.\nA message arrives.\nI go to the seat I reserved and sit down.\nI prepare to read, hoping it’s from Shihu.\nWhat arrives is a strange link.\nI don’t know who sent it, so I feel uneasy.\n“Is it a spam message?”\nI’ve heard not to open things like this carelessly.\n-Ding.\nAnother message arrives.\nThis time it’s a photo.\nA girl with a bright smile.\nI recognize the white lab coat.\nWhat was her name again?\nSeo Ah?\nI remember the promise we made in the past.\n-So, if you stay in the lab for just a month… they’ll heal everything?\n-Yes. I already saved you from dying, right? Even severe drug addiction can be cured.\n-I’ll do it.\n-Good choice. It’ll hurt a bit, but I’ve heard you’re immune to the drug? You just have to hold on for a month.\n-Okay.\nI remember the state back then.\nThere’s no way I could last more than a month.\nI thought I would have died long ago.\nI think about who sent the message.\nAre they planning to threaten me?\nWho would do something like this…\nHesitating, I click the link.\nA video starts to play.\nA surveillance video that’s 45 minutes long.\nLooking at the date on the screen, it’s from six months ago.\nA girl sitting in a chair is captured.\n“-Ah, you were already here.”\nJust then, Shihu enters the café.\nI quickly turn off my phone.\nI’ll watch the video later.\nA video sent by someone I don’t even know what they want.\n“Ah, hello, Shihu.”\nOn a day like today, it’s nothing but a distraction.",

      "content": "A long, long day has come to an end.\nJust being with Shihu was nice.\nThere weren’t any special gains, but it felt like we had grown closer.\nI felt really good.\nDing.\nThat was before the message arrived.\nI don’t know who is messing around with my annoying past.\nIt’s a past I’ve forgotten.\nIt’s all over.\nI still haven’t watched the video.\nThere’s no need to.\nNo matter what happens to her, it’s not my fault.\nI tried my best to keep my promise.\nI did everything I could to get her out of the lab, but I just failed.\nIt’s not my responsibility.\nI know I’m not living up to the name of the saint.\nBut that’s just because of my white hair and the treatment I received, which earned me that title.\nIt doesn’t mean anything.\n“…Ugh…”\nIt’s annoying.\nThis is why I hate meeting people.\nIt’s really bothersome to get pestering texts too.\nI don’t understand why someone is doing this.\nStill, I guess I need to check.\nWhat could the message be?\nThis time it’s a photo instead of a link.\n“A photo of Shihu…?”\nIt shows two people in academy uniforms.\nShihu and a girl wearing an eye patch beside him.\nThey’re captured in a photo, eating together.\n“…Huh?”\nI play the video.\nIt shows a girl sitting in a chair.\nIt’s the same person.\nIn fact, I didn’t need to confirm the video.\nShe looks just like the girl in my memories.\nI just want to deny it with all my might.\nI think if I deny it hard enough, it will disappear.\n“Why is she with Shihu…?”\nIt’s been about two months since I met Shihu.\nHonestly, we’re not that close.\nWe’re definitely not close enough to dig into the past.\nWe had just started to get to know each other.\nDing.\n- Shihu is friends with Seo Ah.\n“Friends?”\nI send a reply.\n-Who are you?\nWho could it be?\nSomeone who would do something like this.\nWhy are they bringing this up now after so long?\nHow do they know about Shihu’s past?\nI hate it.\nI don’t even want to think about old times.\nStill, there are things that need to be confronted head-on.\nAvoiding everything won’t solve anything.\n“Yeah, I could just… watch the video.”\nI really don’t want to see it.\nThe video was recorded six months ago.\nIt’s a miracle that she was still alive back then.\nShe should have died long ago.\nEspecially since it’s related to Shihu, it makes things even worse.\nMy head feels confused.\nThe thing I hate most is bringing up the past.\nI see the girl sitting in the chair, Seo Ah.\nThere’s a single chair in an empty room.\nIt doesn’t look like a place where experiments are conducted.\n“There’s no sound.”\nBeing a surveillance camera, that’s a given.\nI should at least be thankful that it’s a video with color.\nAfter a moment, a person who looks like a researcher comes in.\nThe researcher gestures for her to follow.Seo Ah follows him.\nAnd then she disappears from the screen.\nNothing but the chair is visible.\nI feel an inexplicable anxiety.\n“What’s going on…”\nThe camera angle is awkward.\nIt doesn’t show the whole room, which is frustrating.\nSomething is happening out of the frame.\nThere’s blood splattered.\nFrom the direction the researcher took Seo Ah.\nAnd it stays that way.\nIt takes about three minutes of video playback before something changes.\nIt seems someone is walking back.\nA shadow of a person appears.\nSeo Ah comes back into view.\nCovering one eye with her hand, she stumbles as she looks for the chair.\n“Uh…”\nAfter feeling around, she finds the chair.\nShe struggles to sit down because the chair is positioned awkwardly.\nWith her head lowered, she sits down.\nAnd then nothing happens.\nI can’t tell what has happened to her.\nThey must have sent this video on purpose.\nBut why?\n“Ha…”\nDid she injure her eyes?\nThat’s unfortunate.\nSo what?\nWhat am I supposed to do?\nIt’s all in the past.\nI could just bury it.\n- But are you that desperate? The drug you took was your choice, wasn’t it?\nA conversation I had with Seo Ah comes to mind.\n- No. Choice? No, it was, but… no.\nI said it while laughing.\nThe Seo Ah in the video is also smiling.\nEven with her eyes covered, she’s smiling.\nWhy?\nWhy is she smiling?\n- So, what will you do when you’re healed?\n- I’ll play with my friends.\nShe smiled again.\nI wondered who that friend was, was it Shihu?\nIt must be.\nI don’t understand.\nWhat did Shihu like about being friends with this drug addict?\nDamn it.\nDamn it.\nDamn it.\nDamn it.\nThud.\nA needle pierces my arm.\nI feel at ease.\nI calm down a bit.\nIn truth, I can’t really criticize her for being a drug addict.\nI use it sometimes too.\nAh, right.\nWe do resemble each other.\nThat girl Seo Ah and I.\nI’m grateful she’s there.\nIf she weren’t, I might have been in that position.\nMy mind clears.\nI feel more relaxed.\n“Hmm. That’s a strange hairstyle.”\nIs it just slightly longer than a bob cut?\nWell, considering it’s a lab, I guess they can’t maintain their hair properly...\n“Does Shihu like bobs?”\nMaybe my hair has grown too long.\nNext time, I should change my style.\nThe video is still playing.\nBut I don’t care.\nWhether blood is smeared around her eyes or she coughs up cigarette butts,\nI don’t care.\nAfter all, she probably died by now.\nIf it comes to it, I’ll take care of everything.\nWith Shihu, I’ll be more useful than her.\nThere’s no way anything would change from a video like this.\nI have a rough idea of who sent it.\nShihu was friends with her.\nWell, that could be useful somehow.\n-I’ll contact you later.\nIt’s a message from Shihu.\n- If you find out anything or if anything happens, let me know.\nLooking at the message, it’s a very businesslike attitude.\nBut things will change now.\nI think I might not be able to forget Seo Ah.\nIf that’s the case, I’ll go find her together.\nThat’s it.\nI can just go find her together.\nI can say I’ll help her.\nShould I just send the video to Shihu?\nWe’ll look for Seo Ah together.\nEven if we can’t find her, we’ll stick together during the search.\nIf it’s confirmed she’s dead… well, that’s unfortunate.\nThen I can comfort Shihu and we can grow closer.\nIt’s a perfect plan.\nI don’t attend the academy, so I don’t know the details.\nI don’t know how things have turned out.\nI want to hear about the past.\nNo, I have to.\nHow?\nThere are clearly parts where they avoid mentioning the past.\nShould I just ask casually, as if I noticed something with the saint’s abilities?\nYeah, I was too hasty.\nIf I ask how Shihu knew about Seo Ah’s connection, it would be hard to answer.\nAnd asking how she knew Seo Ah would be the same.\nHmm.\nIf I think carefully, I might come up with an answer.\nWill they not send me more videos?\nNo, to be honest, I didn’t intend to use this against her.\nI meant to save her.\nThey told me to hold on for a month.\nThat they could cure even severe drug addiction.\nBut I didn’t know where she was.\nI’ve searched all the labs I know.\nSince I didn’t find her, I thought she was dead.\n“…Could she still be alive?”\nIf that’s the case, she really is resilient.\nWell, experiments are experiments.\nThey might not have pushed her to death.\n“Hmm…”\nWhat if Seo Ah meets Shihu while still alive?\nThat might be tricky.\nIt would be direct evidence that I’m involved.\n“No way.”\nThe video is from six months ago.\nEven if she’s not dead, there’s no way she’d be sane.\nMy mind is spinning.\n“…Ha, ha. This is so annoying.”\nI still can’t figure it out.\nWhy was Shihu friends with a drug addict like her?\nI don’t understand.\nHmm.\nShould I change my hairstyle first?\nInto a bob.\nGood.\nI’ll make it as similar to Seo Ah as possible—no, but if it’s too obvious, wouldn’t they notice?\nLet’s cut it to a moderate length.\nAnd while I’m at it, I’ll bring up Seo Ah’s story naturally.\nShihu has a lot of girls around him.\nBut it doesn’t seem like he has any special feelings for them.\nWas it because of Seo Ah?\nWhat could the sender of the message be thinking?\nAre they trying to make me feel guilty?\nOf course,\nit’s sad.\nBut there’s nothing I can do about it.\n“Should I just ask on the phone?”\nLet’s do that.\nRing.\nI dial the number that sent the message.\nI think to myself why I didn’t think of this sooner.\nI should have done this much earlier.\nAh.\nThey picked up.\n“Hello?”\n<Yes.>\nA girl’s voice?\n“Who are you to send me this?”\n<Ah, is this the saint?>\n“What’s that supposed to mean?”\n<Well, can you please help Seo Ah?>\n“Huh?”\n<She must still be trapped in the lab.>\n“Who are you, and why should I…?”\nBut wait, is this someone I can trust?\nThey seem to know everything and sent videos and photos.\nMaybe it could be a good opportunity.\n<Seo Ah is probably just waiting for you.>\nThe voice is oddly flat.\nWho could this be?\nIt could just be voice modulation or something.\n“…Where do I need to go?”\n<I sent you the address.>\n“Okay, but… Ha… is she really alive?”\n<Yes. So please save her.>\n“I got it. I’ll do my best… but where did you get the videos and photos? Do you have more?”\n<Oh, I can send you more if you’d like.>\n“You’re… an insider from the facility, aren’t you?”\n<Something like that, yes.>\nI don’t know who it is.\nBut they’re probably trying to capture me.\nThe title of the saint is really easy to target.\nBut if I’m with Shihu, wouldn’t it be okay?\nThat’s what I think.\nEven if I get caught, wouldn’t Shihu find a way to save me?\n“Okay. I understand. I just have to go save her.”\nIt’s amusing.\nI can’t help but smile.\n<Yes.>\nThe call ends.\nDid they laugh?\nI don’t know what they’re doing, but it’s entertaining.\nAnyway, it’s good.\nNow I have a solid reason to get involved with Shihu.\nIs this some kind of trap?\nIt could be.\nAre they trying to capture me?\nDing.\nA text arrives with the address.\nI need to go outside the city.\nIt’s quite a distance.\nWell, that’s good.\nI feel happy that I might get to travel with Shihu.\nWill another opportunity like this come again?\nEven if it’s true that Seo Ah is alive, I guess I can figure that part out.\nAh, my mood has improved a bit.\nIt’s been about two weeks since I last used the drug.\nIt felt good to use it after such a long time.\n“Hmm… what should I say to Shihu?”\nLet me think.\nI need a good excuse.\n“I’ll just say I found some documents while I was raiding a government facility? That sounds good. Yeah.”\nLet’s go with that.\n“I heard there’s a girl who looks like your friend… and then… hmm… yeah. That sounds good.”\nI want to stick with Shihu for as long as possible.\nIt’s too hasty to just go straight to the address.\nHmm.\nAs I think about it more, I come up with a plausible plan.\n“Yeah. Sounds good.”\nPerfect.",

Please…”\nThe needle goes in again.\n[955 hours 46 minutes]\nThis sensation of awakening in every nerve cell.\nIt’s not enough.\nStill not enough.\nBecause the drugs are everywhere.\nI’m going to use them all.\nAh, I remembered.\nWhy I need to use all the drugs.\nThere’s a reason I have to do it.\nSo it was this room.\nThe study.\nWhere the doctor reads complicated medical books.\nI’m just lying on the carpeted floor.\nIn the bookshelf in the study, there’s a secret compartment.\n“Haah…”\nIf you push the bookshelf, there’s a space inside.\nA space filled with lots of drugs.\nI have to use them all.\nI will use them all.\n- There are a lot of drugs.\n- Yes, I’m planning to distribute them to the people here.\n- Distribute them?\nI don’t understand why they want to give out the drugs.\nI really don’t get it.\n- Yes. It’s not the right time yet, but...\n- Why?\nWhy are they trying to scatter drugs?\nIf they’re talking about people from the slums where the factory is located,\nare they going to give it to kids like Yula or Hyun?\nWhy?\nThat shouldn’t happen.\n- Happiness grows the more you share it.\nWhat the hell are you talking about?\nI can be perfectly happy with just myself.\n- Why?\n- Of course, the people living here are not awakeners, but if they use the drugs, just for a moment…\n- No.\nI grab the doctor and speak.\n- I’m going to use all the drugs myself.\nSo that’s how I ended up like this.\nHow much have I used?\n100 doses?\nNo, maybe not that much.\nIf I keep going, won’t the stock eventually run out?\nI can’t let anyone else use the drugs.\nI won’t create more addicts.\nThat’s how it has to be.\nThinking back, the doctor didn’t charge for the first drugs he gave me.\nIt was free.\nHe probably distributed them to many others besides me.\nSo I...\n“Haah.”\nDrugs.\nDrugs.\n“More...”\nI have to use everything.\nEverything, even the portion for others.\n- Thud.\n“Ugh.”\n[958 hours 24 minutes]\nI’m so euphoric right now.\nI feel like I’m losing it.\nThat means I have no future.\nBut even without drugs, there was no future.\nSo it’s better to use all the drugs and leave.\nThat’s the best choice.\n[958 hours 23 minutes]\nTo be honest, I don’t really care about that; I just want more drugs.\nIf I can stimulate the pleasure center, that’s all I need.\nAs long as the reward circuit keeps running, I’ll be fine.\nJust using drugs is all that matters in the world.\nIt’s a relatively vast world.\nJust a prick and I’m happy.\nIt’s something on a different level than the typical pleasure one can obtain.\nThud. Then pleasure.\nIt’s joyful.\nI’m happy.\nI’m blissful.\nThud. Then pleasure.\nIt’s joyful.\nI’m happy.\nI’m blissful.\nAn infinite loop.\nWhile the pleasure licks my body, nothing else comes to mind.\nNormal reasoning doesn’t apply.\nEthics and morals crumble.\nAs long as I feel good, that’s all that matters.\nSomeone once said,\nthe ultimate goal of life is happiness.\nSo maybe I have already achieved my goal.\n“Ehehe…”\nHonestly, saying I won’t let anyone else use drugs is an excuse.\nIf I really thought that, I would have used my abilities to smash the syringes and the vials.\nSo what?\nIf I’m going to break them anyway, it’s better to use as much as I can before smashing them.\nI should conserve resources.\nThat’s the obvious thing to do.\nBut why is the doctor giving me so many drugs?\nHe used to sell them for money.\nI hope they’re not all on credit when I check later.\n“More…”\nThey give me everything I ask for.\nThere’s nothing I demand besides the drugs.\n“Let’s stop here for today.”\nThud.\nThe doctor closes the book.\nHe doesn’t seem like he’s going to give me any drugs.\n[970 hours 39 minutes]\nWhy?\nI can’t stop here.\n“Drugs…”\n“Can you get up?”\nI’m completely relaxed.\nBut getting up should be doable.\n“[I’ll get up...]”\nI pushed myself up with my arm against the wall.\nSomehow, I can do it.\n“I’m up, so the drugs...”\nGive me more.\nIt’s already too late to stop.\nIf a vehicle running at 500 kilometers per hour comes to a sudden stop, the passengers inside could get hurt.\nI think it’s not so easy to just cut off the drugs.\n970 hours is a lot, but still.\n“More...”\nI need more.\n---\nI need more information.\nI want to know when Seo Ah became friends with Shihu.\nAnd why they’re friends.\nSo I investigated.\nI don’t only know Shihu at the academy.\nThere are many people who have benefited from the 'saint.'\nSome of them are academy students.\nThere’s no problem with extracting information from them.\nBut even that was so difficult that I had almost no information.\nI think she might have briefly attended at some point, but there’s no one I know or have seen.\nNo one claiming to be in the same class.\nIn the photo, they were in uniforms.\nAcademy uniforms.\nWhile I doubted it was a manipulated photo, I eventually found someone who knew Seo Ah.\nAt least someone who had met her.\n“Seol Hanjin?”\n“Ah, is that you, Saint?”\nHer striking white hair stands out.\nShe’s good\n-looking, but not as good as Shihu, and has a somewhat delinquent-looking gaze.\n“What... It’s been a while.”\nIt’s a café near the academy.\nThere aren’t many people around.\n“So you’re looking for that girl Seo Ah?”\n“Yeah, kind of.”\n“First off, she’s not at the academy right now. I looked into it because it seemed really odd, but it seems like the academy is hiding her on purpose.”\n“Tell me everything you found out with your surveillance abilities. Then I can help with your treatment.”\nIt’s a deal.\nIn exchange for information about Seo Ah, I offer treatment.\nMy healing ability isn’t perfect, but it’s much closer to being effective than an average awakener’s.\n“Yeah, well. Seo Ah and Shihu, both come from the slums. One of them is an ace without question. The other is a lunatic.”\nThat’s harsh.\n“A lunatic?”\n“Must be, right? She had that typical middle school syndrome, running around with an eye patch. She was cute, but maybe that’s why Shihu liked her.”\n“Liked? Shihu liked her?”\nDid he like her?\nWere they that close?\n“I don’t know if it was in the past, but it seemed like Shihu was protective of her. Later, he threatened that he’d kill anyone who tried to mess with her.”\n“Hmm.”\nThat’s a new side of him.\nI’ve never seen Shihu get so angry.\n“Anything else you know… she went to some special class? Or something like that, and she disappeared one day. That’s about it. Once Shihu threatened to kill anyone who tried to monitor or touch her, it was too scary to do anything.”\n“I guess he felt he had done something wrong.”\n“I was just trying to look out for my junior, but it was misunderstood… Oh, speaking of.”\nSomething seems to come to mind.\n“What else do you know?”\n“Yeah. When she came in, I heard she was stabbed. There was a witness. Wasn’t it a staff member? It was someone responsible for transporting victims who told me.”\n“Stabbed? What’s that about...?”\n“I don’t know either. That’s all I know. But why are you so curious? You seem to know a bit more than you let on.”\n“Well, just.”\nIt’s for personal reasons.\nNo need to pry.\n“So who is this person asking for treatment?”\n“It’s the teacher’s sister.”\n“Eh?”\nThat’s an unusual choice.\nIs there some backstory?\n“There’s a teacher named Lee Yuram, and I heard her sister’s condition isn’t good. I thought it wouldn’t be a bad idea to treat her while I have the chance.”\n“Hmm, well. Yeah. So where is that sister?”\n“Ah… that’s the thing.”\nHe hesitates.\n“I can’t treat her if I don’t know where she is. If she comes to me, I don’t care.”\n“I think Shihu has her…”\n“......What?”\nI need to treat the teacher’s sister, but Shihu has her.\nI see.\n“Shihu has her?”\nWhy would Shihu have her?\nI don’t understand what that means.",

      "content": "“Why is Shihu taking her? Are they close? Did she go over to his house?”\nI still don’t understand.\nShihu wouldn’t be living with another girl.\nIt’s strange.\n“Uh... if I had to pinpoint it, it might be a kidnapping?”\n“Uh?”\n“Honestly, no one would believe me if I told them... Even if I went directly to Teacher Lee Yuram, she would completely deny her sister’s existence.”\nWhat are you talking about?\n“…It isn’t her sister?”\n“No, I confirmed it with my ability. I haven’t told anyone, but it’s clear that Shihu is involved in kidnapping and confinement... even intimidation.”\n“Why...?”\nI still don’t get it.\nSeol Hanjin, is your head messed up or something?\nOr am I the one who’s weird?\nKidnapping, confinement, intimidation?\n“I can see you’re struggling to believe it. But since you seem to be interested in Shihu, I’m telling you.”\n“No, Shihu lives in the dormitory. In the first place...”\nLet’s accept the reasoning.\nFine.\nWhere is he supposedly kidnapping and confining her?\n“That guy... seems to have some kind of space travel skill. It looks like he has plenty of hidden locations and residences.”\n“Surely the people around him wouldn’t be unaware. If he’s causing such a major incident.”\n“I don’t think the people around Shihu are entirely ignorant. He might have accomplices...”\nWhat are you saying?\nWhat on earth are you talking about?\n“So, what’s wrong with that teacher’s sister?”\n“I’m not sure. I just know she’s sick. The only thing I know is that Shihu is using that to hold something over Teacher Lee Yuram.”\nEverything he says is just strange.\n“So what do you want me to do? Are you close to that sister? Is that why?”\n“No, I’ve never met her.”\nSeol Hanjin answers nonchalantly.\n“Are you trying to mess with me?”\n“Check it out. It’s the truth. The promise to treat her, a promise is a promise, right?”\n“What...?”\n“It’s true. Shihu is a bad guy.”\nHe seems to dislike Shihu.\n“Impossible.”\n“The perception is that he’s a good person, but that Seo Ah from earlier and the way he behaves is odd.”\n“......”\n“Wow, I haven’t had anyone to talk to about this. Shihu is a frightening guy.”\nIsn’t that a conspiracy theory level of slander?\nIt’s easier to believe he just dislikes Shihu and is making up stories.\nI’m going crazy.\n“No, I just don’t understand the kidnapping and confinement...”\nI’m confused about what I’m even hearing.\nIsn’t it this guy who should be getting treatment?\n“I didn’t ask him directly because I thought he’d kill me, but please check with the saint. If there’s no kidnapping or anything similar... then it’s all good.”\nHe says this in a serious tone.\nStill, it’s a strange story.\n“Really.”\nHe opens his mouth again.\nThis time, his playful tone is gone.\n“Shihu is not normal.”\nHe must have had more dealings with him than I have.\nIt’s new for someone to be hostile towards Shihu.\nIt’s unusual for someone to say he’s not normal.\nI don’t know Shihu well.\nWe haven’t become truly close yet.\n“Fine. I’ll check about the kidnapping and that kind of stuff.”\nKidnapping, confinement, and intimidation of the teacher’s sister?\nShihu is doing that?\nThat doesn’t match his image.\nHe seems kind, good, and righteous.\nIs he in the same department as me?\nMany people think he’s good just because of the title of saint.\nBut Shihu is genuinely kind.\nIt doesn’t matter.\nI’ll get to know more as I go along.\nBut kidnapping and confinement is...\nThere must be some misunderstanding.\nThe most likely scenario is that Seol Hanjin is the one who’s lost it.\n---\nI returned home.\nThinking it over and over again feels strange.\nSomething has gotten tangled up.\nI intended to use Seo Ah to get close to Shihu.\nBut for some reason, the sister of a teacher whose name I didn’t even know popped up.\nKidnapping, confinement, intimidation.\nIt still feels strange no matter how many times I mull it over.\n“Why would Shihu do such a thing...”\nShould I doubt him?\nIf Seo Ah was a really close friend, why did she let him use drugs?\nIs there a darkness to Shihu that I don’t know about?\nThere are many strange people in the slums.\nBut I still like Shihu.\nSo I’m not going to give up.\n“I guess I need to get closer.”\nWhat’s the best way to get close to someone?\nTo do a favor?\nWhat if I rescue Seo Ah?\nThat would be a new approach.\nNo... Just providing some information about Seo Ah might increase our intimacy.\nI could prompt Shihu to bring it up.\nAnd after hearing about Seo Ah, I could say I’ll check into it.\nI’m not lacking in information either.\nDing.\nA text has arrived.\nThis time it’s a photo, not a video.\n“Wow...”\nIt looks broken.\nWas it taken right after the experiment?\nBut the subject is smiling, which makes it even stranger.\nIt’s good that I have more material to share with Shihu, but who is doing this?\nI have no idea who would pull something like this.\nWhy wouldn’t they send this picture or video straight to Shihu?\nThey must know I could bring Shihu into this.\nThey even emphasized that Seo Ah and Shihu are friends...\nI don’t understand the purpose.\nI really can’t figure it out.\nI’ve been trying to ignore it, but seriously, who are you?\nAh.\nIt hurts my head.\nWhy are they doing this to me?\nLast time I panicked and used drugs.\nNo matter how much I can heal myself, I should hold off on using drugs.\nI might do something nonsensical in my excitement.\n“…Using the drug feels good.”\nMaybe Seo Ah in that photo didn’t mind at all.\nAs long as they get drugs, there are tons of people willing to do anything.\n“Shihu is unfortunate. If his friend is in this state…”\nBut really, why are they friends?\nWhat did Shihu do to have Seo Ah in that condition?\nShihu is someone who has the conviction to protect his friends.\nWhen I first met Seo Ah, it didn’t seem like he had a friend.\nDid Shihu discard her?\nNo, that’s strange too.\n“Shihu... should I just ask him directly?”\nMy head is too muddled.\nI’m filled with unrealistic stories.\n“What if...?”\nWhat’s the worst-case scenario?\n“If Shihu really is a piece of trash who discarded his friends from the slums and is now kidnapping and holding the teacher’s family hostage.”\nWhy would he do such a thing?\nBut what if, just hypothetically.\n“Then mentioning Seo Ah could have a counterproductive effect...?”\nI need to know what happened between them.\nWithout that knowledge, all this mess will continue.\n“Still, I thought we were a bit close, but I guess not.”\nNo matter how close you are, it’s hard to say something like, “I have a friend like Seo Ah.”\nI only have hearsay to work with.\nIf I want to ascertain the truth...\nAh, right.\nThere’s no need for me to leak information about Seo Ah.\nPretending to be an anonymous person, I could pass on information about Seo Ah and see how he reacts?\nThat’s good, right?\nLet’s put it into action.\n---\n***\nTaking back the number one ranking.\nShihu officially became number one after ending the tyranny of Cheon Yuhwa.\nThe ranking list hanging on the bulletin board.\nAlthough I can check the rankings on my device, it feels different to see them printed and posted like this.\nThe problem isn’t the ranking list.\nWhat’s posted on the bulletin board is a photo.\n“...Who did this...”\nIt’s a photo of Seo Ah eating with someone.\nThe reason it’s on the bulletin board is unknown.\nThere’s no one around but Shihu.\nThe photo was clearly posted to draw attention to Shihu.\nWith a soft thud, a thumbtack falls.\nThough it’s my first time seeing this photo, I can tell when it was taken.\nOn the back of the photo, something is written.\n“Come to the alley next to the bookstore outside the academy.

What about school?”\n“None.”\nI skipped it.\nAll of it.\n“Oh, I see. I came here to wait for you.”\n“Right.”\n“Are you busy with something?”\nI have.\nSurveillance.\n“I heard someone’s messing around.”\nThe ventilation fan located in the middle of the alley.\nThere’s a letter there that wasn’t there earlier.\n“Messing around?”\nThe saint has followed me.\n“They told me to come here, I wonder who it could be.”\nI rip open the newly discovered letter.\nThe name of the recipient is Shihu.\nInside is another photo.\nIt’s a photo of Shihu staring at the camera.\nAnd he remained silent for a while.\n“…What the...”\nIt’s a picture of Seo Ah smiling.\nIt looks like she’s lying on the floor.\nThere are several empty syringes scattered next to her.\nSomeone is stepping on Seo Ah’s stomach.\nIt seems they took the photo while stepping on her.\nThe one being stepped on looks perfectly fine.\nIn any case, she’s smiling happily.\n“......”\nIs that Seo Ah...?\nWho took this photo and when?\nWhy?\nIs it a manipulated photo?\nNo, it doesn’t matter.\nI can just ask the target who pulled this stunt.\nAnd fortunately, I have the saint right next to me.\nShould I step on her?\nI wonder if I need to frame it in the same angle as the photo.",

      "content": "Seo Ah… is she still alive?\nIs there any chance of returning to a normal life with her?\nShihu is not bad at studying.\nHe clearly understood what was taught at school, and what he learned is that possibilities always exist.\nThrowing a coin ten times and getting heads every time.\nIt’s possible.\nEven if you increase the number of tosses to a hundred, it’s still possible.\nWhat if you throw it a thousand times?\nPossible.\nWhat about ten thousand?\nStill possible.\nThe probability of getting heads every single time—even after tens of millions, hundreds of millions of tosses—is always present.\nEven if it's close to zero, it's still not zero.\nIn some ways, miracles are not miracles.\nIt’s just that the probability is incredibly low.\nSo, theoretically,\nTheoretically, Seo Ah is still alive.\nOr, she could be alive.\nIf the probability is low, one could somehow increase it using abilities.\nThe very existence of Awakened individuals is already miraculous.\nSo hope always exists.\n*Bang.*\nDid the doctor shoot a real gun?\nDid Seo Ah get shot?\nWas there a possibility that everything was a hologram?\nNeither the doctor nor Seo Ah was found in the collapsed building.\nThen, could she really be alive?\nIt was only after the purification penalty disappeared that such a thought crossed my mind.\nIt’s just a theory.\nThe problem is, I can’t be sure whether her survival would actually be a good thing.\nI wonder if something like what was shown in the picture really happened.\nIs the photo real or fake?\nIf it’s real, when and who took it?\nAnd why did someone decide to show it to me?\nBut still, it’s better that Seo Ah is alive than dead.\nA million times better.\nSo, I hope the photo is fake, but at the same time, I wish it were real.\nBut even if the photo is real…\nI still don’t know if Seo Ah is alive.\n“I think I get it.”\nWho could be the one messing around?\nThe Saintess.\nI have no idea why she would do such a thing.\n“Hmm?”\nThe Saintess looks at me, seemingly confused.\nShe’s acting.\nBut it’s too clumsy.\nIs she surprised because my reaction isn’t what she expected?\nShihu thinks of the best course of action.\nHe wonders how far he should let the Saintess fool him.\n“Shihu, what’s the photo about?”\nI calm my desire to ask if she really doesn’t know.\nWhat’s the best way to approach this?\nWhere should I go to extract information from the Saintess?\n“Yeah, what is this about?”\nMy voice trembles slightly, but it’s inevitable.\nI’m angry.\nMy childhood friend is being trampled and laughing, but I want to interrogate the Saintess right away.\nThe Saintess still stands there, acting like she knows nothing.\nShihu keeps thinking.\nHe arrives at a conclusion.\n“What’s going on?”\n“…It’s not really the place to talk about this.”\nThe alley is too exposed.\nAnd it’s awkward to talk here.\nSo where should we go?\nThe academy is no good since the Saintess isn’t a student.\nA bookstore might have people watching.\n“Hmm, then?”\nLet’s go to the Saintess’s house.\n“To your place?”\n“My place?”\nTo the place full of information.In fact, even if she refuses, I plan to enter eventually.\n“Uh… Um, well, it’s a bit messy. But, yeah, okay. We’re going now? It’s a bit far.”\n“Yeah.”\nWhere does the Saintess live, anyway?\n---\n### **At the outskirts of the city, a house has been secured.**\nIt’s an area that failed during a past new city development.\nIt’s almost uninhabited.\nIf we go about ten blocks further, it won’t even be considered part of the city anymore.\nI never thought I’d end up at the house with Shihu.\nEspecially today.\nBefore I knew it, we were in front of the house.\n“Uh, wait a minute. I’ll clean up first.”\nThe house needs some cleaning.\n“Okay.”\nWow.\nShihu’s at the house.\nShihu’s here.\nI unlock the door and go inside.\nIt’s clean.\nBut there are things that are hard to show.\nLike syringes, for example.\n*Click.*\nThe door doesn’t close.\nI turn around and see Shihu holding the doorknob.\n“Shihu?”\n“……”\nIt seems like he has something to say.\n“Sh-Shihu, what’s wrong?”\n“It’s nothing, I just wanted to say something.”\n“Hmm?”\nI’m feeling uneasy.\nSomething feels wrong.\n*Bang.*\nThe door slams against the wall.\nShihu opened it all the way.\n“So, where did you get this photo from?”\nHuh?\nThe photo I found earlier?\nIs he asking me?\nWhere did I get it from?\n“Huh?”\nWhat did Shihu just say?\nMy mind freezes.\n“I know you’re behind this.”\nHe knows?\nHow?\nShihu’s angry, and maybe it’s because of me.\nHe’s sure of it.\nWould he believe me if I denied it?\n“Why…?”\n“The reason is what I want to ask.”\n“…It’s just that there’s some misunderstanding.”\n“Yeah. If you’re going to act like that, then…”\nShihu steps a little closer.\n“Ah, uh.”\nI’ve been caught.\nBut I don’t know where I’ve been caught.\nI suddenly remember what Seol Haejin said.\nShihu isn’t normal.\nI try to understand why he said that.\nThis isn’t the usual Shihu I know.\nHe’s intimidating.\n*Bang.*\nShihu grabs my shoulder.\n“Please, just tell me everything now.”\n“Ah…”\n“Please.”\nIt’s my fault.\nMaybe I should have just told him everything from the start.\nI’ll say it all.\nWhy didn’t I speak honestly earlier?\nBecause I could have been misunderstood as the one who put Seo Ah in the lab.\nEven if it wasn’t me, she would’ve been dragged somewhere anyway.“……”\nHow should I explain this?\nMy head feels fuzzy.\n“If you don’t say anything, I’ll find out on my own.”\n“W-What, I mean…”\nI just wanted to get closer to you.\nI thought maybe you wouldn’t open up.\nThinking about it, that was a really underhanded move.\nIt seems like it was.\nBut it’s strange to confess like this after getting this far.\n“Answer me.”\nI can’t speak.\nI really don’t know how I got caught.\nI have to say something.\nAnything.\n“So, uh, yeah. She’s already dead. She’s already dead, so…”\nI said she was dead.\nMy head is a mess, and I just blurted something out.\n“……”\nShe’s probably dead.\nIf she’s not, that’s even more of a problem.\n“Explain the photo. Who took it, where, why? How did you get it?”\nI don’t really know either.\n“It was from the government files when I raided them. I thought it was your friend, so I was too scared to just show it... I was curious about what kind of relationship you had…”\n“What are you saying?”\n“…Ah, I mean, it said your friend’s name in the file, but there’s no way your friend would be in a photo like that, so…”\n“What…”\nShihu doesn’t seem to understand either.\nThe lie is covering up the lie.\nThere’s a brief silence.\nShihu, who was about to enter the house, is standing still.\nIt’s not good if he comes in.\nI didn’t clean up the drugs last time.\nActually, it’s not just the drugs I didn’t clean up…\nI’m just naturally messy.\nThe house is just dirty.\nAh, why did I invite him?\nNo, Shihu must have come here with this in mind.\nHe’s suspicious of me.\nThat’s probably it.\n“Seo Ah is dead? What are you talking about?”\nShihu speaks again.\n“…The file said she was already dead.”\nIt’s a plausible excuse.\n“Where’s this file?”\nI can’t read Shihu’s expression.\n“I threw it away…”\n“Stop lying.”\n“……”\nIt’s a lie.\nI didn’t mean for it to go like this.\n“I’m going in.”\n“No, you can’t.”\nI try my best to block him.\nI don’t want it to go this far.\n“Then tell me properly. What happened?”\n“Sorry… I…”\nI just have a headache.\nWhy did it turn out like this?\nWhy?\nI’m the one\nwho let these useless thoughts get to me.\nMaybe I should take some drugs.\nShihu won’t make a big fuss about it anyway.\n“Sorry, just come in. It’s messy, but…”\nAnyway, if Shihu really wants to come in, I can’t stop him.\nI have no excuse.\nI’m still in a panic.\nI did weird things.\nThis is why I hated when people brought up the past.\nThe first aid kit with the drugs is right in plain sight when he walks in.\nI tried to hide it, but I couldn’t.\nI wonder if Shihu believes me.\nTrust has already been broken.\n“Sorry for doing weird things. I’ll tell you everything, so just wait a little.”\nI’ll just live like usual.\nShihu and I are probably going to break our relationship.\nIt’s all ruined.\nWell, to be honest, Seo Ah and I are pretty similar.\nShe just ended up going down the worse path.\nFor now, I need to calm down with some drugs.\n“What are you doing?”\nShihu grabs my arm.\n“If I take the drug, I think I can talk.”\n“You have healing skills too, don’t you? What kind of drug is it?”\n“It’s because I heal. I just get rid of side effects with healing.”\n“What?”\n“I’m fine with anything. As long as healing gets rid of the side effects, I’m good.”\nThat’s right.\nMaximizing convenience.\nI can do anything.\n“Do you want to use it too? I can help you use it safely.”\nShihu looks speechless.\nHe lets go of my arm.\nI guess he’s telling me to use it.\nI grab the pen-shaped syringe and inject.\n*Stab.*\nThe effect kicks in immediately.\nI feel a little better.\nAnyway, it’s all messed up now, so I’ll just show the worst of it.\n“Where did you get the drug from?”\n“…The lab.”\nIt’s a problem that I’m starting to feel drowsy.\n“The lab?”\n“Yeah.”\n“What happened?”\nI’ve never told Shihu about my past.\nNot to Shihu, and not to anyone.\n“Seo Ah probably got the drugs from there too. Or not.”\n“What are you saying?”\n“Anyway… the photo, the photo…”\nIt was a mistake to try to gauge his reaction with the photo.\nI feel bad.\nWhy did I do such a useless thing?\nWhen I used the drug last time, I didn’t use self-healing skills.\nThat’s why the effect kept going, and I think I made a weird decision.\nIt’s still a bit strange.\nBut it feels like I’m going back to the past.\nLooking at it now.\n“Ah, Seo Ah probably wasn’t suffering that much. If she took the drugs properly, it wouldn’t have been painful.”\nThe basic drugs are meant to reduce pain.\n“……”\n“So, Seo Ah must have been happy too. She’s even smiling in the photo…”\nMy vision spins.\n*Thud.*\nMy head hurts.\nI fall to the ground.\nThe ceiling is in view.\nShihu doesn’t seem to like what I said.\n“Was everything fine as long as Seo Ah was okay? She probably never thought she was unhappy.”\nI don’t know what part made Shihu angry.\n*Crunch.*\n“Ugh.”\nMy stomach is stepped on.\nIt seems like he’s really angry.\nShihu opens his mouth.\n“This is just like the photo.”\nIndeed.\nWas Seo Ah feeling like this too?\n“Ugh…”\nI can’t breathe properly.\nIt feels like the air is being cut off.\nShihu keeps talking.\n“So now, what do you think? Are you happy?”\nA voice full of anger.\nHe wants me to experience Seo Ah’s situation.\nThis is an interesting experience,\nIf Shihu’s curious.\nMy honest thoughts.\nWhat am I thinking?\n“Yeah… I’m happy. So… Seo Ah probably liked it too.”\nShe was smiling while getting trampled, wasn’t she?\nJust like me.",

It’s not working.\"\nShihu tries to use a skill on himself.\nHe instinctively feels something is wrong.\n\"I came to discuss the materials we got from the place we went to last time. Don’t you remember?\"\nShihu wonders what kind of score the Saintess would get if she took an intelligence test.\n\"[Stamina Recovery]\"\nMore precisely, Stamina Recovery VI.\nHe was exhausted, so he uses it.\nThe Saintess looks a bit tired as well.\nHe plans to figure out why soon.\n\"Explain properly. There’s no reason for me to come to your house. You said we had an appointment, but...\"\nShihu checks his watch.\nThey’re far off from the scheduled time.\nIt’s still time for school.\n\"This is too early. What happened? Explain it to me.\"\nShihu checks his status window.\nThere’s no abnormal status.\nIt’s impossible to suddenly collapse.\nHe’s not that weak.\n\"Well, it’s just like I said earlier...\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nIf that’s the case, there’s only one option.\nTo use physical force.\n\"That can’t be.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nIt can’t be.\nI can’t accept that answer.\n\"You can self-heal, so you’re fine, right?\"\n\"What, what are you talking about?\"\n*Thud.*\nShihu throws a punch.\nThe Saintess is hiding something.\nIt’s not normal for him to be collapsed in her house.\n\"Wait—\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Ugh, why are you hitting me?\"\n\"Because you’re not telling me the truth.\"\nShihu is even more violent than before.\nThe Saintess wonders if she should have just let him go and escaped.\nIt was unexpected for him to wake up so quickly, and for him to use his fists right away was also unexpected.\nNothing is going according to plan.\n\"Seo Ah. You came because of the photo with Seo Ah, right?\"\n\"Photo?\"\n\"Yeah, this one.\"\nHe hands her the photo the Saintess had.\nIt’s stirred up a lot of memories of Seo Ah.\nThere’s no reason for Shihu to react so strongly.\n\"...Ah, are you in cahoots with the doctor?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n*Thud.*\nShihu pushes the Saintess against the wall.\nHe rolls up her sleeves.\nThere are needle marks on the Saintess’s arm.\n\"Right. Was it the drugs? The doctor told you to do it.\"\n\"Doctor?\"\n\"Now that I think about it, the doctor seemed to have connections with the government. You’re familiar with that area, aren’t you? You should know if they’re using drugs.\"\nThe Saintess recalls.\n\"Drugs? Um, the doctor, you mean the one I know? The drug dealer…\"\n\"Black clothes. The one who gave drugs to Seo Ah.\"\n\"Ah, ah, that person is famous. He’s dead.\"\n\"...What?\"\n\"He was spreading drugs everywhere, so the government dealt with him. I don’t know more than that.\"\n\"Then, where did you get this photo?\"\n\"You found it and showed it to me, right?\"\nShihu is momentarily at a loss for words.\nThere seems to be some truth in the Saintess’s confident words.\nThe last memory cuts off at the school.\nIt seemed like nothing happened until he was on his way to school.\nA bookstore?\nDid he stop by a bookstore?\nWhy?\nMemory confusion.\nHe doesn’t remember finding the photo.\nNo, maybe he saw something.\nWas it a photo?\nWhy did he show it to the Saintess?\nWhat’s clear is that the Saintess is hiding the truth.\nEven someone who isn’t Awakened can tell.\nThe Saintess isn’t good at lying.\n\"Why, why are you so obsessed with Seo Ah? Were you close?\"\nShihu doesn’t understand why she’s asking.\nWere they close?\n\"How do you know Seo Ah’s name?\"\n\"Huh? You told me her name.\"\n\"When?\"\n\"Uh, when did I?\"\nFrustrating.\n\"Clearly—\"\n*Thud.*\nHe grabs the Saintess’s shoulders and shoves her against the wall.\n\"Explain—\"\n*Thud.*\nHe slams her again against the wall, like he’s smashing it.\n\"Do it.\"\n*Bang.*\nHe punches the wall.\nChunks of the wall fall off.The Saintess is terrified.\n\"Th-That…\"\n\"Yeah, what did you say earlier?\"\nHe asked why she was obsessed with Seo Ah.\n\"Did I say I was close to Seo Ah?\"\nWhy did the Saintess ask this question?\n\"Why? Is it fine for a friend to disappear if the relationship isn’t good? Is it normal to abandon a friend just because they’re using drugs? Is it okay for them to suffer because they’ve become trash?\"\nThe Saintess manipulated memories under the guise of healing.\nMaybe it wasn’t enough with just one round.\nShe tried to twist Shihu’s memories so that Seo Ah would seem like a burden to him.\nThat she was an ungrateful presence.\nShe tampered with the memories like that.\n\"...When I was a child, I didn’t know anything. I was abandoned in a slum. I had no parents, no relatives.\"\nIt’s a story from the past.\n\"We grew up in a place like that, so it’s not surprising if our personalities were twisted or if we lacked manners. Do you think Seo Ah was such a great person that I became her friend?\"\nThe Saintess realizes her mistake.\nHealing? No, it only made things worse.\nShe thought multiple rounds of healing would help, but this wasn’t something that could be solved with that.\n\"It’s fine if you’re below normal. It’s okay if you’re lacking somewhere, not ordinary, if you don’t have common sense, if you learn slowly...\"\nShihu had been with Seo Ah for longer than expected.\nPerhaps even more than with his own family.\nAfter all the tampering with the memories, this was the reaction.\nHer attempt to separate him from Seo Ah had failed.\nWould things have turned out differently if the Saintess had been more careful?\n\"I liked seeing Seo Ah smile. It didn’t matter to me if she didn’t think much of me. Even if she hated me.\"\n\"...Sorry...\"\nThe Saintess apologizes.\n\"I was lucky to live in an environment where Seo Ah existed.\"\nOriginally, slums are places where laws and order aren’t established.\nIt doesn’t matter what you do.\n\"I wanted to be Seo Ah’s hero. I just wanted to at least pretend to be one.\"\nEveryone wants to be someone admirable.\nShe wanted to appear impressive to Seo Ah.\nPretending to be an adult by her side.\nTo be someone Seo Ah would look up to.\nTo be the one who keeps her safe.\n\"Even if Seo Ah hated me, she was still my childhood friend.\"\nEven if she tries to blame this situation on Seo Ah, she realizes it’s her own immaturity.\nIn the end, was she Seo Ah’s hero?\nA hero fighting villains?\nNo.\n\"Maybe I’ll stop pretending to be a noble hero now.\"\nThe Saintess will soon tell the truth.\n---\n### **Shihu keeps running.**\nThe message the Saintess showed him had an address.\nHe runs toward it.\nIs it a distance he can cover?\nYes.\nHe will find a way.\n---\n### **Before he starts running.**\nShihu discovers a new talent.\nFiguring out the truth doesn’t require extraordinary skill.\nThe Saintess talked for 25 minutes, but 20 of those minutes were spent on her stammering out the truth.\nUsing violence.\nThe Saintess was comfortable because she could self-heal.\nHe learns more about the Saintess’s past.\nThat she had met Seo Ah.\nThat Seo Ah was locked up in a lab for some reason.\nThe doctor, who the Saintess knew, had died before Seo Ah even met him.\nThat the Saintess had manipulated memories under the guise of healing.\nThat tampered memories will return over time.\nHe hears everything.\nHe reviews the text messages.\nPhotos and videos sent by an anonymous source.\nWhat’s clear is that Seo Ah was treated like a monster.\nShihu couldn’t continue watching the videos.\nEven if it wasn’t Seo Ah, he would have hated watching it.\n\"I was there too…\"\nThe Saintess buries her face in her knees as she speaks.\n\"I just wanted to run away from there… When Seo Ah went in, I ran off…\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"I wasn’t always this foolish… It was because of the experiment…\"\nThe Saintess laments, but Shihu doesn’t care.\nHe calls the number saved in the Saintess’s phone.\nHe hopes someone picks up.\n- The number you dialed is no longer in service.\nBut the number doesn’t exist.\nThere’s only one option left.\nRun to the address the Saintess gave him.\n---\n### **He keeps running.**\nUsing his Stamina Recovery skill, he turns all his mana into stamina.\nIs it faster to take a taxi, or is running faster?\nIn the end, the destination is outside the city.\nA dangerous zone where monsters could appear at any moment.\nUsing a vehicle requires tedious procedures.\nIs Seo Ah still alive?\nIf she is, what should he do?\nIf what he saw in the video is real, even Shihu wouldn’t have been able to stay sane in that situation.\nWho’s holding Seo Ah?\nIs it an enemy?\nWhat’s the Saintess’s real purpose in trying to heal him?\nIf it’s someone holding her, Shihu thought it would be the doctor.\nBut no.\nAccording to the Saintess, the doctor had been dead for a while.\nThat’s why Shihu couldn’t find him, even as he sought revenge.\nIf not the doctor, then who?\nHe will find out.\nThe road disappears, and the mountain appears.\nHe keeps running.\nThe branches brush against his face.\n\"[Cleansing Strike]\"\nHe draws his sword and uses the skill.\nA beam of light cuts through the obstructing trees.\nHe’s going straight.\nTo the destination.\nIs running blindly the wise choice?\nShould he be calling for backup?\nTrustworthy people.\nBut there’s no time.\nEven running isn’t fast enough.\nFaster!\nFaster!\nFaster!\nHe shouts this over and over in his mind.\nHe believes Seo Ah is already dead.\nEven if she’s alive, she’s not in her right mind.\nIt wouldn’t be surprising if she was someone’s plaything.\nShut up.\nHe regrets everything deeply.\nAll of it.\nWhether the memories the Saintess planted were malicious or not.\nEverything is hateful.\nThe destination is getting closer.\nHe ran until the sun set.\nThe stars are clear now.\nThe air is cold.\nHis breathing is heavy.\nIn the distance, faint lights are visible.",

Ugh.\"\nThe air is too thick.\nIf they weren’t Awakened, they wouldn’t last much longer.\nShihu picks up the researcher and runs outside the building.\nTo a safer area.\n\"What happened?\"\nHe asks while running.\n\"Escape... someone set the monsters free. I don’t know how, but...\"\n\"Why would they do that?\"\n\"Probably a villain. You’re Awakened, right? A good one? Phew, that’s a relief. You’re gonna help me, aren’t you? Thanks.\"\nThey run past the destroyed barricades to an area where the fire hasn’t spread.\n\"Is there anyone else?\"\nShihu waits for the researcher to answer.\n\"Well, they’re either dead or escaped.\"\n\"What about the test subjects?\"\n\"Huh? Human-shaped ones? You knew about them?\"\n\"Are they here?\"\nThe rumors of human-shaped test subjects had been circulating for a long time.\n\"We disposed of all of them.\"\n\"...Disposed?\"\n\"When the facility malfunctions, the protocol is to kill and run. That’s the manual. The suppression team is probably handling it now.\"\n\"Where do I go?\"\n\"The biggest building in the center, in the basement... But why would you want to know... You want to rescue them? They’re not human, and I hate to say it, but they’re not worth saving.\"\n\"Shut up.\"\n*Thud.*\nShihu knocks the researcher unconscious.\nThen he starts running again.\nThe layout of this place is similar to the experimental facility from before.\nThere are strange organizations like suppression teams and rescue teams.\nHe knows they’re government organizations.\nHe suspected something was off back then, but now he knows for sure.\nThe suppression team is the enemy.\nHe keeps running.\nThe central building is in sight.\n*Boom!*\nHe breaks through the wall to enter.\nIs Seo Ah inside here?\nHe doesn’t know what the disposal procedure is, but he has to stop it.\nHe doesn’t know what state Seo Ah is in, but he must stop it.\nThe inside is filled with flames.\nThe fire isn’t a problem.\nThe protective function of the academy uniform is enough to handle this.\nThe researcher’s clothes have some protective function, but it’s not as good as the uniform.\n\"Seo Ah?\"\nHe calls out, hoping for a response.\nBut no one is there.\nHe continues searching the building.\nSince the facility extends downwards, he searches for a way to go down.\n\"Elevator?\"\n*Creek.*\nHe forces open the elevator doors.\nOf course, the elevator isn’t even on the floor Shihu is on, and it wasn’t even moving.\nSo, he jumps down.\nHe falls through the smoke and drops to the lowest floor.\n*Thud.*\nIt’s unclear whether it’s a landing or a crash.\nDust rises, but Shihu doesn’t know if it’s because he fell or because of the fire.\nHe stumbles up and dashes through the facility.\nHe sees signs of where the monsters were kept.\nAs it’s the lowest floor, escape must have been difficult.\nMost of the monsters have likely gone through the disposal procedure the researcher mentioned.\n\"-What’s that? Someone’s behind me!\"\nIt’s the suppression team.\nThey’re wearing heavy armor that looks like spacesuits.\nTheir voices are muffled inside the armor, making it hard to hear clearly.\nOn their arms, they carry firearms and flamethrowers.\nKilling monsters is the right thing to do.\nThe suppression team only kills monsters.\n*Thud.*\nBut Shihu easily takes down the suppression team.\nThey were likely the ones who started the fire in the building, so they’ll probably survive the collapse or the fire.\n\"Who—\"\n*Crack.*\nA blow with the hilt of his sword is enough.\nThe suppression team’s armor is tough, but it’s specialized in blocking monster attacks, not human ones.\nStill, if they didn’t have the armor, it would’ve been a fatal blow.\n\"Monsters—?\"\n*Crack.*\n\"Behind me!\"\n*Thud.*\nAs he runs, he neutralizes the suppression team.\nBut he doesn’t manage to take them all down.\nHe wants to interrogate them one by one, but there’s no time.\n\"Everything’s done. Hurry up and follow me!\"\nDone?\n\"What’s going on?\"\nIt’s hard to see through the fog.\nNow that he notices, it’s not smoke—it’s fog.\nHe thought they were using flamethrowers to spread fire, but it seems like they were dispersing gas instead.\nFor dealing with so many monsters, this type of weapon is effective.\nThe monsters won’t just stand still and inhale the gas, but the monsters in this place are all confined.\n\"Done with the processing! Let’s go up!\"\n\"Where’s the human-shaped test subject?\"\n\"What are you talking about? They were transferred a while ago! Let’s go! We’ll die!\"\n*Boom.*\nA foreboding sound echoes.\nSince the facility is so deep underground, if it collapses, it’ll cause even more trouble.\n\"It could collapse!\"\n*Boom.*\nThe sound gets louder.\nThe lights that barely flickered are now dying.\nSmoke and fog have covered everything.\n\"But who are you... Damn it, it’s collapsing!\"\n*Crash.*\nThe building is collapsing faster than expected.\nThe structure loses its support and crushes everything underneath.\n---\n### **After the Collapse**\nThe fire has spread to the nearby mountain, but it hasn’t grown much.\nWhere the flames passed, only ruins remain.\nNo signs of life.\nOnly ashes are left.\nThe concrete cracks with a creaking sound.\nThen it shatters.\nAnd a hand emerges.\nIt pulls apart the crack in the concrete.\nOnce it’s wide enough, it crawls out.\n\"-Cough.\"\nIt was a close call.\nHe wasn’t in his usual condition, and the situation was unlike any other.\nBut in the end, he survived.\nSomehow.\nShihu doesn’t die.\nHe won’t die until he saves Seo Ah.\nSeo Ah isn’t below him.\nHe should have asked where she was transferred.\nHe’s not even sure if she was ever here.\nBlood drips steadily.\nEven with physical enhancement and protective skills, there are limits.\nJust running here took a toll on him.\n\"Dammit.\"\nBut still, somehow, he survived.\nSomehow.\nSo where’s the next destination?\nWhere should he go to find her?\nExhaustion.\nIt’s a feeling he hasn’t experienced in a long time.\n\"...I’m going.\"\nHis device is broken, so he can’t track his location.\nBut he has to save Seo Ah.\nThe person who knocked him out earlier—\nWhere are they?\nRunning is uncomfortable.\nHe probably has a few broken bones.\nBut it’s okay.\nHe’ll heal.\nCompared to the pain Seo Ah endured, it’s nothing.\nHe wipes the blood dripping from his forehead and keeps running.\nHe finds it.\nThe researcher lying there.\n\"Get up.\"\n*Thud.*\nHe steps on the researcher’s finger to wake him.\n\"Ugh...?\"\nThe researcher comes to his senses.\n\"Tell me what you know. Where’s the place where they transferred the human-shaped test subjects?\"\n\"That... um...\"\n*Crunch.*\nHe steps harder on the researcher’s finger.\n\"Ah! I don’t know!\"\n\"Is there another experimental facility nearby?\"\n\"I’m just a low-level guy, so I don’t know about other facilities, but the factory that supplies resources here...\"\n\"Which way?\"\n\"Go straight along the road, about 10 kilometers. I know because I’ve been there with the vehicle. People live there, and we receive goods from there...\"\nHe doesn’t need to hear more.\nHe immediately starts\nrunning in the direction the researcher indicated.\nEvery second counts.\nIf Seo Ah is alive, even if the possibility is small, he has to find her.\nHe has to.\nHe runs.\nThe direction is the complete opposite.\nHe cuts across the entire experimental facility, pushing through the flames.\n\"Shihu!\"\nSomeone calls out to Shihu.\nThere’s someone standing near the entrance of the facility.\n\"Are you okay?\"\nThe silver hair is familiar.\n\"...Lena?\"\n\"The device was destroyed, so the alert went off. The one we set up when we were on the team.\"\n\"Ah.\"\nWith the collapse of the building, the device was destroyed.\nIt must have been how the alert went off.\n\"I came along too.\"\nA girl with short blue hair.\n\"Cheon Yuhwa? Why are you here?\"\nShe’s a rival, not someone Shihu is particularly close to.\n\"I called for help. I happened to be with Lena. You disappeared after taking the top spot in the academy rankings... Anyway, what’s going on? You’re covered in blood, and everything’s burned.\"\n\"I don’t have time. I need to rescue Seo Ah.\"\nThere’s no time.\nAre his academy friends really going to help in this situation?\n\"Seo Ah... Who’s that?\"\nCheon Yuhwa asks, not knowing much about Shihu’s personal life.\n\"She’s my friend.\"\n\"Is that so? Where are you heading?\"\n\"To the factory zone in that direction.\"\n\"Then get in the car. My family’s driving. Cheon Yuseong! Over here!\"\nShe calls her twin brother.\n\"Quite the unusual siblings...\"\nLena laughs.\nNow, there are four people.\nThe SUV pulls up.\n\"Hello!\"\nThe window rolls down, and Cheon Yuseong leans out.\n\"Do you have a driver’s license?\"\nShihu asks casually.\nHe knew Cheon Yuseong but didn’t expect him to be driving.\n\"Our family’s a bit unique, so driving’s no problem. Get in!\"\n\"Thanks. I appreciate everyone coming to help.\"\nAs Shihu gets in the car, he wonders if it’s a good idea to have someone who doesn’t know the situation join in.\nBut it’s better than being alone.\n\"...But is Seo Ah really alive?\"\nLena whispers, looking strangely like she might cry.\n\"...Really?\"",

      "content": "Life is inherently pain.\nPerhaps the only currency humans truly possess is pain, used to purchase fleeting happiness. Most people live this way.\nThey endure the pain of labor and exchange it for the happiness that money can buy. Pain comes first, happiness follows. But some purchase happiness on credit. And eventually, the debt must be repaid.\nA debt of pain.\nI, too, am deeply in debt.\nThe pleasure the drugs brought me came without any price paid in pain.\nIt feels like an inherited debt, one impossible to renounce.\nSince I was already ruined, I kept borrowing, again and again, until the limit.\nUntil even repaying the interest became an insurmountable task.\nStab.\nBut there is a way out!\nI can transfer my debt to others.\nAll the weapons I create are made of pain—pain I should have endured.\nIf someone else bears that pain in my stead, I can repay my debts.\nCrunch.\nGive and take.\nIf I give pain, the other takes it.\nIt’s strange I hadn’t realized this simple rule before. When I killed the suppression team trying to murder Researcher A, I didn’t understand it at the time, but that was when I began to regain my sanity.\nThe madness receded, enough for me to speak again.\nI had repaid some of the interest.\nThrust.\nThat’s why I killed the doctor.\nI gave him the pain I was supposed to endure.\n“Hehe…”\nI stab and stab again.\nThe doctor was a good person.\nThat’s why I feel guilty.\nThe guilt is the price I pay for this excessive happiness.\n[2%]\nMaybe it means 2,000 hours.\nWhen it hit 1%, it had been over 1,000 hours. Or was it?\n2,000 isn’t a small number.\nBut if it’s not time, then what does it represent?\n-Static.\nThe radio, which I thought was merely decoration, suddenly comes to life. A voice echoes in the quiet study.\n“Monsters have been released near the experimental facility.”\nIt’s the doctor’s voice.\n“The medicine Seo Ah used has exhausted the supply for residents near the factory. If monsters attack, the residents have no way to defend themselves.”\nIt’s definitely his voice. But I just killed him. His corpse is right here. Yet the voice continues.\n“I trust Seo Ah will handle the situation.”\nIt sounds like an order: take care of the monsters.\n“I got the idea from how Seo Ah escaped. Thank you.”\nThen… what did I just kill?\nIf not the doctor, was it a puppet dressed like him? A pre-recorded message?\n“What the hell…?”\nMy mind refuses to function. I try to process the doctor’s words but fail.\n“Ah, so monsters are coming?”\nYes.\nThey want me to protect the residents.\n“So what?”\nWhat am I supposed to do? I’m too busy repaying debts. Even paying the interest is overwhelming.\nSo… I’ll shift the pain onto the monsters.\nThey’ll repay my debt in my place.\nAnd I’ll be happy.\n“Hahaha… Hahahahaha!”\nI’m happy.\nI’ve already used all the drugs in the study. Maybe that’s why I killed the doctor?\nThat was the plan all along: use him and then dispose of him.\nThere are more drugs in the drawer, stronger ones. Great.\nLet’s take them first, then figure things out.\n“Hehehe…”\nThe debt is overwhelming.\nBuying pleasure has caused this problem.\nBut others will pay for it.\nThose who threw me into the trash, who treated me worse than human. They’re the ones to blame for this society, for making Seo Ah shoulder this debt.\nAs long as it’s repaid.\nThe mirror by the study door shows a monster.\nIt looks like Seo Ah, but it’s not.\nHaha, no wonder human rights were taken away.\nIf I were a researcher, I’d want to study this too.\nThe eyes, though.\nWhy do they look like that?\nIt’s disturbing. No wonder I want to smash the mirror.\n“It’s all your fault,” the reflection says, laughing.\n“Everything is your fault.”\nNo, it’s not.\n“This all happened because of your mistakes.”\nNo, it didn’t.\n“It’s all your fault.”\n“All my fault? Don’t make me laugh! If it weren’t for me, you wouldn’t even be here! I did everything—everything!—and you know how hard it was for me!”\n“It’s because of your mistakes.”\n“I didn’t make a mistake! It only looks like a mistake because you don’t see the results. Everything worked out, didn’t it? If the results are good, isn’t that all that matters? People who say otherwise are idiots! Even if my actions were wrong, it was the situation that forced me. Anyone would have done the same!”\n“Why did you do it?”\n“Why do I have to keep explaining myself? I had reasons! But no one listens. They just blame me. They don’t even try to understand. So what’s the point of talking? It’s useless!”\nBecause people hate me.\nBecause I hate myself.\nBecause I’m no different from a monster.\n“Exactly!”\nIf the world made me this way, why should I hate myself?\nIt’s not just my fault.\nSo no one has the right to blame me.\n“You’re nothing. Dust pretending to understand the universe while it’s blown away by the wind. Your face is sand. Shatter.”\n“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I was born. I’m sorry I ruined the world. I should’ve died. I’m sorry I’m still alive.”\nThe mirror warps. Or maybe I just broke it.\n“The researchers are laughing at me. Mocking me! But I’ll kill them! Rip them apart! If I do that, you’ll like me again, right? If I do that, everything will be okay. I know I was wrong. But if I kill the monsters, I’ll be forgiven! I’ll be forgiven!”\nLet’s kill the monsters. Quickly.\nThe corroded walls drip with rust. Broken pipes leak grease, and the roads run with blood.\nI see monsters.\nThey’re like friends.\nExcept for the part where they kill people, they’ve done nothing wrong.\nBut I’m the kind of trash who attacks even friends!\nSorry, Shihu.\nI’m trash.\nCrunch.\nBlack branches pierce the monsters.\nWeapons made of pure pain.\nKilling these raises my level.\nDozens fall without resistance.\n[3%]\nIt’s gone up a bit.\nThis isn’t the drugs’ effect.\nIt’s the repayment rate.\nThe percentage of debt I’ve repaid.\nWhen it hits 100%, I’ll be free.\nDebt-free.\nFreedom.\nBut do I even need freedom?\nWhy not just stay trapped here and die?\nI’m no different from a monster.\nA pathetic creature passing its debts onto others.\nWhy am I still alive?\n“I must have deserved it. Being treated like that… I must have deserved it.”\nBoom.\nThe sound of a monster exploding.\n“I’m so sorry. I can’t be anything else. I have debts to repay. I deserve this. But I didn’t want to be here! I’m not a monster!”\nI use drugs because it’s time to level up.\nI killed so many monsters.\nI’m too kind. That’s the problem.\nThere’s Shihu.\nCovered in blood, panting, he runs toward me.\nHe looks at me.\nHis face is a mix of relief and fear.\n“Seo Ah?”\nWhy is he calling my name?\nHe’s holding a sword.\nIt’s covered in blood.\nA sword?\nA blade?\nHe’s going to stab me again.\nWhen I come to my senses, I’ll already be stabbed.\nScared. Terrified. Sorry for betraying you.\nPlease spare me.\nBut he still holds the sword.\nHe still thinks I’m a monster.\nDamn it. Damn it. Damn it.\nI’m not.\nI cover my strange eyes with my hand.\nEven though I look more like a monster than ever, I’m not one!\n“Seo Ah?”\nHow long will you torment me?\nI already apologized!\nWhy won’t you leave me alone?\nDoes Han Shihu still hate me?\nWill he choke me?

      "content": "Shihu approaches.\nI’m not a monster.\nI begged for forgiveness, so why is he coming closer?\nI need to run.\nI still haven’t received proper treatment.\nMy condition is unstable, and I don’t want to see Shihu right now.\nBut I did tell the Saintess to come, but I never asked Shihu to.\nIs that really Shihu?\nHe looks badly injured.\n“Seo Ah?”\nSeo Ah?\nIf you pull off all the petals of a flower, is it still a flower?\nWhen you tear away each layer of identity—self, personality, humanity, and reason—what remains is something barely human.\n“I’m not Seo Ah.”\nSeo Ah is cuter, kinder, and purer than I am.\n“It’ll be okay, Seo Ah…”\nWho is Seo Ah?\nI’m not her.\nI’m not like that.\n“No, I’m… I’m just a tuna can!”\nThat makes sense.\nNowhere is it written that I am Seo Ah.\nBut it is written that I’m a tuna can.\n“Eh?”\n“Ah, hello, I’m the tuna can. Cute name, right? You gave it to me, so now I must take care of it. Right? I’m bringing it to Seo Ah with me…”\n“What… are you saying?”\nYou don’t understand?\nThat’s fine.\nBut that’s not important.\n“You went to the academy, right? Seo Ah was at home. She was home, wasn’t she?”\nShe should be at home.\n“I don’t know much as a tuna can. But Seo Ah really seemed to want to play with you.”\nI talk about what’s been happening.\nAbout what I’ve been through.\nIt’s been a long time since we’ve seen each other.\n“When you didn’t show up, I watched from the window at your house. You weren’t there. But did you know? The curtains in your room waved. It told me to wait. So, I waited. All day long.”\nAll day.\nAll night.\nBut Shihu had no intention of coming.\n“You never came to Seo Ah, did you? I mean, of course, why would you? You have other friends. But isn’t it funny? Seo Ah was clearly waiting for you, but I saw you laughing and walking with other people. I saw you talking to that one, laughing with them. But it’s fine. Really, it’s fine. You should do what you want. I’m just sitting here. I’m the type to be okay with that. I get it, you probably don’t like me, no one likes me.”\nWhat are you babbling about?\n“But why are you standing still like that? Are you hiding something? Are you trying to calm me down by pretending to reassure me, but then attack? Something’s off. You’re hiding something, aren’t you? Aren’t you? You’re supposed to tell me something, but you’re not. Right? Why aren’t you answering?!”\n“…”\nShihu seems like he wants to say something, but hesitates for a moment.\nOur eyes meet.\nHe seems surprised.\n“Seo Ah, your eyes…?”\nEyes?\nI must have accidentally removed my hand from covering them.\nDid he see?\nI cover them again.\n“Eyes? Oh, it’s nothing. I’m just tired, that’s all. Yeah, I’m tired. I’m definitely not a monster.”\n“No one thinks you’re a monster.”\n“I’m just a tuna can. Or maybe cabbage or lettuce. Wait—did you come with someone else? Are they hiding?”\nA vehicle, partly wrecked, is visible in the distance.\nIt seems it was attacked by monsters.\nSmoke is rising; it just arrived.\nShihu doesn’t know how to drive.\n“I… I’m going home. Alone. So stay here. Okay? You go play with your friends!”\nI take a step back.\n“And you wouldn’t know, but I have friends too. I can hang out with them when I get home… Friends don’t threaten me with knives… Haha…”\nThere’s a reason I need to go home.\nI don’t have anywhere else to go, really.\n“I came here just to talk to myself. Others won’t interfere. I’m just dealing with monsters over there, don’t worry.”\nHe’s coming closer.\n“Don’t come.”\nCrunch.\nHe attacks.\nBlack roots shoot out, aiming to strike Shihu.\nThe roots of a tree.\n“You’re like a rotten root beneath a tree. No one cares about you.”\nAn odd voice echoes.\n“Shut up.”\n[5%]\nFor every transfer of pain, I repay the debt.\nI’m thankful to those who help repay my debt.\nBut the only thing I can give in return is pain.\nScrape.\nWith a flash of light, the black roots are severed.\nThe attack fails.\nThis time, the attack is sharper, thinner.\nBut it’s blocked just as easily.\n“You shouldn’t have existed from the start. Who made you? It must have been a mistake. If mistakes still exist, you are that mistake. The world would be better without you.”\n“Please, shut up…”\nI wish everyone would just die.\nCrunch, crunch, crunch.\nBlack branches and thorns.\nNo matter how hard I attack, I can’t surpass Shihu.\nBecause he’s the protagonist.\nEven covered in blood, he effortlessly blocks every one of my strikes.\n“Don’t come here. You’re not the only one with friends.”\nI’ll have my friends come help me.\nThey’ll come.\n“I… I have a friend who even gives me gifts.”\nA gift.\nIt was a ribbon.\nBlack.\nA ribbon?\nWhere did it go?\nI’m not one to wear ribbons often.\n“A gift… a ribbon… a friend’s gift… I had one, but… I lost it. Wait a second, I think I dropped it.”\nI look at the ground, but all I can see are stones.\n“Try making sense. But honestly, everything you’re saying is trash. It’s meaningless. I don’t even want to listen. Just be quiet. Your voice is polluting the world. Stones are better. They’re quiet.”\nWhat are you saying?\nIt’s noisy.\nThe ribbon is right here.\n“Ah, here it is. Haha.”\nWith trembling hands, I pick up the ribbon from the ground.\nI could never lose the gift a friend gave me.\nSeo Ah, who has stopped attacking, picks something up from the ground.\n“Look, it’s a ribbon.”\nIt’s not a ribbon. It’s wire.\nShe smiles, holding the discarded wire.\n“It’s the gift from a friend. I have friends too.”\nThe ribbon was from Shihu.\nBut this is wire.\nSeo Ah uses the wire to tie a bit of her hair.\nBut the wire is too loose to stay.\nIt falls to the ground with a soft thud.\n“…”\nSilence.\nThat can’t be a ribbon.\nIt’s just wire.\n“…Tuna can doesn’t wear ribbons.”\nSeo Ah says this and steps on the wire.\nShihu, who had succeeded in reuniting with Seo Ah, is unable to understand anything.\nTuna can?\nI don’t understand.\nMy head hurts.\nThe situation is strange.\n“I’m sorry, Seo Ah.”\nI apologize.\nI don’t even know what to say.\nBut I won’t give up on Seo Ah.\n“I’m a tuna can, okay? It’s delicious.”\nSeo Ah tilts her head, looking confused.\n“No, you’re…”\n“Don’t come.”\nBut still, she moves closer.\n“It’s not a tuna can. It’s Seo Ah.”\n“I told you not to come…”\nOne more step closer.\nJust standing still won’t solve anything.\nThere’s no other way.\n“I’ll save you. I promise.”\nSomehow.\nJust the fact that Seo Ah is alive is enough to be thankful for.\nLet’s be grateful for her life, and find hope.\n“Ha, aha, I know who you are.”\nSeo Ah, stepping back, speaks.\n“You’re a researcher, right? You’re planning to take me again?”\n“No.”\n“Shut up.”\nThe fact that she’s angry is new.\nThis is the first time I’ve seen Seo Ah this angry.\n“It’s all your fault. Not me. You’re the monster, not me—”\nThud.\nSeo Ah trips on something as she steps back.\nShe tries to stand but fails.\nHer clothes seem caught on something.\nShe can’t escape.\nSeo Ah, with a terrified expression, slowly looks up.\nShe can’t escape.\n“Ahhhh, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I was wrong, I was wrong.”\n“No.”\nNo, don’t apologize.\n“It’s my fault that I cursed and attacked. You’re trying to fix it, right? I’m a bad person, I need to be fixed… I’m so sorry.”\n“No…”\nShihu, who hears this, feels as though he wants to die.\nWhat happened to Seo Ah?\nWho did this to her?\nNo one answers, no matter how many questions he asks.\n“Just tell me what you want… I was wrong, I’ll do anything… Do I need to cut off a finger? Close my eyes? What should I do? Hehe…”\n“…”\n“Ahhhh, it’s because I moved, right? I won’t do it again… No, I won’t move… I can even stop breathing if that’s the problem… I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”\nBut now, Seo Ah doesn’t get angry at Shihu’s approach.\nShihu moves closer.\nHe stretches out his hand, close enough to touch her.\nSeeing Seo Ah, his childhood friend, show a submissive attitude feels strange.\nBeing soaked in drugs and not recognizing him is even stranger.\nFailing to hold her breath.\nTrying to crawl back when he reaches out to help, but getting stuck on her clothes.\nThere are no words.\nIt’s clear he’s only causing more harm, not help.\nBut still, he reaches out again.\nA bloodstained hand.\nWhether it’s Shihu or Seo Ah, both are covered in wounds.\n“Let’s go home.”\nIt feels like we’ve come too far.\nIt’s time to go home.",

Together.”\nMy hand touches his, but nothing happens.\nIsn’t he a researcher?\nI want to go home too.\nBut that right has been stripped from me.\n“Can I go home...?”\n“Of course.”\n“I don’t even know where home is.”\nHow will I find it?\n“Let’s go together.”\nSo kind.\nHe smiles at me.\n“Shihu will be disappointed.”\n“He won’t be.”\n“I’m not a good person.”\n“It doesn’t matter.”\nHe only says what sounds nice.\nThank you.\n“I tried to hide the drugs, but I got caught…”\n“That’s not your fault. It’s okay.”\nThis isn’t something I wanted.\n“Yeah, because it’s not my fault.”\nNo, I wanted it.\nIf I hadn’t craved it, I wouldn’t have sunk so deep into the drugs.\nHundreds, thousands of doses.\n“It’s not my fault. It’s not my fault. It’s not my fault! No, I didn’t want this.”\nEven if I wasn’t dragged into the lab, I would’ve crawled there myself and begged for the drugs.\nEven if they granted me freedom, if I needed the drugs, I’d live like a worm for it.\n“I couldn’t help it. There was no other way. It wasn’t because I enjoyed it. It just happened. Don’t blame me. If it weren’t for that, it would’ve been worse. What I did was better. What’s so bad about enjoying it a little?”\nAnyway, I did it because I wanted to.\nIf I really hated it, I shouldn’t have done it.\nDrugs.\n“Hahaha, if you were in that situation, you’d have done the same. I was in pain, trying to get treatment.”\nBut I was happy.\nWith every dose, the pleasure came, and I didn’t feel much pain.\nSo I got something out of it.\nI didn’t lose, I wasn’t a victim.\nAnyway, I felt good.\n“That’s… how it was…”\nIt’s like drowning, but drowning in chocolate.\nAnyway, it was sweet.\nIt tasted good.\n“It’s not your fault.”\n“…”\nEven hearing those words, deep inside, I feel the opposite.\nIt is my fault.\nIt’s not just my fault, but it’s still mine.\nSo, I’ll pay my debts.\nThen I’ll have served my punishment.\n“So let’s go together. To my home.”\nWho are you to say that?\nFinally, I pay attention to the person in front of me.\n“…Shihu?”\n“Yeah. Do you recognize me?”\n“Is it really you?”\n“Yes.”\nHis expression lightens.\nIt’s Shihu.\nThen… what should I do?\nI need to ask the most important question.\n“Where is Seo Ah?”\n“…What are you talking about?”\nYou should know, we were close.\nWait, this is strange.\nSince when did we live apart?\n“Seo Ah? She’s probably at home. Eating apples, I guess. Must be delicious.”\nShe’s not a combatant.\nShe wouldn’t come out to fight.\nShe was never made to be a fighter.\n“Seo Ah?”\nShihu looks confused.\nI’m the one who should be confused.\nDoes he think I’m Seo Ah?\nI must’ve introduced myself, right?“Seo Ah. Everything will be fine. I can heal you. So…”\n“Seo Ah? I’m the drug-preserved tuna can. The expiration date is…”\n**[10%]**\n“10% expired. Hehe. But 90% is still fresh. The drug must be the preservative, right?”\nIt feels like my brain is melting.\nI love tuna cans.\nIf I lift my shirt, there will still be scars.\nThis one, and several others.\nThere’s also a list of errands.\n“I said I don’t like vegetables, but why do I keep running errands? I told you I don’t eat that stuff. Why do I have to buy it? Why are the memos always missing?”\nWhy?\nI don’t know the reason.\n“…Sorry. I… like this…”\nWhat is he saying?\nI can’t understand.\nSpeak louder.\n“It’ll be okay. We can go back to how things were.”\nBack then?\nI don’t want to go back to the lab.\nEven if science advances with my sacrifice, I won’t go.\n“So, let’s go together.”\nI’m not going.\n- Ah, the results of this experiment… Actually, there’s no need to record it. It’s just out of curiosity to see how long they can hold out.\n- Even in that state, their will is still intact.\nI refuse.\n- It’s not willpower. It’s just a reflex.\n- Must be a good feeling. Soaked in drugs.\nPleasure seems to arise in places where it shouldn’t.\nJust because I feel good doesn’t mean the fear is gone.\n- Increase the dosage to double the previous amount.\nAnd there’s nothing I remember.\nScattered, strange memories rise.\nI’m too scared to look back at them.\nBut they keep forcing their way through.\nA little further back into the past.\n- For a monster, they’re very human-like.\n- This?\n- Looking at their actions, they are indeed a monster.\n“Step back, Shihu. It’s a monster.”\nI stop the flashback.\nA girl with blue hair appears.\nA cold chill stretches toward me.\n“She just looks like your friend. Don’t be deceived by appearances.”\n“Cheon Yuhwa, I told you not to come. I’ll handle this.”\nCheon Yuhwa.\nCheon Yuhwa?\nI’ve seen her at the academy.\nWas it at the entrance ceremony?\n“This is more dangerous than the monster that attacked our car.”\nShe points at me.\nSeems there’s some misunderstanding.\nI’m not dangerous.\n“You’ll see too. With this amount of magical power… you’ll be designated as a target for extermination. Anyone other than someone like me would have a hard time killing you.”\nKill me?\nWho?\nWhy?\nFor fun?\nI understand.\nIt’s possible.\nBut I won’t die.\n“I won’t kill you. Seo Ah will be fine-”\nBecause tuna cans are inanimate.\nIt’s just that a living thing was inside.\n“Shihu. I didn’t expect you to be so weak. Even with a monster right in front of you… Those eyes show that you’re not human.”\n“Yeah, I’m a tuna can!”\nCan a can be human?\n“…Huh?”\nCheon Yuhwa tilts her head slightly.\n“You don’t belong here. Step back. This is the last time I’ll say this nicely.”\nShihu warns me.\n“You’re out of your mind. You think that’s your friend?”\n“Yeah.”\n“I don’t know your situation well. But, without proper explanation, I can’t leave this alive. If we don’t exterminate the monster now, the damage will get worse-”\n“Seo Ah is not a monster. It’s not her fault that she turned out like this.”\nThe argument continues.\n“Black magic, like something from a dungeon’s deep monsters. How can you claim she’s human? Even if she was human once, no one could change this much. Sorry for messing with your emotions, but this is the truth.”\n“So, are you going to attack?”\n“If you can’t persuade me, that might be the only option. Right now, all I see is someone bringing a monster and claiming it’s human.”\n“You shouldn’t always believe what you see.”\nThe atmosphere grows tense.\nAre we about to fight?\nNormally, I’d expect Shihu to win.\nBut Shihu looks battered and exhausted.\n“If I’m not mistaken, you were just in a fight. With this. But suddenly, your attitude has changed. I suspect you’ve been mentally manipulated.”\nShihu fought with this?\nWhen?\nI only attacked the researcher.\nBut when did Shihu get here?\nI’m not sure.\nNo, I should know by now.\nLet’s think this through.\nThere was definitely a researcher in front of me.\nThe researcher was where Shihu is now.\n- I suspect you’ve been mentally manipulated.\nMental manipulation.\nTwisted thoughts.\nHallucinations and voices.\nI close my eyes.\nAnd when I open them, the hallucinations should fade.\nI open my eyes.\nI see strange teal-colored surgical room lights.\n“Ah, uh…”\nNo.\nThis isn’t right.\nThis is bad, bad, bad.\nI close my eyes and open them again.\nStill the white room.\nThe operating room.\n“Ah…?”\nThis must be a joke.\nI was just with Shihu.\nI was just outside.\nPlease.\nI close my eyes again.\nAnd open them.\nAm I in a hospital?\nNo, no, no.\nI’ve never been to a hospital.\nI’m not sick.\n“Seo Ah?”\nSomeone grabs my arm.\nWhat are you doing?\nWhat are you doing?\nDamn it, damn it, damn it.\nThis must be a dream.\nIt has to be.\nSay it’s a dream.\nThis isn’t real.\nShihu will wake me up.\nIt’s morning.\nThe sunlight will come through.\nI close my eyes and open them.\nI’m back on the ground.\nMy head is spinning, but I can clearly see the shining metal.\n“G-get the knife away.”\nIs that really a knife?\nNo, it’s a toy.\nYeah, a toy.\nPlastic. It’s plastic.\nIt’s the one Shihu and Seo Ah used to play with.\nNo, no, it can’t be touching my stomach.\nIt doesn’t hurt. It can’t hurt.\nThis is a dream. Right? It’s a dream.\n“Hey, I used drugs so it shouldn’t hurt…”\nIt doesn’t hurt.\nDon’t use a knife.\nYou’re trying to kill me.\nI’m not a monster.\nI’m not.\n“No, heheh, heh…”\nI said it hundreds of times, but no one listened.\n“I’m not a monster…”\nEven if I say it, no one believes me.\nI won’t have anyone on my side.\nMostly hostile or neutral at best.\n“Ugh…”\nI’m all alone.\nA piece of trash, an idiot.\nIt’s pitiful.\n“…”\nAnd the truth is, I am a monster.\nIf everyone else calls me a monster, then that’s what I am.\nAnd I see myself as one too.\nI think it’s time I accepted it.\nI saw it in a novel, a dragon appears as a mid-boss.\nAfter Shihu catches it, his level goes up a lot.\nHe gets good items too.\n“I…”\nWho am I?\nLogically, a tuna can can’t be alive.\nA tuna can can’t move.\n“Monster…”\nIt’s not bad.\nI’m already doomed. I’ll just die and give some experience.\n“If I die, will a good item drop?”\n“Maybe…”\nIf I’m going to do it, I’d prefer something cool.\nA dragon should do.\n“Yeah.”\nThen let’s fight!\nI’m going to fight.\nDrugs, make me a sword.\nI’m going to wield a weapon.\nI’m a sophisticated monster.\nPreparing to attack.\nReady.\nReady…\nI raise the sword and aim at the enemy.\nWho is my enemy?\nMy vision is blurry.\nBut honestly, I don’t want to fight.\nI want to go home.\nHome.\nThere’s no comfortable bed, but I’d be content just lying on the floor.\nLet’s eat something delicious.\nThere’s no TV, but I can read books.\nWould you make something delicious for me?\nNo, I’ll make it.\nDelicious food... I only know how to make scrambled eggs or ramen, but I’ll make it.\nI want to eat at home.\nWith a friend.\nA friend.\nI’m not a monster.\nI have a friend.\nI’m still a person.\nMonsters don’t have homes, but tuna cans do.\nAm I a tuna can?\nAnyway, I have a home.\nI don’t like vegetables.\nBut I like ramen with vegetables.\nI’ll cook for you.\nYou’ve probably never seen a monster cook.\n“Hey…”\n**Clink.**\nI drop the knife on the ground.\nI don’t need weapons.\n“Want some ramen? Let’s go home.”\nMy vision is blurry, but I know who’s in front of me.\nShihu.\nI barely remembered.\nMy memories are a mess, but I still believe he’s a friend.\n“I’ll cook for you…”\nI hesitantly open my arms.\nMaybe a gesture to embrace me.\nMaybe it’s just a gesture of welcome.\nLet’s make up.",

I don’t look like one, do I?\"\nIs she worried about what Cheon Yuhwa said?\nSure, if you just looked at the raw aura spilling out of her, she might seem like a fairly powerful monster.\nBut she’s not a monster.\n\"There’s no way you’re a monster.\"\n\"Really? Really?\"\nHer voice sounds desperate.\nI suddenly wonder what Cheon Yuhwa is up to.\nI’m grateful that she hasn’t interfered.\nWhen I glance to the side, I see her simply watching us, her gaze sharp and alert.\nShe doesn’t seem to have let her guard down.\n\"I can go home, right? I’m not going to suddenly turn into a monster or something?\"\n\"Yeah, that won’t happen.\"\n\"Ahaha, thank goodness. I don’t want to become a monster. I’m not going to use those drugs again, and anyway, I’m still human...\"\n\"Let’s go home.\"\nSeo Ah smiles.\nVery slowly.\nRadiantly.\nI have to protect that smile.\nI had to, no matter what.\nThe faint scent of medicine lingers in the air.\n***\nSeo Ah and I walked side by side.\nHer hand was in mine.\nIt felt a bit cold. No, very cold.\nI wondered if I should hold her hand tighter.But would that hurt her?\nInstead, I just applied a little more pressure with my fingers.\nSeo Ah said nothing, holding my hand as we walked.\nCheon Yuhwa quietly stepped aside.\nShe seemed to understand the situation to some extent.\nThe car was broken. How were we going to get home?\nThe road was silent.\nToo silent.\nIt had been so chaotic just moments ago.\nThe monsters must have been dealt with.\nI suppose Cheon Yuhwa coming to my side meant that Rena and Cheon Yuseong had already taken care of things on their end.\nWe walked.\nCracked asphalt was scattered with crumpled leaves,\nwhich rustled softly with each gust of wind.\nSeo Ah kept her head slightly lowered.\nNot once did she look at the sky as we walked.\n\"Hey,\" Seo Ah suddenly said.\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"Then...\"\nKicking at the asphalt with her toe, she spoke hesitantly.\n\"We’ll eat together, hang out... live like before, right?\"\n\"Yeah, let’s do that.\"\n\"Really?\"\nSeo Ah stopped and looked up at me.\n\"Really. I promise.\"\nSeo Ah began walking again.\nWhenever she stumbled as if she might fall, I held her hand firmly to steady her.\nI wasn’t in great shape myself,\nbut I managed to stay on my feet somehow.\nIt had been an exhausting day, but I didn’t feel tired.\nSeo Ah was beside me.\nAnd I was holding her hand.\nThe faint scent of medicine still lingered.\nIt clung to Seo Ah’s clothes.\nMedicine.\nThe medicine was still a problem.\nIf I used purification skills or some of the abilities I’d recently learned, I might be able to treat her.\nProbably.\nUsing the Saintess might also be an option.\nAnyway, it was a happy day.\nA day full of things I still didn’t fully understand,\nbut I hoped it wasn’t a dream.\nSeo Ah was here beside me.\nYeah.\nBecause Seo Ah was here.\nThud.\n\"Huh?\"\nSeo Ah pushed me away.\nWas she asking me to let go of her hand?\nWhy?\n\"Seo Ah? What’s wrong?\"\n\"Ah... it’s just... I remembered something I need to do.\"\n\"What?\"\nSeo Ah’s state changed again.\nHad I failed to completely reassure her?\nBut she hadn’t let go of my hand.\n\"I have to pay my debt. That’s the only way I can become normal again.\"\n\"...Debt?\"\nWhat was she talking about?\nSeo Ah was smiling, but she looked uneasy.\n\"I was the only one who was happy. You’ve been suffering and hurting, and I was too happy because of the drugs. That’s not right.\"\nHappy?\nNo way.\n\"I was happy alone. Constantly. So, I’ve accumulated a debt. You were covered in blood, and I was...\"\nHappiness is usually something to celebrate.\nUnder normal circumstances, it is.\nBut something about Seo Ah’s happiness was twisted.\nShe tried to pull her hand away, but I didn’t let go.\n\"So, if you think about it, it’s like there’s a spider in my head. But it’s a happy spider, and it’s raising other spiders. So there’s this happy farm of spiders. But I didn’t feed them.\"\nI could hardly make sense of what she was saying.\nThe concept of a debt made no sense.\nEven if Seo Ah had felt happiness, why did that matter?\nWas she feeling guilt over artificially induced pleasure?\n\"You haven’t accrued any debt.\"\n\"I have. I didn’t endure the pain I was supposed to... so I’m in debt.\"\nShe had suffered more than enough pain.\nFar more than any one person should endure.\n\"So, I need to... endure more pain...\"\n\"No.\"\n\"But, but... I need to pay this off to become normal again. You’d prefer me in a normal state, right?\"\nI wanted to tell her that she was fine as she was,\nbut it was clear that Seo Ah didn’t believe that herself.\nShe tried to twist her hand free again, but I stopped her.\n\"I need to be normal. This trashy body, this trashy mind, barely functioning like a zombie... it’s disgusting.\"\n\"No, it’s not...\"\n\"I saw myself in the mirror. I’m a monster, but you’re so kind that you treat me like a human.\"\n\"You’re not a monster.\"\n\"I am. Something inside me keeps screaming. It’s probably my brain.\"\nShe wouldn’t stop talking.\n\"But, but, my brain’s probably already rotten, right? Can something rotten even scream? Maybe it’s only 10% rotten? Then what am I? Rot? Screaming? Or just a tuna can? Ahaha.\"\nHer words lacked coherence.\nThey reeked of madness.\nShe was already mentally shattered.\nThough she smiled brightly, her words were abnormal.\nNo, maybe she wasn’t completely broken.\nBut even as I told myself that, I couldn’t ignore the facts.\n\"Oh, uh, sorry. Sorry. I said something weird again. You won’t hate me, right?\"\nSeo Ah looked at me with a worried expression.\n\"I don’t hate you.\"\nI don’t hate you.\nIt’s the opposite.\nI like you.\nAlthough I rarely said it out loud.\n\"...But you’re not going to let go? I told you, I have something I need to do.\"\n\"Sorry...\"\nI’ll keep holding on.\nPlease don’t go anywhere else.\n\"...Oh! Right. I owe you something too. The money I borrowed for the medicine. I didn’t pay it back. I’m sorry.\"\nMedicine?\nShe must be talking about the money she borrowed at the Academy.\n\"It’s fine. Forget about it.\"\n\"Ah...\"\nShe fidgeted uneasily, clearly still bothered by it.\nThere’s no need for her to feel that way.\nHow can I reassure her?\nWhy does Seo Ah feel guilty?\nIt doesn’t make sense.\nShe’s the biggest victim here.\nWhy?\nWhy does the victim feel guilt?\nNo matter how many times I asked myself, I couldn’t find an answer.\n\"It’s okay. Everything will be okay.\"\nThat’s all I could say.\nMaybe I should hug her.\nSeo Ah wasn’t trying to pull her hand away anymore.\nWould it be okay to hug her?\nReally?\nI just wanted to.\nAs I leaned closer toward Seo Ah, something on her neck caught my eye.\nI hadn’t noticed it earlier when I hugged her.\nThere was something there.\nNot quite a scar... words?\n\"This—\"\nThe moment I reached out to check, Seo Ah twisted away.\n\"Ah, ahhh...\"\nShe was flustered.\n\"Did you see? Did you see? Did you see it? You saw it, didn’t you? Ahhh. I hate this.\"\nThere was something there.\nSomething I felt I needed to confirm.\nBut Seo Ah didn’t want me to.\n\"I didn’t see anything.\"\n\"Liar, liar, liar. I’m not showing it to you. Not to you. Never. Just know that. Understand?\"\n\"Okay. Whatever it is, if you don’t want me to, I won’t look.\"\n\"Ah... ugh... it’s nothing! Nothing at all. It’ll disappear if I wash it. It will.\"\nSeo Ah was half-panicked.\nWhat was she so desperate to hide?\nWhat could it be?\nI had no idea.\nDisappear if she washed it?\n\"I-I’m normal. I’m just a regular person, so you don’t need to worry about me. Got it? Got it? Answer me!\"\n\"Yeah. Got it.\"\nIf Seo Ah reacted this strongly, I wouldn’t touch it.\nI was scared too.\nWhat was it?\nI didn’t want to ruin the fragile bond we had rebuilt.\nSeo Ah’s breathing was rough.\nI waited for her to calm down.\n\"...Sorry. Sorry. It’s not your fault. Sorry. Sorry. Seo Ah used to be brighter, normal, smiling purely, but now I...\"\n\"It’s fine. Even if there’s a problem, I don’t care. So don’t worry.\"\nI couldn’t expect Seo Ah to be the same as before.\nAnd I didn’t care what state she was in.\nAs long as she stayed by my side, that’s all I wanted.\n\"Really? It’s really okay?\"\n\"Yeah. Just stay by my side.\"\nNothing else mattered.\nEven if she’d changed a bit, that was okay.\nI was happy Seo Ah was here.\nI held her hand as we walked.\nThough our hands were clasped, the distance between us felt slightly wider.\nSeo Ah pulled up her collar, determined to keep whatever it was hidden.\nIf we kept talking about this, the mood would only get darker.\nI decided to break the silence.\n\"...Hey, Seo Ah, want to go stargazing? Before we head home?\"\nThe car was broken, and it’d take a while to get home anyway.\nA brief look at the sky couldn’t hurt.\n\"Stars...\"\nSeo Ah’s expression softened.\nIt seemed like she liked the idea.\nIt was a request I’d taken too long to grant.\nI remembered her hesitation before, asking if we could go stargazing at night.\nI’d said no.\nWhy did I do that?\nWhy did I go back to the Academy?\nIf only we’d stayed together from the start.\nSo even now, at least...",

      "content": "A flashlight.\nNo.\nCrackling wires.\nNo.\nA lighter.\nNo.\nStars.\nYes.\nLooking up at the sky, those must be stars.\nI'm sitting on top of an abandoned building, gazing at the stars.\nTo be honest, the idea that I enjoy stargazing is a misunderstanding.\nThe truth is, I just didn’t have anything else to do.\nThere’s nothing easier than looking up at the sky.\nThey say when people die, they become stars.\nBut that only applies to famous people, doesn’t it?\nIf I became a star, then maybe Shihu, far away, would know where I am.\nI point to the sky with my hand.\nStarlight trickles down from my fingertips.\nNot because of gravity, but because, in truth, the stars just want to be free.\nFrom the stars floating in the middle of the sky to the ones barely clinging to the horizon, flickering faintly.\n[10%]\n“I see numbers.”\n“What?”\nShihu looks at me like I’m acting strange.\nAnd he’s right.\nEven someone with no sense can tell there’s something off about me.\n“I used to see time in front of me. It was like a timer—a sort of status screen, but more of a countdown clock.”\nHe doesn’t seem to understand.\nEven stating the facts makes me sound insane.\nI get it.\n[10%]\n“But now, I see this strange percentage instead. It means I’m in debt…”\nI don’t seem to have a talent for explaining things.\nShihu still looks confused.\nHe seems troubled, probably unsure how to respond.\n“I’ve always seen it. In a way, it’s like my one and only friend. It’s been with me for as long as I can remember.”\nNo matter how I say it, it sounds strange.\nThat makes me sound like a genuinely messed-up person.\nOr maybe I’m really just mentally ill.\nWait, is that it?\nThe world’s gone mad, and I’ve just been ignoring it.\nSeeing numbers like this can’t be normal.\nIs this some overdue self-awareness?\n“Probably since I started using drugs.”\n“…I see.”\nShihu tilts his head back to look at the stars.\nThe starlight shines faintly but unceasingly.\nHe stretches his hand toward the sky, then lowers it.\nSomething glimmers faintly at his fingertips.\n“Hey, you know what?”\nI recall something I read in a book.\n“What?”\n“I read somewhere that starlight takes hundreds, even thousands of years to reach us. So, the stars we see might already be gone.”\n“Yeah, I think I read that too.”\n“So, what I’m saying is…”\n“Mm?”\nShihu turns to look at me.\n“I wanted to be a star too.”\n“What?”\n“I mean… even after I’m gone, someone could still see me.”\nThat would be nice.\nI just want someone to remember me.\n“…You’re not going anywhere,” Shihu says.\n“But now that I think about it, I don’t think it’s necessary to be remembered. I’d be satisfied just living a normal life.”\n[9%]\nAlthough, living normally doesn’t seem possible.\n“By the way, Shihu, how have you been? All this time?”\n“Me? Hmm… not good.”\n“Why?”\n“Because I couldn’t see you… Oh. About what happened back then, I’m sorry.”\n“Hm? Oh… it’s fine.”\nThe memory of our last parting isn’t a good one.\nI think Shihu suddenly attacked me.\nDid he curse at me? I can’t recall.\n“What happened back then wasn’t intentional. I’m sorry. It was because of the skill’s side effects. I should’ve apologized sooner.”\n“It’s okay. I don’t even really remember what happened.”\n“I’m sorry.”\nWas it really something worth apologizing for?\nMaybe?\nLet’s think about what Shihu said.\nAh, now I remember.\n“Oh, yeah. You asked if I’d sold my body, right?”\n“Oh, no, that— I’m so sorry.”\nHe must’ve asked because it was bothering him.\n“But, you know, asking something like that…”\nIt’s… degrading.\n“I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to ask something like that, I swear.”\nAnswer me.\nSo, did I sell my body?\nAm I trash?\n“But if I did sell myself, or act like trash… we couldn’t stay friends, right? That’d be a bit much, wouldn’t it?”\nShihu seems lost for words, his breath catching.\nBefore he can respond, I keep talking.\n“It’s okay. You don’t have to answer. Honestly, I don’t even know myself. As far as I can remember, I didn’t do anything like that. But I’m not sure. Sorry.”\nI feel his grip tighten on my hand.\nHe’s uneasy.\n“It’s fine. Everything’s fine. Really. No matter what happened, what does it matter? You’re alive. That’s enough.”\nI’m glad.\n[8%]\nNo, this isn’t good.\nIt keeps dropping.\n“We’ve seen enough stars for now. Let’s go hunt some monsters.”\nThat makes the percentage go up.\n“What? Monsters?”\n“Yeah. Because I’ve got debts to pay. The interest is piling up.”\n“I don’t understand.”\nDo you still not get it?\n“Let go of my hand.”\nI was going to go alone anyway.\nHe doesn’t let go.\n“You’re really not letting go?”\n“No.”\n“Let… go.”\n“Where are you going? I’ll come with you.”\nThere’s no need to hold hands.\nNo matter where we go.\n“Seriously, you’re not letting go?”\n“No.”\nWhy not?\nWhy won’t he let go?\nA logical reason…\nI have no idea.\nIt’d be nice if he told me, but he doesn’t seem like he will.\nSomething feels wrong.\n“My hand hurts.”\n“Sorry, I’ll hold it more gently.”\nI try twisting my hand free, but I fail.\nShihu is stronger.\n[7%]\nThe number keeps dropping.\n“…Hey, are you trying to purify me or something? Is that why you’re holding my hand?”\n“What? No, I just—”\n“I’ve told you so many times I’m fine. So why? Let go!”\nFinally, Shihu releases my hand.\n“I’m sorry, I just…”\nA distant siren wails.\nThe sirens grow louder, approaching from the distance.\nFrom up here on the building, I can see them clearly—vehicles that aren’t here for peaceful purposes.\nThere are several of them, resembling fire trucks, even armored cars.\nThe sound rings out, rising in pitch as they close in, surrounding the entire area.\nAh, I’ve heard about this before.\nWhen a truly dangerous monster causes serious damage, they deploy forces like this to handle it.\nVehicles carrying \"Awakened\" individuals to deal with the threat.They must be coming to hunt something.\nA terrifying monster.\nYes, hunting monsters.\nLuckily, this area isn’t densely populated.\nWe can tie the thing down here and wait for reinforcements.\nThat’s how these things go.\nThe sirens keep wailing, the lights flashing so brightly they don’t look like stars anymore.\nI thought the stars had fallen to the horizon, but it was just the headlights of those vehicles.\nReinforcements, huh?\nDo we need them?\nNormally, Shihu would handle it, but he’s hurt right now.\nSo, to make sure it’s dealt with properly…\nWho are they here to kill?\nMe?\nThere’s no one else but me.\nAh, this is bad.\nAll the monsters nearby are dead, so it must be me they’re coming for.\nShihu knew this would happen.\nThat’s why he held onto my hand, so I couldn’t run away.\nUsing stargazing as an excuse.\n“If you hated me that much, you could’ve just said so. There was no need to act kind and hold my hand.\nIf I was so disgusting to you, if you wanted me dead so badly because I’m such a monster, you should’ve just told me.\nI’d have done it myself. I’d have died quickly.”\nShihu says something, but I can’t hear him.\n[6%]\nThe numbers disappear.\nI’m scared.\nBlack thorns burst outward in all directions.\nThere’s no sound.\nOr maybe there is, but all I hear is a ringing in my ears.\n[20%]\nAh, I stabbed him.\nI think I stabbed him pretty hard.\nThe percentage went up a lot.\nAn attack.\nI attacked Shihu.\nI think he blocked it, but he looks like it hurt a bit.\nStill, thanks to that, I can repay some of my debt.\nClang.\n“…Ice?”\nMy shoes and the ground beneath me are frozen solid.\nAn \"Awakened\" did this.\nCheon Yuhwa.\nShe followed us to this abandoned building and has been watching.\nShe’s here to kill me.\n[23%]\nI realize there’s no point holding back when attacking.\nThey’re all enemies anyway.\nI always knew.\nIt was just wishful thinking.\nThe hope that someone might want to stay my friend.\nIf they were really a friend, they’d have come to find me long ago.\nSomeone, at least one person, would have looked for me.\nThe black thorns shoot rapidly toward Cheon Yuhwa’s neck.\nBut before they can reach her, they freeze and shatter.\n[26%]\nThe more pain I inflict, the more debt I can repay.\nThat’s right.\nThis time, I create a black wall.\nCrash.\nIt freezes again and shatters.\n[30%]\nI’ll repay the debt.\nI just have to repay it all.\nCrack.\nAn ice spear comes flying, but I block it.\nCheon Yuhwa mutters something, but I can’t hear her.\nHer face is filled with hatred.\nWhat did I do to make her so angry?\nI don’t understand.\nShe’s the one trying to kill me.\n[33%]\nI’ll repay the debt.\nThis is a great opportunity.\nIf I repay everything, I’ll be normal again.\nIf I reach 100%, I’ll be normal.\nThen I can go home.\nShihu doesn’t like me because I’m a monster.\nIf I become normal again, he’ll like me.\nThen he won’t try to kill me anymore.\nWe’ll go back to being friends.\nI’ll go home with him.\n“Hehe.”\nI’m excited.\nCheon Yuhwa yells something, but I can’t hear it.\nShe points toward Shihu.\nShihu.\nHe’s lying on the ground.\nWhat’s this?\nSomeone attacked him.\nWhat kind of terrible person would do that?\nThe world is so scary.\nBut it’s okay!\n“That’s nothing a dose won’t fix.”\nExactly.\n“In just an hour or two, the wounds will heal completely! Don’t worry about Shihu.”\nSomeone should give Shihu some medicine.\nCheon Yuhwa stares blankly at me.\n“I know because I’ve tried it before. Even if you slice someone slowly with a saw, they heal. And you know what? Now that I think about it, medicine is really amazing…”\nEven someone as useless as me can fight a strong \"Awakened\" like Cheon Yuhwa thanks to it.\nTruly, medicine is great.\nIf someone like Shihu or Cheon Yuhwa used it, wouldn’t they become even stronger?\nWhy didn’t anyone do that sooner?\n“Medicine is good…”\nWait, what was I doing again?\nRight, looking at the stars.\nThe stars are beautiful.\n“I need my dose…”\nWho was I looking at the stars with?\nShihu.\nWhere is Shihu?\n“My dose…”\nThere he is.\nBut he’s lying down.\nWho attacked him?\n…\nIt was you, you piece of trash.\nHave you forgotten what you did?\nThat’s why Shihu called for reinforcements to kill me.\nIt’s not my fault.\nI’m not normal, so it’s okay for me to do anything.\nI’m not human—more like a kind of fish.\nBut thinking about it, canned tuna tastes good.\nActually, everything tastes good.\nIf tuna isn’t frozen immediately after being caught, its meat cooks itself from its own heat.\nSo is that why my legs are still frozen?\nThey won’t move.\nThey won’t move at all.\nFrozen tuna…\nCome to think of it, I’ve never eaten fresh tuna sashimi.\nBecause, as I said, tuna cooks itself if left alone.\nSo there’s no need to prepare it. Isn’t that great?\nThat’s why we need ice.\nI’m frozen.\n“Haha… haha…”\nThe stars are so bright it makes my head spin.\nHuh?\nWhat?\nThose aren’t stars.\nThey’re the lights of a surgery room.\nOr maybe someone wants sashimi and is about to cut me up.\nBut I’m just a person who likes canned tuna.\nSashimi is a little scary.\n“I’m sorry. I’m not in my right mind. I’m a bit out of it, but you understand, right? Thank you. So please, just this once, let Seo Ah go. She’s kind, and good, and innocent. Please, just this one time.”",

      "content": "I’m not in my right mind.\nBut I still believe I’m human.\nUnless you plan to strip every right away from mentally unstable people, isn’t this treatment too harsh?\nWorse than a stray dog.\nA dog.\nBeing a dog would be better.\nDidn’t everyone raise a dog at least once when they were kids?\nAnyone want to adopt a Seo Ah?\nAh, no—more like a dog without a leash.\nBut one that still wears a collar.\nI remember trying to raise one like that and failing.\nIt feels like something similar to that.\nIf you ask whether a dog can handle explosives, the answer is yes.\nBoom.\nThe building explodes entirely.\nThe \"can of tuna\" perched on top comes crashing down.\n[37%]\nThere’s no real retaliation.\nCheon Yuhwa is using her skill to protect Shihu.\nThud.\nI fell.\nThanks to body reinforcement, I’m not hurt.\nI surround my body with mana to harden it.\nI’ve learned not to release this barrier—last time I did, I got skewered by a sword.\nI need to keep it up at all times.\nThe explosions follow a similar principle.\nInstead of creating attacking thorns, I form a sphere.\nIf you keep inflating a sphere made of mana, eventually the surrounding area explodes.\nWatching them send specialized vehicles to capture me, I had a thought:\nMaybe I’m pretty strong.\nThis is no different from a boss raid.\nDoesn’t that make me at least a mid-boss?\nIf I’m a boss, I should be able to use attacks worthy of one.\nThat much would be fair.\nA dog.\nA wolf.\nNo, something else.\nI think I’ve become a similar kind of monster.\nA creature that only looks vaguely human.\nTo keep the dog from running, they tie it down.\nDrive stakes into the ground and leash it.\nA hammer?\nThat looks nice.\n“How about a giant hammer?”\nI create a weapon, making it massive.\nIt doesn’t matter how heavy it is—I can’t feel the weight.\nThe hammer’s head grows as large as a building, but the handle remains relatively thin.\nF = M * A\nForce equals mass times acceleration.\nHere, mass is replaced by mana.\nWhat a nonsensical world.\nIt must be because this is like a novel.\nThe laws of physics are completely twisted.\nI slam the hammer down.\nBoom!\nCrash, crash, crash…\nI grind the debris of the destroyed building into dust.\nFragments scatter everywhere.\nCheon Yuhwa is nowhere to be seen.\nOh, there she is.\nShe’s put some distance between us.\nIt seems like she’s hesitant to attack me directly.\n“I won’t let it happen like last time,” she says.\nRena must be nearby.\nWhich means someone could appear behind me at any moment.\nI’ve learned not to drop my barrier—it leads to immediate penetration.\nPierced, pierced, pierced.\nThe smell of blood was unbearable.\n[57%]\nI remember being stabbed by a sword.\nRight.\nThere’s no weapon as effective as that.\n“This time, it’s going to be a massive sword.”\nInstead of a hammer, I create a giant sword.\nThe blade is absurdly disproportionate to the hilt.\nI swing it.\nBoom, boom, boom, boom!\nForget air resistance—it tears through space itself.\n“This doesn’t even make sense,” I mutter.\nEverything in the sword’s path turns to ruins.\nStructures are reduced to dust.\nIt’s less a sword and more a massive black rectangular prism.\nI swing it again.\nThis isn’t the kind of attack a little ice can block.\nCheon Yuhwa knows that too—that’s why she’s keeping her distance.\nDoes she have a movement skill?\nBoom!\nA shockwave erupts.\n[68%]\n“My head… feels strange.”\nIs it because of the shockwaves?\nNo.\nThe effects of the drug are wearing off.\nI can feel it.\nThis peculiar, unpleasant sensation.\n“How much time… How much time is left?”\nOf course, I can’t use this power forever.\nThe accumulated drug effects must’ve lasted for a thousand hours by now.\nI feel horrible.\nEmergency stash in my pocket?\nGone.\n“What time is it?”\n[68%]\nGive me the timer.\nWhy is my status window so limited in its functions?\nThe ringing in my ears grows louder.\nDiscomfort crawls up my body.\nI need to resolve this quickly.\nI swing the sword down.\nBoom, boom, boom, boom, boom.\nAm I even swinging this by my own will?\nWhy am I wielding the sword again?\nTo become normal.\nSomehow, swinging it makes the percentage go up.\n[74%]\nStarlight flickers.\nAnd then it grows brighter.\nBeams of light launch toward me from the horizon.\nNot shooting stars—missiles, or maybe magic.\nWho else would be hit by such weapons but me?\nThat’s why they kept their distance.\nSo they wouldn’t be caught in the attack.\n“…What did I even do wrong…”\nBoom!\nI raise a mana shield to block it.\nIt’s less a shield and more of a dome.\nThis is why they don’t use modern weapons much—spending a fortune on them only to have someone like me block them effortlessly.\nCrash.\nAt this point, I think my eardrums are completely shot.\nI can feel the shockwaves, but I can’t hear a thing.\nThis kind of attack would’ve vaporized an ordinary person—or even a tank.\nWhy do they want me dead so badly?\n- You’ve nearly exhausted your supply.\nI remember my last conversation with the doctor.\n- Unfortunately…\n- If it were going to work, it would’ve succeeded by now.\n- It’s over.\n- I underestimated Seo Ah. That’s my failure.\n- If we had used pure solution from the start, this wouldn’t have happened.\n“I didn’t fail.”\nWhatever it is, I can’t afford to fail.\nNo matter what the doctor intended.\nI refuse to be left as a failure.\nThat much, at least, cannot happen.\nPlease, give me a reason to live.\nTell me I’ve lived a life of value, even in some small way.\nDon’t tell me I’ve become this for nothing.\nI need to believe I’ve done this for something worthwhile.\n- Well done, Seo Ah. From here on…\nWhen I came to, I had already killed the doctor.\nThough, somehow, I feel like he’s still alive somewhere.\n***\nConcentrated fire.\nThe bombardment continued, one strike after another.\nAmidst the dense smoke, a black sphere emerged.\n“That must be the source of the sudden surge in monster activity.”\n“What… is that?”\nThe massive trail left by a clump of mana passing through.\nThe area, already a ruin, had turned into an even greater wasteland.\n“Don’t get too close. We’ll provide support from a distance. The 'Awakened' will handle the frontlines.”\n“And the people already fighting over there…?”\n“Probably the 'Awakened' who arrived after hearing the reports. Either way, we keep our distance.”\nThe black sphere didn’t seem to have taken any significant damage.\nWaiting for the 'Awakened' to handle things had become the military’s standard tactic.\nBut there wasn’t much choice.\nIf the monster was too strong, leaving it to the 'Awakened' was the most efficient approach.\n“Did you see that earlier? Swinging a sword the size of a building?”\n“Yes.”\nNo one wanted to get close to that.\n“To pull off something like that, it must have strength equivalent to launching rockets. The main body looked humanoid, but there’s no way it’s human.”\n“There’s been an increase in humanoid monsters lately.”\n“Ah, that’s… You know this is near an experimental facility, right?”\n“I heard it was a testing area.”\nA government site for experiments involving monsters.\n“They say they’ve been capturing 'Awakened' and experimenting on them.”\n“That’s real?!”\n“Yeah, it’s real.”\nSilence.\nWe wait for the order to fire again.\n“So that thing, too… from the experimental facility?”\n“There’s been a string of incidents near testing zones lately. Those in the know can put two and two together. I’ve seen them transporting monsters in vehicles… That thing’s no human.”\n“I never thought the government would go that far.”\n“That’s why a lot of the weaker 'Awakened' keep their abilities hidden these days.”\n“Really?”\n“Of course. It’s better that way. If you don’t have anything to back you up and enroll in the academy, you’ll end up like those guys—fighting on the frontlines before anyone else. Even fully grown adults get dragged into these fights all over the place.”\nIt was easy to envy the 'Awakened,' but their reality wasn’t always desirable.\nBeing exploited under the guise of being humanity’s only hope seemed like too high a price.\n“But still, don’t they seem cool, like the protagonists of a novel or comic?”\n“Dragged off to experiments. Different genre entirely. It’s not a hero story…”\n“Oh, look, the 'Awakened' have arrived.”\nThe 'Awakened' moved alongside the military forces.\nI heard one of them was an academy professor.\nApparently, their students borrowed a vehicle for this mission.\n“They’ll handle it just fine.”\n“What is that? Some kind of summoning spell?”\nFrom the ground, enormous arms rose up, attempting to crush the black sphere.\nThey looked like they were trying to smash the sphere into the concrete floor.\n“A monster. A total monster.”\nA battle beyond human comprehension had begun.\nHere, a mere soldier was nothing more than an extra.\nHolding position was enough.\n“Whoa, is that a beam? Could it reach us here…?”\n“Looks more like spikes.”\nThe giant hand was pierced by black spikes and shattered.\nFrom a distance, the battle looked like an entertaining spectacle.\nBut it was hard to fully enjoy when your life might be on the line.\n“Whoa, there’s more coming! How many arms does that thing have?”\nFour or five arms rose from the ground, trying to crush the black sphere again.\nIt looked even more intense through binoculars.\n“What is that? Giant plants… and ice? There’s so much going on.”\n“Yes.”\nHuge tree trunks grew, as if they were about to turn the concrete into a forest.\nWhoever was doing this must be a skilled 'Awakened.'\n“But I’ve got a bad feeling. Forcing things like that usually leads to trouble.”\n“You mean the black sphere?”\nNow lightning was striking from the sky.\nLights of various sizes flashed, accompanied by a storm of spells.\nEven from a distance, the explosions echoed loudly.\n“It’s like in games, you know, boss battles…”\n“Yes?”\n“There’s always a second phase, right? You think you’ve won, but it’s just getting started.”\n“Don’t jinx it. We don’t even know what that thing is, but… we should be fine, right?”\nHaha.\nA weak chuckle escaped.\n“They should be able to handle it. If they capture it, they’ll hand it over to the government anyway. Not our problem.”\nNot our problem.\nAfter all, we couldn’t get involved in a fight between monsters like this.",

I’ve held on until now!”\nI don’t even know who I’m yelling at.\n“If I disappear… If I disappear…”\nPeople will regret it.\nBut will they really?\n“…Shihu…”\nWould he be sad?\nOr relieved that the obstacle is gone?\nShihu has to exist for there to be a happy ending.\nHe’s the protagonist who will bring peace to the world, isn’t he?\n“I just need to stop using the drugs. I’m sorry!”\nI’ve used far too much until now.\nIs this my punishment?\nI don’t know what’s happening, but it’s terrifying.\n“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry! But I still have hope—”\nDo I?\nLight pierces through the black dome.\nThe barrier is breached.\nCracks widen, and the dome starts to split apart.\nAnd then, someone appears.\n“…Shihu?”\n“Yes. It’s me, Seo Ah.”\nThe hand wielding his sword is trembling.\nHe had just risen from being collapsed moments ago.\nThere’s no way his body is in good condition.\n“Shihu, Shihu, why are you trying to kill me? Please don’t.”\n“I’m not. We didn’t call those people here.”\n“Th-then… I attacked you…”\nI remember attacking him recklessly.\n“It was a misunderstanding.”\n“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”\n“It’s fine. Calm down. I’ve already told them to stop attacking.”\n“Really?”\n“Yes.”\n[99%]\nAh. No wonder the number hasn’t increased further.\nIt used to go up by 1% every time I got attacked, but now it’s stopped just shy of 100%.\n“Don’t attack anymore, okay?”\nIf I do, it’ll hit 100%.\nI thought I was repaying my debt, thought I was becoming normal.\nWhy did I think that?\nI don’t understand at all.“It’s fine. Calm down.”\nCalm down.\nI try to calm myself.\nHow?\n“Oh, oh, right. That purification skill—you have it, don’t you? Can you use it? I’m kind of in a dangerous situation here.”\n“Purification? N-now?”\nShihu replies hesitantly.\n“Yes. Can’t you?”\n“Well, I’m sorry. My body’s not in great shape. I probably can’t.”\nHe’s bleeding.\nShihu is clutching the wound on his chest with the hand not holding his sword.\n“Oh, right, you’re hurt. I’m sorry. I keep asking for impossible things and being a burden.”\n“Don’t worry about me. Let’s just get out of here first.”\n“Okay!”\nThe dome-shaped barrier is almost completely destroyed.\nThe continuous attacks have filled the air with thick smoke.\nGrabbing Shihu’s hand, I start running.\nThere must be a safe place somewhere.\nBang. Bang, bang, bang, bang!\nThe sound of gunfire rings out from somewhere.\nAnd the one hit—\nIs me.\n[100%]\nHa.\nThe number has reached its limit.\nSo, what happens now?\nFirst, it hurts.\nIt feels like something is bursting inside me.\nBreath scattered in chaotic fragments.\nHow did it come to this?\nI was nothing special.\nI didn’t do anything to deserve this.\nI wanted to be someone great, someone important, but I never became that.\nI just want human warmth.\nBecause I’m not a monster—I’m human.\n[System shutdown in 3 seconds.]\nI’m sorry.\nI’m sorry.\nI’m sorry.\n[System shutdown in 2 seconds.]\nBut I don’t want to die.\nI want to live.\nI will stay here.\n[System shutdown in 1 second.]\nShutdown (euthanasia).\nSo that’s what this is.\nShihu is holding my hand.\n“Ahaha.”\nI see a memory from when I was young.\nWas it when I was very sick?\nShihu was by my side—\n[System shutdown.]\n***\n“Seo Ah?”\nShihu had also been shot in the leg.\nSomeone had fired recklessly.\nBut that didn’t matter now.\n“…Seo Ah? Hey?”\nPlease let this be a mistake.\nLet this be a hallucination caused by blood loss.\nHe shook her, but she didn’t wake up.\nHe needed to stop the bleeding.\nBut the wounds were in a difficult area.\nAt the academy, they taught that even a single hit to this region could be fatal.\nWith rapid-fire shots, the damage was overwhelming.\n“……”\nPain he had momentarily forgotten came rushing back.\nShihu tried to lift Seo Ah, to carry her, but his leg throbbed in agony.\nHe couldn’t walk.\nHe staggered, falling alongside her.\nIn the background, Cheon Yuhwa was shouting, fighting whoever had fired the gun.\nThe situation was falling apart.\nEven among the \"Awakened,\" internal discord had broken out, with someone from the military intervening.\n- Who gave the order to fire?!\nA faint voice could be heard shouting from a distance.\nNo, there was no way Seo Ah was dead.\nLast time, he’d thought she was dead too, but she had survived.\nHe had to stop the bleeding.\nEven if he didn’t know how, he had to try.\nRemoving his shirt, he started applying pressure.\nAs he loosened Seo Ah’s clothes to bandage her, scars came into view.\nThen he noticed something.\nThe scars weren’t random—they were letters.\n“Canned tuna.”\nIt was written across her lower abdomen.\n“…Oh, damn it…”\nThat’s why she didn’t want to show her skin.\nThat’s why she called herself \"canned tuna.\"\nWhat had she been through?\nAll Shihu could remember was sharing a can of tuna with her once.\nWhy had it come to this?\n“Ah… ah…”\nThe writing wasn’t limited to one area.\nIt was everywhere.\nIt was cruel.\nBut more pressing than the scars was the blood still pouring out.\nHer blood was thicker than usual—likely a side effect of the drugs.\nThe thought briefly crossed Shihu’s mind.\nRecovery medicine.\nThey’d called it that once.\nShe needed the drugs.\nDrugs.\nHe had a few emergency doses with him, just in case he ever ran into Seo Ah again and they became necessary.\nDid he bring them?\nHe searched his pockets.\nHis fingers found something similar to a pen.\n“Ah.”\nIt was a syringe.\nBut it was broken.\nThe contents had leaked out during the intense fighting.\nShe had to live.\nShe had to survive.\nThe battle around them continued.\nSeo Ah had fallen, but for some reason, the fight hadn’t stopped.\nHe needed to protect her.\nHe needed to get her to safety.\nTo a place where she could be treated.\n“I have to… get us out of here.”\nHis vision blurred.\nHe’d already been forcing himself to stay conscious for too long.\nHe was at the very limits of his mental endurance.\nHe’d pushed himself to the brink, but there was nothing left to give.\nAgain.\nAgain.\nHe needed to get up, to carry her.\nThere had to be people who could help.\nBut right now, he was the one who needed to be carried.\nThud.\nHe fell to his knees.\nAll around him were collapsed concrete and steel beams from the battle.\nTap, tap.\nSmall stones tumbled down.\nDust fell from above.\nA massive section of the building’s wreckage began to collapse.\nHe needed to stop it.\nBut he had no strength left.\nHe couldn’t even grip his sword properly, let alone fight.\nHe tried to use his skills, but his mana was completely depleted.\nEverything was gone.\nEven passing out wouldn’t be surprising at this point.\nHe had used up every ounce of power he had.\nSo how?\nHow was he supposed to protect Seo Ah?\nHe wrapped his arms around her and braced himself for the impact.\nCould he shield her from the falling debris with his back?\nBoom!\n***\n\"If anything happens in the future…\"\nA faded memory from childhood.\nA recollection so blurry, it’s hard to know if it’s accurate.\n\"Tell me. We’re friends, after all.\"\nThe moment Shihu and Seo Ah truly began to grow closer.\n\"I’ll protect you.\"\nSo, don’t worry.\n\"Really?\"\nSeo Ah asked again.\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Then I’ll protect you too, Shihu.\"\nShe smiled brightly.\n\"So, if anything hard happens, tell me!\nWith complete confidence.\nConfidence that came from who knows where.\n\"I’ll take care of everything.\"\nHer chest puffed out, as if demanding trust.\nThat carefree smile, full of sunshine.\nThe battle had become far too chaotic.\nCheon Yuhwa bit her lip.\nIt should have ended with simply retrieving Seo Ah, but the military had intervened.\nLikely due to the recent monster escape in the area.\nShe had let her guard down because an academy professor was among her group.\nBut those soldiers had been trained to kill anything that even looked like a monster.\nSeo Ah’s human-like appearance didn’t matter to them—they shot first and asked questions later.\nThen Rena, observing from a distance, lost control, and everything spiraled into chaos.\nNow, indiscriminate gunfire, rogue \"Awakened,\" and other parties with unclear motives had turned the battlefield into a mess.\nIt was impossible to distinguish friend from foe.\nShihu had also been shot.\nCheon Yuhwa wanted to help him, but she was being attacked by another \"Awakened.\"\nThe reason? Unknown.\nBoom!\nA building collapsed under the swing of a giant sword wielded by one of the intervening \"Awakened.\"\nThe debris was falling right where Shihu was.\nShe had to stop it.\n“Mana depletion?”\nShe couldn’t use her skills.\nShe couldn’t stop it.\nCrash!\nThe sound of the building’s wreckage colliding.\nCheon Yuhwa averted her eyes.\nShihu must have stopped it somehow.\nFor now, she had to focus on the immediate battle.\nThat took priority.\nWithout mana, it was down to pure physical ability.\nBut something felt wrong.\nHer mana couldn’t have run out completely.\nThen the battlefield grew strangely quiet.\nIt seemed like everyone was experiencing the same issue—none of their skills were working.\nIt was as if all \"Awakened\" abilities had been sealed.\n“Where is everyone looking…?”\nAll eyes were fixed on the spot where Shihu should have been crushed under the debris.\nBut there was no wreckage.\nNo Shihu.\nInstead, a young girl hovered in the air.\nBranches, resembling antlers, sprouted from her head, shimmering like they were made of mana.\nNow she understood where all the mana had gone.\nIt had been absorbed—every last trace in the area.\nAll the mana in the vicinity had been drawn to that girl.\nThe air felt unnaturally clear.\nAir devoid of mana.\nIt was eerily fresh, unnervingly so.\n“A dragon.”\nOne of the nearby \"Awakened\" spoke, breaking the silence.\n“What?”\n“That’s a dragon. A dragon! This is why dragon hunts are so difficult.”\nShe couldn’t believe it.\nIt didn’t look human, but calling it a dragon seemed like a stretch.\n“Explain clearly.”\n“Mana consumption… Students like you wouldn’t know about it. It’s a skill dragons use—mana absorption. Don’t worry, the mana will return soon. Just hold out until then. Even a dragon can’t handle this many of us… We can take it down.”\nA dragon.\nA dragon had consumed the mana.",

      "content": "“This should be far enough.”\nThe doctor sat atop a wrecked car.\nIt was the vehicle Shihu’s group had arrived in, now destroyed by the monster’s attack.\n“Why is a director from the academy in a place like this?”\nCheon Yuseong’s voice carried suspicion.\nThe sudden appearance had initially made him cautious, thinking the doctor might be an enemy, but after confirming their identity as a director from the academy, it seemed less strange.\nGiven that even professors had come, why not a director?\nHowever, Yuseong still couldn’t figure out why the director was here.\n“And what about you, Yuseong? Why are you here?”\n“You know my name?”\n“I remember most of the students’ names.”\n“Well then, Director, do you have any plans to help? The students are in danger. Though I don’t have much hope in the academy… you are a director, after all.”\nThe doctor held a specialized telescope.\nThe lens allowed them to perceive mana flows.\n“And why are you hiding here instead of fighting, Yuseong?”\n“I’m keeping watch, just in case someone tries to sneak in, like you.”\n“Well, let’s just say I’m here for a similar reason.”\n“What could you possibly need to watch for?”\nYuseong’s tone remained skeptical.\nThe doctor looked through the telescope at the battlefield.\n“See for yourself. It’s faster that way.”\nBoom.\nA shockwave from the battlefield rippled outward.\nThen, a strange sensation followed—an eerie lethargy.\n“Mana…?”\nThe mana in the air had diminished.\nThrough the specialized telescope, the doctor saw a surprisingly clear view.\nNo mana was visible—everything had been absorbed into a single point.\n“A widespread mana depletion.”\n“What is going on?”\n“When a dragon appears, this tends to happen. They absorb all the mana in the area to gather power.”\n“And the people over there…?”\n“They’ll be fine. Among them are dragon hunters.”\n“Did you call these people here?”\nThe doctor didn’t answer.\nCheon Yuseong had no idea what was really going on.\n“This reminds me of the past.”\n“What?”\n“There was a time before monsters, gates, and dungeons. A peaceful era without so-called ‘Awakened.’”\nThe doctor continued speaking, ignoring whether Yuseong responded.\n“A time when we didn’t live under the curse of mana. Air so clean it covered everything—just like now. Though this is temporary, it used to be the norm.”\n“What are you trying to say?”\nHearing mana referred to as a “curse” was a first for Yuseong.\nHe realized the academy’s leadership might be even more unhinged than he thought.\n“Ah, do you know about Shihu’s purification skill?”\n“Why bring that up now?”\n“In some ways, it’s similar. It absorbs harmful things in its vicinity. But it’s nothing compared to how a dragon devours mana.”\n“So you’re saying the dragon… is doing a good thing? Because the air is clean?”\nAs he listened, Yuseong began preparing for battle.\nAlthough the mana depletion didn’t directly affect him due to his distance from the dragon, it had drained significantly, and he needed time to recover.\nPreparation was key.\nHe had been keeping watch for this very reason—to catch people like the doctor.\nUnlike his twin sister Cheon Yuhwa, Yuseong wasn’t particularly powerful.\nBut there was one thing he was better at: patience.\nThe longer he prepared, the more devastating his attacks could become.\nHe couldn’t match his sister’s combat prowess head-on, but with enough time, he could surpass her—at least once.\n“Seo Ah, Shihu, and even you… you all need healing. What we call ‘Awakening’ is just a polished term for a disability. In that sense, the academy is more like a hospital ward.”\nNot exactly what you’d expect a director to say.\n“And before I’m a director, I’m a doctor. A head physician, in fact. Even non-Awakened individuals are patients. Almost no one in this world escapes mana’s influence.”\nEnrolling Seo Ah in the academy wasn’t much different from admitting her to a hospital.\nThe academy was the largest and freest ward.\nA psychiatric institution for those who deluded themselves into thinking they were heroes.\nEven the academy itself must have stood for something.\nA C, Advanced Care.\nManaging \"Awakened.\"\nA D, Advanced Detention.\nDetaining \"Awakened.\"\nE M Y, Effective Monitoring of Youth.\nKeeping an effective watch on young \"Awakened.\"\nThe academy existed to control the \"Awakened.\"\nThe doctor didn’t particularly like this deceptive institution.\nIn a time before the \"Awakened,\" such things hadn’t been necessary.\n“The day no more ‘Awakened’ are born into this world… that will be the day healing is complete.”\n“So, you’re a villain too.”\nYuseong hefted his weapon—a massive, mana-infused blade.\nBy now, it resembled a cannon more than a sword.\nThe moment it fired, the mana would obliterate the doctor.\n“Do you know why so many monsters are being captured and locked away? To make weapons of war? Or for some mysterious experiments?”\nUnbothered, the doctor continued.\n“Do you know the real reason?”\n“What you said earlier wasn’t entirely false.”\nThe doctor gazed at the battlefield through the telescope.\nBlack beams of light shot out in all directions.\nIf not for the smoke and mist, the view would have been clearer.\nBut this was the best they could see from their current distance.\n“The fundamental goal is simple: to eliminate mana from this world.”\n“That’s ridiculous…”\n“Mana, monsters, ‘Awakened’—all gone. A world without them. I know you’ve longed for it. Your sister might be a more exceptional ‘Awakened,’ but you are far more suited to lead your family.”\nGathering information about students was standard protocol—for effective monitoring.\n“Returning to a normal world is a goal I share. But I don’t believe any means can justify that end.”\n“The purification devices are nearly complete. Once mass-produced, this chaotic fighting will disappear. The strange skills that defy human comprehension will vanish as well. Surely you learned at the academy that gates don’t open in areas devoid of mana.”\n“Even so…!”\nEliminating mana was one thing.\nBut experimenting on humans was clearly inhumane.\n“If you’re concerned about the methods, know that most of the questionable steps have already been completed. The project is entering its final stages.”\n“What exactly are you proposing?”\n“I’m offering you the chance to work with us.”\nThe doctor’s voice was calm and inviting.\n“Work?”\nYuseong was caught off guard by the unexpected offer.\n“A mana-depleted ‘Awakened’ is utterly useless. Wouldn’t it be better for you to have a stable job?”\n“What kind of work? I’m not exactly useful for much.”\n“The government recently established a department for managing the aftermath of mana removal. Your talents will be invaluable there. It would also reflect well on your family.”\nThe age of the \"Awakened\" was ending.\nThe doctor faced no opposition to their plan.\n“I see… quite the story. If my friends weren’t fighting for their lives over there, I might have enjoyed this conversation more. And that dragon over there… that’s Seo Ah, isn’t it? I couldn’t see clearly, but this is your doing, isn’t it?”\nYuseong raised his sword again, the mana he had been charging now powerful enough to obliterate everything around him.\n“So, will you play the righteous hero? I assure you, joining me would better serve any justice you seek.”\nThe doctor spoke confidently, certain that the era of the \"Awakened\" was coming to an end.\n“……”\nYuseong hesitated.\nWhat was the right moral choice?\nBut then, he’d never lived by moral principles.\nThat was something people like Shihu did.\nHe could feign righteousness, but he couldn’t truly empathize with it.\n“Shihu failed. Playing the hero changes nothing.”\n“How many others have you made this offer to?”\n“Among the students, you’re the first.”\nThe doctor stepped down from the wrecked car, walking toward Yuseong and extending a hand.\nConfident it would be accepted.\n“…I’ll accept your offer. Looking forward to working together.”\nYuseong shook the doctor’s hand.\nBoom!\nIt sounded like fireworks, but it was just the distant roar of explosions on the battlefield.",

Are you okay?”\nCheon Yuhwa came running toward him.\n“I’m fine.”\nHe wasn’t fine.\n“More importantly, I need to get close to Seo Ah…”\n“The others are calling her a dragon now. Do you still think of her as your friend?”\n“I can save her.”\n“Save her? You should save yourself first. Your condition is serious. You need to retreat and get treated.”\nCheon Yuhwa grabbed Shihu’s arm, trying to pull him away.\nFrom her perspective, Shihu was already critically injured.\nShe couldn’t allow him to fight any longer.\n“No. I have to save Seo Ah.”\n“…How?”\n“If I can just make contact, I can activate my skill. I’ll bring her back to normal.”\nThere was no breaking Shihu’s resolve.\n“No chance of giving up?”\n“None.”\n“Then, if you’re going to be that stubborn…”\nCheon Yuhwa let out a long sigh.\nThere was no time for a pointless argument.\nShihu gripped his sword tightly.\nIf she tried to stop him, he was ready to fight her too.\n“…I’ll help you. What do you need?”\nShe released his arm.\nThankfully, Cheon Yuhwa was an ally.\n***\nA bad ending.\nIt feels that way.\nWhat was the right choice?

It must have been so hard for you.”\nAt least I can say something like this before the end.\nI’m glad I managed to say it while I’m still somewhat myself.\nMy body feels heavy.\nMy mind is unraveling.\nShihu’s hand rests on my shoulder.\nHe looks sad, but he’s smiling.\n“I’m glad I got to be your friend.”\n“…Me too.”\nShihu replies.\nYeah.\nSo this is goodbye.\nSaying farewell makes me feel a bit melancholic.\nBut at least I’m saying it while I’m still myself.\n“We took the long way around.

      "content": "“No.”\nI shook off his hand just as the word “purification” began to escape his lips.\n“Shihu, you’ll die.”\nYour body’s already weak. If you force something like that, it’ll be disastrous.\n“You can’t die.”\nI know you’re already pushing yourself too hard. You’re too kind. Even after everything, you’re still trying to save me. But what’s the point if you die in the process?\n“...And yet, you’re the one always ready to die so easily.”\nShihu’s voice was quiet, but I could sense the anger in it.\n“I-I don’t want to die either. But things keep getting worse. At this point, it’s just better that I die, but you… you’re different.”\nBoom.\nThe ground shook as monsters stomped closer, their growls echoing in the air. They were the ones that emerged from the gate I just opened.\nEven the awakened who had been attacking me turned their attention to the monsters. For the first time in a long while, we had a moment without interference.\n“What do you mean, ‘different’?”\n“Huh?”\n“I don’t want to live either.”\n“What?”\nI never expected to hear that from Shihu. Aren’t you supposed to be the one who never gives up? The protagonist of this story?\n“You have to be here.”\n“W-What? Me?”\nYou need me?\n“It’s better if I die and you survive.”\n“W-What are you talking about? Someone like me living is worse than—”\n“Do you hate me?”\nHate you? If I hated you, would I have done all this?\n“No. I don’t hate you. If anything, I like you.”\n“Yeah. I like you more.”\nMy mind went blank. What is Shihu even trying to say?\n“Ah… but I can’t go back to how I was. The Seo Ah you like isn’t here anymore.”\n“No. No matter your state, I like you.”\n“Huh? Get a grip, Shihu. I don’t know what you mean by ‘like,’ but I’m not worth this. If you’re doing this out of obligation, you don’t need to.”\nShihu is kind. I was the one who misunderstood because of how messed up I’ve become. Maybe if it weren’t for the drugs, I wouldn’t have ended up like this.\n“No, it’s not obligation… I just like you. I’ve wanted to say it for a long time. You have to live. That’s just how it is.”\n“G-Get a hold of yourself. Stop talking nonsense.”\nNo. This isn’t right. It can’t be.\nThe binding spell weakened. I pushed Shihu away, putting distance between us. Normally, he’d catch up in an instant. But this time, it was different.\n“Don’t do this. You’ll die.”\n“I don’t care.”\nSuddenly, memories of all the things I’d done to him flashed through my mind. I’d stabbed him, hurt him countless times. It wouldn’t be strange if he thought I hated him. Maybe he even thought I wanted him dead.\nNo. That’s not true. None of it was intentional. All of it was because of my selfishness.\nI know Shihu is willing to risk his life to save me. But no matter what we do here, it’s hopeless. His body is a wreck, and I’m turning into… something dragon-like.\n“Even if I live because of you… what’s the point if you’re not here? I’ll just be a monster. Do you know what people think of me? They say all I need is a can of tuna to keep me fed. You’re the only one who still sees me as human.”\nShihu hesitated. He must have realized that simply purifying me wouldn’t solve anything. So there’s only one option left: to let me go.\n“...But if you disappear, then I…”\nShihu’s hands trembled.\n“No! You’ll be fine without me. You’re strong, talented, kind, hardworking. You were never meant to be stuck in a place like this with someone like me.”\n“It was all because of you.”\n“Me?”\n“Everything I worked for, everything I became… it was all for you. I tried to be good because I wanted you to see me that way. I became diligent because of you. I could only do it because of you.”\nI was the reason for Shihu’s growth? Was that true?\n“...Yeah. You worked hard. You really did.”\n“I…”\nShihu staggered. The fact that he was even standing seemed like a miracle.\nLet’s think rationally. Shihu isn’t just the character I once read about in a novel. He’s changed. He’s not that person anymore.\nHe doesn’t want me to die. He doesn’t want me to disappear. The protagonist of this story truly wants that.\nBut it’s too late now.\n[Process Complete.]\n“I really like you, Shihu.”\n***\nSeo Ah smiled.\nShe said she liked me.\nI can’t let her say something like that and then disappear.\nI know now that purification was the wrong choice. Leaving Seo Ah alone would be cruel in its own way.\nIt was a lapse in judgment, driven by my deteriorating condition.\nBut Shihu still had one method left.\nA skill he had learned while capturing Lee Yurim’s younger sister.\n[Forced Transfer]\nIn essence, it’s teleportation. It moves the target to a pre-designated location.\nAfter kidnapping Lee Yuna, Lee Yurim’s sister, I used this skill a few more times.\nThe destination for the transfer was…\nA kind of prison.\nSince using it after kidnapping Yuna, it had become almost exclusively a combat skill.\nIt’s a place where even a dragon could be confined.\nA dragon would be too large to transfer, but Seo Ah’s size made it possible.\nSeo Ah’s eyes gleamed.\nThe horns made of mana seemed to grow even larger.\nShe was clearly being consumed by the dragon, nearly entirely devoured by it.\nI could feel the flow of mana.\nShe might be about to use Mana Devourer again.\nThere were no options left.\n\"[Forced Transfer].\"\nAnd Seo Ah vanished.\nGulp.\nBlood surged up my throat.\nFortunately, I managed to use the vast amount of mana in the surroundings.\nThe consumption of my life force was minimal.\nBut even so, I’d reached my limit.\nStill, I’m glad Seo Ah said she liked me.\nI could hear tinnitus.\nShihu sat dazed on a pile of concrete.\nLying down might be a more accurate description.\nThe battle ended only after the gate was sealed.\nThe dragon was killed.\nAt least, that’s the official version.\n“Shihu.”\n“Yeah.”\nHis head throbbed with pain.\n“Let’s go. We need to get you to the academy and get treatment—”\n“Lena.”\nHer silver hair was dulled by dirt and dust. She must have fought hard.\n“What?”\n“I’m not going.”\nThere’s no reason to attend the academy anymore.\nPerhaps there hadn’t been a reason for a long time.\nI’d already gained everything I could from it.\n“I’m sorry about Seo Ah… I really am. There were so many things I wanted to say to her too…”\n“Yeah.”\nIt’s regrettable.\nBut it’s not over yet.\nNot yet.\nI imprisoned Seo Ah.\nIn a faraway prison.\nI never thought I’d use the transfer skill on her.\n“Still, you need to get treated.”\n“Don’t worry about it.”\nHe closed his eyes.\nHe planned to rest for just a moment.\n“…It’s sad that we won’t see Seo Ah anymore, but still…”\n“No.”\nI’ll see her again.\nAnd one day, things will return to how they were.\nPurification is certainly dangerous.\nUsing it without a last-resort skill like Final Bastion, even in perfect condition, carries huge risks.\nAbove all, the penalties for me are too severe.\n“...No?”\nEveryone thinks Seo Ah is dead.\nNo matter how you look at it, that’s the situation.\n“Probably.”\nIf that’s the case, this is an opportunity.\n“…You’re not in good shape. Let’s go together. Quickly.”\n“…”\n“Come on, okay?”\nLena helped Shihu up. His vision was blurry.\n“What about the others?”\n“I don’t know. It’s chaos here.”\nThanks to the rampaging awakened, everything was a mess.\n“Yeah, I see…”\nLena looked at Shihu with concern.\nWhat kind of comfort could possibly help someone who’s lost their last hope?\n“Shihu, if it ever gets too much, you can rely on me. It’s better than suffering alone.”\n“Thanks.”\nLena is a good friend.\nBut she isn’t Seo Ah.\nShihu walked with Lena, heading toward where their friends were.\nThe sun was rising.\nThe early morning air was cold.\nA ruin of steel, concrete, and asphalt stretched before them.\nShihu stopped walking.\nA twisted future.\nBut there was still hope.\n“What’s wrong?”\nSensing something strange, Lena turned back to look at him.\n“Here.”\nShihu held out a sword.\nIt was as if he was offering it to her.\n“Huh? Why? Are you giving it to me?”\n“It’s something I got from the academy.”\n“But why give it to me?”\n“I’m not going to use it anymore.”\nWhat was borrowed from the academy should be returned to it.\nI realized recently that the sword might even have a tracking device embedded in it.\nThe same could go for the uniform.\nBut even without those suspicions, I planned to discard them.\n“…Huh?”\n“I’m not going back to the academy anymore. Which means I probably won’t see you for a while.”\nHe was quitting.\nIt was a decision he should have made a long time ago.\n“W-What? Is this because of Seo Ah?”\n“Yeah. It was great meeting good friends like you, but honestly, I only stayed there for Seo Ah.”\n“So now… you’re not planning to see me anymore?”\n“For the time being, yeah.”\nHe was ready to discard the connections he made at the academy.\n“…I don’t know where you’re going, but let me come with you.”\n“You have family.”\nFor Shihu, family was just one person.\nBut Lena was different.\nShe had siblings and parents who were still alive and well.\n“But…”\nHe couldn’t take Lena with him.\n“Take care. See you later. It’s better if I just disappear from here.”\nShihu didn’t look like someone who had lost all hope.\nA fierce determination still burned in his eyes.\nHe still had a goal.\nStill.\nLena silently stared at Shihu.\nThe dawn was breaking.\nThe sun was rising.\nLight was streaming in.\n“…If you say so.”\nShihu hadn’t lost his light yet.\nAnd so, Lena decided to place her hope in him.\nShe didn’t know what he was planning to do.\nShe couldn’t fully grasp the situation.\nAll she could do was hope that whatever Shihu was striving for would work out.",

      "content": "It hurts.\nBut it’s fine.\nIt hurts.\nBut it’s fine.\nIt hurts.\nBut is it really fine?\nPretty sure several bones are broken. My body won’t move properly. Some muscles won’t respond at all.\nWhere’s the medicine?\nMedicine.\nI can’t see it. It’s too dark.\n“...Shihu?”\nI called out several times, but there’s no answer.\nIt’s so dark I can’t see anything.\nOr am I already dead?\nIf so, this pain feels far too real.\nThe dusty air.\nThe cold, hard floor beneath me.\nI can still feel.\nThe drugs have dulled the pain somewhat, but it still hurts.\nSo please, give me more drugs.\nNo. I can bear it.\nI’m fine for now.\nIt’s just my body acting up.\n“Shihu, Shihu, Shihu.”\nI keep calling into the void.\nNot long ago, we were talking.\nI’ve been trapped here for hours.\nUnless my sense of time is completely distorted, it might have been over ten hours.\n“It hurts a bit...”\nThe pain is tolerable, just enough for me to talk.\nIf it gets worse, I won’t be able to do anything but writhe.\nMaybe if I keep calling for Shihu, he’ll come.\n“Is anyone there?”\nDid I just wake up in a lab? Was all of this just a dream?\nThis feels a lot like being abandoned in a dark lab.\nAt least back then, I had drugs.\n[Deactivated]\nBroken, it seems.\nDeactivated, it says.\nI can’t even see a timer.\nDamn it.\n“Where’s the medicine...?”\nWasn’t I supposed to be turning into a dragon?\nI touch the top of my head, but the horns are gone.\nMaybe my eyes turned weird instead.\nI think I know what’s wrong.\nThere’s no mana.\nThis room is structured similarly to the labs.\nTo prevent test subjects from rampaging, they remove mana from the room.\nWithout mana, test subjects can’t do much.\nAfter all, something can’t come from nothing.\nSkills require mana.\nThat’s just how the laws of this world work.\n“Medicine...”\nMedicine makes me feel good.\nThat’s another rule.\nWithout it, I feel bad.\nThere’s no other way around it.\nWith superhuman willpower, I can set thoughts of drugs aside for a moment.\nBut willpower takes energy, and I don’t have any left.\nThe effects of the last dose seem to have worn off.\nShow me the timer.\nThere can’t be much time left.\n[Deactivated]\nAnd then more hours pass.\nI want to sleep, but I can’t.\nClank.\nSomewhere, I hear the sound of a door opening.\nClick.\nThe lights turn on.\nIt’s too bright to see anything.\n“Seo Ah.”\nIt’s Shihu’s voice.\nHe’s speaking from behind a wall.\n“Shihu?”\n“Yeah, it’s me. Sorry. This was the only way.”\n“Give me the medicine.”\nMy eyes are adjusting to the light.\nI still can’t see Shihu, but I see a metal door.\nThe place where I’m lying is a small room, just big enough to fit a bed.\nIt reminds me of a prison cell.\nWhy am I in a place like this?\nIt’s too much like the lab.\nAt least they gave me drugs there.\n“Give me the medicine.”\nI ask again.\n“...Just a moment.”\nI hear the sound of a lock turning.\nCreak.\nThe door opens.\nI can feel mana in the air.\n[Activated]\nIt’s easier to breathe now.\nI feel a bit of strength returning.\nAnd then my body moves on its own.\nFor the grand goal of world destruction, I can’t stay locked up in this tiny cell!\nKill Shihu and get out.\nHow should I kill him?\nWithout enough mana, I can’t do anything fancy.\nMedicine, give me a weapon.\nIn my hand, I feel the familiar texture of a dagger forming.\nThud.\nThe door closes.\nShihu steps into the room.\nHe’s close now.\n[Deactivated]\nI thrust the dagger toward Shihu.\n“Oh—”\nThe mana vanished.\nThe weapon disappeared from my hand, and my strength gave out.\nI almost collapsed, but Shihu caught me.\nIt’s because the door is closed.\nThe mana is completely gone.\n“...Ah...”\nShihu doesn’t look surprised.\nHe seems like he expected this.\n“Ah... I’m sorry, sorry, Shihu. I wasn’t trying to attack you. Sorry.”\n“It’s okay. I know.”\n“T-Thank you. I need medicine. Do you have any?”\nShihu shakes his head.\n“Seo Ah.”\n“Yeah?”\n“Doesn’t it hurt less now?”\n“Huh?”\nNow that he mentions it, my body doesn’t hurt anymore.\nI just feel weak.\nNot long ago, I was desperate for drugs.\n“Oh... It doesn’t hurt. What did you do?”\n“It happened last time too.”\n“...Last time?”\n“Yeah. Here.”\nFragments of memory resurface.\nI remember talking with Shihu not long ago.\nIn this exact place.\nBut why did I forget?\n“...Where are we?”\nI should’ve asked this earlier.\n“A solitary cell. It’s an old abandoned facility I repurposed.”\n“A solitary cell?”\n“It’s a room with mana suppression.”\n“Mana suppression?”\n“Yeah. When mana gets to you... like just now, you try to attack me or lose your senses.”\nThis sounds bad.\nFrom what he’s saying, it seems like if I’m not in this cell, I lose control.\nDoes the dragon take over?\nWhat the hell.\n“S-So... I guess I just have to stay here then?”\n“Yeah.”\n“But how did I end up here? I don’t remember.”\nMy head feels foggy.\nI don’t understand what’s going on.\nMy recent memories are hazy.\nWhen I tried to attack Shihu earlier, they became even fuzzier.\n“...You don’t remember?”\n“Not really. What was I doing before this? The lab?”\nI got out of the lab.\nBut what happened after that?\nOh, right, I almost became a dragon.\nAt the lab?\nNo, that’s not it.\nMy memories are all tangled up.\n“Did you save me, Shihu? Thank you. But I can’t leave yet, right?”\nShihu hesitated, seeming unsure how to answer.\n“At least it’s good I don’t need the medicine anymore.”\nIt seems like as long as I get mana at the right time, I’ll be fine.\nMaybe this is because I’ve become something dragon-like.\nI don’t think I need drugs anymore.\n“So, how will I heal? Do I have to stay here forever?”\nShihu remained silent.\nIt looked like he had something to say but couldn’t bring himself to speak.\n“Well...”\nShihu finally spoke.\n“There’s probably a safe way to get you out. There is a way, but...”\n“A way?”\nShihu hesitated again.\nI don’t understand why he’s so reluctant if there’s a way.\n“They sell a device on the black market. Something to control mana.”\n“A device? Would it work?”\nMagical tools are common enough.\nUsually, they’re just clothes enchanted with protective magic, but occasionally, you find items with unique properties.\n“You told me about it.”\n“I did? What did I say?”\n“But I’m not sure if it’s right for you...”\n“Huh?”\nWhat’s that supposed to mean?\nShihu looked conflicted.\n“...You don’t remember?”\n“If it’s not important, I probably forgot. What did I say? A mana control device?”\nI feel like I might’ve had a similar conversation with Shihu before.\n“No, it’s nothing.”\nThe way he said that only makes me more curious.\nWhat is it?\n“Just sit tight for a moment. I’ll go get it.”\nClick.\nThe doorknob turned, and the door opened.\n[Activated]\nThe door closed again.\n[Deactivated]\nSo the mana only cuts off when the door is closed.\nIt really is like the lab.\nWhat exactly is activating and deactivating?\nMana flow?\nAm I really about to awaken as a dragon?\nThis whole sealed black flame dragon thing used to be a joke.\nHow did it come to this?\nIf only I had all my memories intact, things would be clearer.\n“This is it.”\nShihu handed Seo Ah a collar.\nIt looked like a dog collar, but one enhanced with magic.\nSeo Ah tilted her head, unsure what to make of it.\n“I bought it on the black market. It seems functional, though I haven’t fully tested it yet.”\n“A collar?”\n“Yeah.”\n“Oh, I know what this is.”\n“You do?”\nShe had to know. If Seo Ah hadn’t told me about it in the first place, I wouldn’t have thought to buy one. But now, it seemed like she had no recollection of it.\nThe incident had happened the same day I teleported her to the solitary cell—a week ago.\n“Ah, Shihu, I’m sorry. I wasn’t trying to attack you. My body moved on its own.”\nShe had said something similar back then.\n“There’s better equipment for mana suppression… like a collar. They used it in the lab when moving subjects around.”\nAnd so, I’d managed to procure a collar.\n“While you’re at it, can you bring me some drugs?”\nThat was one request I couldn’t fulfill.\nThe more mana she came into contact with, the worse the situation got. The memory distortions became more pronounced. Drugs wouldn’t help her condition, and keeping her locked up forever wasn’t an option.\nSince this was an old government facility, staying here too long risked exposure. Avoiding attention was crucial for ensuring Seo Ah’s safety.\n“This is the one they used when transporting test subjects, right?”\n“Transporting?”\n“Yeah, when moving between facilities. They often kept subjects restrained in cars with this.” She paused, frowning slightly. “Oh, I think I mentioned it to you before. It’s coming back to me.”\nSeo Ah gave a faint, bashful smile.\nBut it wasn’t something to smile about.\nI couldn’t shake the uncomfortable feeling gnawing at me.\n“I’ll show you how to use it.”\nShe took the collar from my hands.\n“Okay, hold the leash.”\nI grabbed the leash, and she fastened the collar around her neck.\nClick.\nShe wouldn’t be able to take it off on her own, but with me around, it should be fine.\nSeo Ah didn’t seem to mind.\nShe was just happy about the prospect of getting out of the cell.\nI found myself staring at her blankly.\n“What’s wrong?”\nIt felt oddly familiar.\n“Ah, no. I mean... are you okay? Does it feel strange?”\n“What, the collar? I could probably pass it off as a fashion statement. I can go out now, right?”\nIt was far too reminiscent of walking a dog.\nThis wasn’t made for humans.\nIf you looked closely, you could see faint writing indicating that it was designed for transporting monsters.\n“...It’s weird if I’m holding the leash. Here, take it yourself.”\n“Weird?”\nSeo Ah seemed to ponder what was strange about it.\nMaybe she thought I was just complaining about the inconvenience of holding the leash.\n“Okay, I’m going to open the door now.”\n“Okay.”\nClick.\nThe door opened.\nThe air was fresh and tinged with mana.\n[Activated]\nThis isn’t good.\nSo much for mana suppression.\nIt looks like I bought defective goods from the black market.\nOne of Seo Ah’s eyes gleamed, taking on the predatory glint of a dragon’s mana-infused gaze.\nI could feel her killing intent as she prepared to attack me again.\nFirst, she summoned a weapon.\n[Deactivated]\nI grabbed the leash, and Seo Ah staggered as her strength drained away.\nShe became docile once more.\n“...Ah.”\nSo it only works when someone is holding the leash.\nI finally understood how the collar functioned.\n“Heh…”\nSeo Ah gave an awkward laugh.",

You won’t leave me behind now, right? Hmm?\"\n\"Of course, I won’t leave you. I was just thinking it might be uncomfortable if I keep holding onto the leash.\"\n\"If you let go, I’ll die.\"\nThe words are unsettling in a strange way.\nBut to some extent, it’s true.\nIf her magic isn't restrained, Seo Ah would be devoured by a dragon.\nThere’s no thought of letting go.\nBut maybe it would be more comfortable to hold the leash in a different way.\n\"...Ah, maybe it’d be okay if I just hook it on my wrist.\"\nShihu ties the leash around his left wrist.\nIt’s a good thing he can still use both hands.\nThe leash is two meters long.\nSeo Ah is standing right next to him.\nThere’s a strange chemical smell in the air.\n\"You won’t leave me, right?\"\nSeo Ah quietly asks.\n\"Where would I go?\"\n\"The Academy.\"\n\"Ah.\"\nHe wasn’t planning on going anyway.\nPerhaps Seo Ah is worried about that, and that’s why she wants the leash.\n\"If I leave you here by yourself, you’ll really die, won’t you?\"\n\"I’m not leaving.\"\n\"Hehe.\"\nThere’s no need to go to the Academy anymore.\nProbably never again.\n\"I’m not going to the Academy.\"\n\"Are you planning to go anywhere else?\"\n\"To somewhere safer.\"\n\"Safer?\"\n\"We should move to another city.\"\nShihu has already found a good place.\nFor Seo Ah.\n\"A trip?\"\n\"Yeah. But I’m not ready yet. There are still things I need to take care of.\"\n\"You can prepare slowly.\"\nSeo Ah tries to reassure him.\n\"I wish I could do that... but I can’t stay in this place for long.\"\nIt’s a problem because it’s a facility previously used by government agencies.\nIt was partially buried in the ground and then repaired.\nIt was fine when used occasionally as a prison, but staying here long-term is risky.\n\"So?\"\n\"I think I need to go alone for now.\"\n\"...Where to?\"\n\"To several places. There’s a lot to do before I can move.\"\n\"Let’s go together.\"\nAs much as he would like to, staying undetected is the priority.\nThe Academy might be looking for Shihu.\nThere would be problems if he drags Seo Ah around with the leash.\n\"I’ll go and come back as quickly as I can.\"\nIf he had known this would happen, he should have waited to put the leash on.\n\"You were thinking that again, weren’t you?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"The thought that you want to leave me. I can feel it.\"\n\"No, that’s wrong.\"\nHe’s never thought of such a thing.\nIt’s a dilemma.\nHe has to stay with Seo Ah, but he can’t stay with her constantly.\nIt’s a danger zone.\nThis facility is close to the city.\n\"You said you would protect me.\"\nSeo Ah says, her voice on the verge of tears.\nShe clutches Shihu’s sleeve.\nIt seems she’s losing control of her emotions.\n\"Let’s go together, together, together? Hmm?\"\nHer extreme anxiety is showing.\nIt’s not an unusual situation.\n\"I want to, but if we stay like this, we’ll both be in danger.\"\n\"We’ve always been in danger. You just want to make it dangerous for me, right? Don’t you?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"If you leave me, I’ll really die.\"\nIt’s a valid threat.\nShihu doesn’t want Seo Ah to die.\nIf it were the old Seo Ah, she wouldn’t have made such a threat.\nBecause she would be scared Shihu might actually tell her to die.\nBut now, whether she likes it or not, she knows the truth.\nShihu doesn’t want her to die.\n\"Don’t leave me.\"\n\"I’ll never leave you. But we can’t stay like this. I’m trying to find a better solution.\"\n\"Don’t leave me...\"\n\"It’s okay. I won’t go. When you’re okay, just let me know.\"\nThey’re in the hallway of the facility where the solitary room is located.\nHe sits Seo Ah down on a chair in the hallway and sits beside her.\nHe has time to calm her down.\nBut he can’t stay with her forever.\nWhat’s the best solution?\nLocking her in the modified solitary room?\nHe doesn’t want to treat her like a monster.\nEven if he locks her up, Seo Ah might not remember.\nWould that be okay? He’s not sure.\nSometimes, decisive actions are necessary.\nIf he hopes for a future, he must endure the pain of the present.\n\"...Let’s just stay here.\"\nWould that be the best choice?\nThe thought crosses Shihu’s mind.\n\"Let’s just stay here.\"\nIt would be nice to be with Seo Ah.\nIt’s always been that way.\nSeo Ah rests her head on his shoulder.\nAt this point, he can’t get up.\n\"He.\"\nSeo Ah laughs.\nA slight happiness is felt.\nAh.\nMaybe it’s best to stay like this.\nThis is the conclusion Shihu comes to.\nWhat should they do next?\nThe plan is like this.\nFirst, destroy everything that guarantees their identity.\nFrom the Academy student ID to the school uniform.\nAnd even the citizenship card they received at that time.\nEverything, including their phone, will be destroyed.\nMoney is kept in a way that avoids being monitored.\nThen, they’ll change their identity.\nThe goal is to escape to a safe place and live quietly.\nEscape.\nIs running away without fighting the right thing to do?\nAs long as there’s something to protect, one cannot blame someone for running away.\n—Shihu, without you, there will be a gap in our forces. If you were here, there would be people we could save, but also people we couldn’t.\nThis is something Cheon Yuhwa said after Shihu’s announcement.\nBut after thinking it over, he realizes that trying to save the world when he can’t even protect one friend is arrogant.\nAnd is saving people really a good thing?\nIs it the right thing to do?\nEven if it’s not wrong, it’s not something worth obsessing over.\nIn the end, the people who are going to die will die.\nAnd if the people he saved turn out to be like doctors, then that’s troublesome too.\nIt’s better to let things flow as they will.\n\"...I don’t care anymore.\"\nShihu mutters.\nSeo Ah is already asleep.\nShe’s resting her head on his shoulder.\n***\nWhen I opened my eyes, I was alone.\nHad they locked me in the room again while I was asleep?\nI don’t understand.\n\"...Please...? Please. Why...?\"\nBut that can’t be true.\nThey couldn’t have just left me.\nI’ll die if they do.\n\"Why did you leave me?\"\nWe were supposed to stay together.\nThat was the plan.\nThe objects around me look distorted.\nThey’re still, yet they move erratically.\nIt’s clear—I’ve lost it.\nEven just hearing these awkward words, I can tell.\nNo, I don’t even know what I said.\n—Shihu, I’m okay.\nHad I said that?\n—I’ll stay in the room for now. So hurry back.\nWhy didn’t I just say we should stay together?\nI feel calm being with Shihu.\nIt was the wrong choice, though.\n\"...Hehe, he.\"\nWhen will I go back to being normal?\nI need some medicine.\n\"Ah. Shihu?\"\nYou're there, right?\nYes.\n\"...No, I’m not.\"\nI’m losing it.\nI hate myself.\n[Inactive]\nBut Shihu said he could leave, so…\nI don’t even know what’s different from the monster transport.\nBut this is Shihu’s mercy.\nTaking care of a childhood friend who’s somewhat like a monster.\nRemember the novel’s content.\nTry to remember what happens after this.\nBut now, there’s no answer.\nShihu in the novel wouldn’t have done this.\nAt this point, Shihu was already a perfect individual.\nHe was complete.\nHe understood the hidden schemes his allies didn’t know about and destroyed them.\nThe heroines all liked Shihu.\nEveryone respected him.\n\"Because of me, Shihu...\"\nIt’s not just Shihu who’s in trouble.\nIf things had gone as they were supposed to, those who would’ve been close to Shihu are now distant because of me.\nBecause of me.\nIt’s all my fault.\nI should never have started reading this stupid novel from the beginning.\nWasn’t it too harsh on the protagonist’s childhood friend?\nI think I had that question back then too.\n\"I must have done something wrong.\"\nThat’s why I’m suffering.\nBut it’s not just suffering.\nThere was a certain pleasure, an immense pleasure, that only a few in a lifetime might experience.\nI never wanted it.\nI just feel sorry for Shihu.\n\"I need to help Shihu.\"\nBut how can I help him?\nLook at what’s left for me.\nThere’s nothing.\n\"How should I help?\"\nI need something to give him.\nSomething he would like.\nWhat could that be?\nLet me think.\nWhat does Shihu want from me?\n\"I only have my body.\"\nI have nothing.\nIt’s all borrowed.\n\"...\"\nThere must be something.\nSomething I can give Shihu.\nI’ll apologize for ruining his life.\n\"My body?\"\nIt’s a mess.\nCovered in scribbles, making it worse.\nI remember Shihu getting angry.\nAsking if I’m selling my body.\nSo, what Shihu really wants is...\n\"...Really? Does he want my body? Could that be it?\"\nI’m jumping to conclusions here.\nBut if Shihu comes back, I’ll ask him.\nI’ll ask him clearly what he really wants.\nShihu isn’t the type to enjoy indulgence.\nHe had plenty of heroines.\nBut there’s no real indulgence I can offer him.\n\"I don’t want that...\"\nHow could I?\nI can’t just use my body recklessly.\nBut rather than going back to the testing facility...\n\"I don’t want to...\"\nThe pain I feel now, after the medicine has worn off, is worse.\nIf the pain gets too much, eventually, you have no choice but to give in.\nWhat should I say when Shihu comes?\nMy head is spinning.\nI feel like I’m in a nightmare.\nI think I hear researchers.\nIs all of this a dream?\nOr am I really on a testing table?\nI’m shaking.\nI need the medicine.\nMedicine.\nSomething’s coming closer.\nThere’s something in the dark.\nI know it’s a hallucination, but it’s not.\nI hear the voice of a researcher right next to me.\nIf Shihu were here, I’d at least feel a little safer.\nBut no one’s here.\nWhy did I let Shihu go outside?\nI hear a disgusting voice.\nA hateful laugh.\nI see people laughing at me.\n\"Ah, ahaha...\"\nI try to laugh.\nIt’s a habit.\nI did it because they say happiness comes when you smile.\nCalm down.\nThere’s nothing.\nNo one can hurt me.\nBut then, I hear it again.\nThe sound of a surgical knife falling on a metal tray.\nAh.\nI keep hearing murmuring voices.\nEven when I block my ears, I still hear them.\nPlease.\nPlease save me.\nPlease.\nPlease.\nPlease.\nPlease, I need the medicine.\nI’ll do anything.",

I’ll do anything for the medicine.\nMy body and mind were already long ago conquered.\nWhen the effects of the drugs wear off, I try to act normal, but just a little while later, I end up like this.\nIt hurts so much I want to die.\nBut if I die on my own, Shihu will be sad.\nAnd that’s something I can’t bear.\nI just want to be happy.\nI just want...\nA normal...\nLife...\n\"Where’s the doctor?\"\nIt’s because of that person.\nThe reason Shihu left me in this place.\nWho do you think caused me to start using drugs in the first place?\nA doctor.\nIf there hadn’t been any drugs, Seo Ah would have lived happily with Shihu.\nWhether she went to the Academy or not, she would have been fine!\nWith this mind of mine, I could never have been a hero.\nSeo Ah was just an ordinary person.\nJust a regular citizen who longed to be a hero.\n\"The doctor... where...?\"\nIt’s a relief.\nIt’s a relief that there are other people to blame besides just me.\nThank goodness!\nLet’s blame everything on you, doctor!\nBad adult!\nThe only adult Seo Ah could depend on was the doctor at the relief station.\nBut one day, the station disappeared.\nOne day, a strange doctor appeared.\n\"The real doctor... where...\"\nWhere could he have gone?\nI wouldn’t know.\nHe’s not even a character in the novel.\nJust someone I found in Seo Ah’s memory.\n\"Please, stop.

I should have come sooner.\"\nShihu apologizes.\n\"Ah, you’re here?\"\nThese days, I often confuse hallucinations or dreams with reality, so I have to be careful.\nShould I really be careful about this?\nMy head is a little less noisy now.\n\"Yeah, I’ve prepared everything. We can leave right now.\"\n\"Where to?\"\n\"Another city... maybe a rural area. Anyway, a safe place. Let’s go together.\"\nWas that the plan?\nI wonder.\nIt’s very different from the novel.\n\"Are you helping me?\"\n\"Huh? Yeah. Of course.\"\nLet me confirm.\nI just need to figure out why Shihu is helping me.\nI’ve come up with several theories, but the most plausible ones are these.\nHypothesis 1: Shihu’s pure goodwill toward a friend.\nHypothesis 2: Shihu wants something else.\nHypothesis 2-1: Shihu will help me even after getting what he wants.\nHypothesis 2-2: Shihu will abandon me after getting what he wants.\n\"You don’t need to try so hard.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"If you want something, just say it. I’ll do whatever I can.\"\n\"I just want you to come with me.\"\nShihu says, slightly flustered.\nWhat he wants.\nWhat he desires.\nWhat I can give.\n\"Anyway, you’ve seen all the scars, but if you want this body, I’ll give it to you. But seriously, it’s really loud.\"\nHe’s talking about the music.\n\"...Huh?\"\n\"You can do whatever you want with me. Anything. Isn’t that what you want?\"\nShihu’s expression stiffens.\n***\nWhat is Seo Ah saying?\nShihu feels as if he has been struck, and he continues listening to Seo Ah’s words.\n\"I know what you’re worried about…\"\nShe says this calmly, then smiles as if she knows everything.\n\"What if Seo Ah is just trash? What if she’s been using her body carelessly, going around abusing herself? Is that what you're worried about?\"\nWas she thinking that?\nShihu thinks he understands how Seo Ah perceives him.\nA part of his heart aches.\n\"Why don’t you check for yourself? I don’t know, so...\"\nShe says this while starting to undo the buttons on her shirt.\nClick.\nShihu grabs Seo Ah’s wrist.\nHe’s scared he knows what she’s about to do.\n\"Don’t.\"\nThe hand holding Seo Ah’s wrist is trembling.\n\"Stop it, Seo Ah. Don’t do this.\"\n\"Why? You told me to say if I wanted something. Shihu, I... have nothing left but my body.\"\nEach word Seo Ah speaks makes Shihu’s heart sink.\nA painful tightness presses on his chest.\n\"I’m scared, I feel like I’m losing my friend more and more. No, Seo Ah. You...”\nSeo Ah’s expression hardens in an instant.\nHer eyes tremble, and he sees the remains of her broken self-esteem.\nWas it a slip of the tongue?\n\"Yeah. Shihu.\"\nShe forces a smile and continues.\n\"I’m not Seo Ah anymore. I’m just some semblance of her. The friend you knew is already dead. Let’s hold a funeral for her. Seo Ah disappeared a long time ago.\"\nShe hasn’t disappeared.\nNever.\nShihu grips her wrist tighter.\n\"No, you haven’t disappeared. You’re still here. I’m looking at you. It’s you here.\"\nShe hasn’t disappeared.\nDesperation and faint anger mix in his voice.\n\"Whatever you think, whatever happened... I still don’t want to let you go. So...\"\n\"Shut up.\"\nSeo Ah says this because of the music, but there is no music in Shihu’s ears.\nHe’s grown used to being rejected.\nShihu is only expressing his own will.\n\"I’m sorry.\"\nShihu releases the hand holding Seo Ah’s wrist.\nThen, with both hands, he gently takes hers.\n\"But you can’t throw yourself away like this… Don’t cast yourself aside. It will get better. So please...\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nPlease.\nShihu hopes with all his heart that Seo Ah will be okay.\nHe wants to see her smile again, the smile from before.\nHe wishes for the day when she can laugh freely.\nSeo Ah, with Shihu’s hands holding hers, finds a moment of calm.\nAt least, it seems that way.\n\"Then, you know...\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"I was trying to say something... but it’s so noisy I forgot.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"It’s noisy, isn’t it? It’s chaotic.\"\nBy now, Shihu has come to understand the meaning behind Seo Ah’s words about the noise.\nShe’s thinking something is noisy.\nSomething other than his words.\n\"Ah, I remembered.\"\nSeo Ah holds Shihu’s hand with both of hers.\n\"Why did you do that? Why did you say those things? Why did you try to strangle me to death? Do you still hate me? Is it because I tried to kill you? I’m sorry. But you probably still hate me, right? You still think I’m suspicious. You know, Shihu, broken trust can never be repaired. It’s noisy.\"\nShe pours out her words.\n\"I’m sorry. That was the side effect of the purification skill. If you really believe I was going to do that... rest assured, I never wanted to. Please, don’t worry.\"\n\"Ah? Side effects. Hmm. I see. Hmm. I think I said something like that. Sorry, my memory hasn’t been great lately...\"\nSeo Ah speaks quietly.\nYou can see how her emotions change rapidly.\n\"It’s okay.\"\n\"I don’t know anything.\"\n\"If you don’t know, then just come with me. That’s enough for now.\"\n\"Ah, noisy... I’m not crying, no. I’m not... I mean, this isn’t it.\"\nSeo Ah mutters, sounding confused.\nShihu wonders if he’s playing music in her head again, but he can’t tell.\n\"...This isn’t it... I’m going, but... Shihu, you understand what I’m saying, right? It’s like... this... ah... ah... ah...\"\n\"Take your time.\"\n\"Ah, um... sorry.\"\nSeo Ah speaks in a voice that sounds like she’s about to cry.\n\"It’s okay. It’s not too late. You’re not alone.\"\nHe whispers softly.\nMaybe these are the words Shihu himself wanted to hear.\nIt’s not too late.\nIt’s not too late.\nNot yet.\nNot yet.\n\"Hehe... He...\"\nSeo Ah is still laughing.\nIt must not be too late.",

I’d lick your feet if you wanted me to.\"\n\"Did you do that to the doctor?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nBut the doctor told me not to, because it’s dirty.\nShihu gives a small chuckle.\nI don’t know what’s funny.\n\"Okay...\"\n\"Give me the drugs.\"\nShihu remains silent again.\n\"If you don’t give me the drugs, I’ll die.\"\nThis line is repeated so many times.\nI’m saying this because I’m really going to die.\nI hate this world.\nActually, I hope Shihu will just kill me already.\n\"Yeah, just kill me. Neither of us wants to keep living like this, right? Shihu.\"\n\"......\"\nBut Shihu doesn’t kill me.\nHe doesn’t give me the drugs either.\n\"Or do something to me. I’m allowing it.\"\nI’m speaking seriously.\nI don’t care what Shihu does.\nI really don’t want to live like this anymore.\n\"You’ve got a plan, don’t you? I know. It’s a coercive plan, right? I know. You’re wondering what will happen if you become like the doctor, aren’t you? I know.\"\n\"...You...\"\n\"Anything is fine. Honestly, even if you don’t plan to save me, it’s okay. Just play with me and throw me away.\"\n\"You deserve it.\"\nShihu grits his teeth and looks at me.\nIt looks like he’s trying to make a painful decision.\nThen he barely opens his mouth and speaks.\n\"...There’s a way...\"\nThere must be.\nA protagonist is a protagonist.\nNo matter how bleak, they must be doing something.\n\"If there is, there is... but honestly, I don’t want to do this.\"\nWhat’s that?\nBut even in this situation, I’m impressed that he’s found a way.\n\"Anything is fine.\"\nThen Shihu pulls out a syringe filled with the drug.\nSo it’s the drug again.\nThe universal drug.\nIn the end, the conclusion always comes down to the drug.\nA shimmering rainbow-colored drug I’ve never seen before.\nIt’s amazing, even though no light is shining on it.\n\"This is a drug that erases memories.\"\n\"Memory?\"\nI already have amnesia.\nI’ve forgotten so much, it’s scary.\n\"Yeah. It’s more like changing memories. It changes bad memories into happy ones.\"\n\"Oh...\"\nSuch a thing exists?\n\"It’s a drug I got by chance... It’s called ‘Reset’ or ‘Initialize.’ It’s that strong...\"\nShihu hesitates.\nFrom what he says, it’s not something to be used lightly.\nDid they grind up a monster to make this?\nIt probably came from grinding up some magical beast.\n\"Yeah, yeah, hurry up and use it. Isn’t that why you brought me here?\"\nNow I understand his intent.\nWe’ve moved to a new place, but it doesn’t feel all that new.\nIt’s too familiar.\nMy room.\nIt’s the same as our old house in the slums, before it turned to ruins.\nThe same interior structure before it became all ruins.\nOld, but cozy.\n\"I know you’ve thought about it a lot. Do what you want. I don’t want to keep living like this either. Thank you.\"\nI know.\nThere’s more to this than just a memory-erasing drug.\nShihu has some plan in mind.\nBut he’s just been delaying it out of concern for me.\n\"Hurry up. If you’re going to do it, do it quickly. I can’t keep living like this.\"\nI urge him.\nHis expression still shows hesitation.\n\"Yeah? Quickly. Yeah, just put it there. Like that.\"\nShihu injects the syringe.\nThud.\nIt hurts.\nSomething flows through my nerves.\nAnd the resetting begins.\n\"Thank you.\"\nThe injection is over.\nShihu blankly looks down at his hand.\nHe stares at the empty syringe in his hand.\n\"...Ah.\"\nHis expression looks shocked.\nHe seems to realize what he’s just done.\n\"Hehe.\"\nBut it can’t be undone.\nI feel sleepy.\n\"Shihu, I love you...\"\nMy speech is slurring.\nBut my feelings are sincere.\n***\nShihu’s hands were trembling.\nHe realized what he had done.\nAlong with the words \"I love you,\" Seo Ah collapsed.\nHe had reset Seo Ah’s memory.\nMore specifically, he had sent it back to a much earlier time.\nHow far back it went, he didn’t know, but it was certainly a long way back.\nIn exchange for this, the current Seo Ah would disappear.\nHe had killed her.\nBecause she no longer pleased him.\n\"Ha, ha...\"\nIt had been almost a month since they moved to a safe place.\nSeo Ah had been mumbling constantly, over and over, beside him.\nIn truth, the drugs had already been provided.\nSeo Ah just didn’t remember that fact.\nThis was the only method left.\n\"I...

      "content": "The memory-erasing drug alone won’t solve this problem.\nIt’s not even a simple drug to begin with.\nSo, additional steps are necessary.\nSeo Ah can’t be denied the drug.\nWith the regression of her memories, her body will recover to some extent, but the dragon, the drug addiction, and the scars on her body—there are still many problems to resolve.\nSo, Shihu found a solution.\nFirst, he would start with Seo Ah’s memory.\nIt might be an act of desecration toward Seo Ah.\nChanging her entire memory to make it convenient for Shihu.\n\"I’m sorry...\"\nCorrecting the memory is simple.\nWhat matters is when she wakes up.\nWhen Seo Ah just wakes up.\nThe time when she wonders what happened is the most crucial.\nThat moment must be explained properly.\nIt has to be something Seo Ah can understand.\nSo, Shihu waited.\nHe waited until Seo Ah woke up.\nWhile he pondered over what he had done.\nWas this really the right thing to do?\nSeo Ah had told him to do whatever was necessary.\nShe had said she was fine with whatever happened.\nBut was this really the only way?\nReally?\nIt doesn’t matter that Seo Ah is in front of him now.\nHow far can such logic take him?\n\"Ah...\"\nHe had prepared a script.\nHe had already thought about how to explain the situation when Seo Ah woke up.\nSince he wasn’t sure how much her memory would regress, he had prepared several scenarios.\nIt felt so deceitful.\nBut there didn’t seem to be a better way.\nUnless they slowly destroyed everything together.\nSeo Ah knew.\nShe knew and entrusted it to Shihu.\nShe said she didn’t mind what happened to her.\nShe told him to do something to solve the situation.\nSo, this choice had to be the right one.\nNo matter what the process was, as long as the result was good.\nIf he could still give Seo Ah happiness, even now.\n\"The drugs... the envelope is intact.\"\nIt looked like a prescription from a hospital.\nBut what was inside wasn’t the kind of medication the hospital would give.\nFor now, Shihu planned to play the role of a doctor.\nHe would give drugs to his childhood friend to treat her illness.\nEven if it was a drug.\nHanding drugs to a childhood friend with his own hands felt like the worst thing.\nThe worst.\nShihu felt it deeply in his bones.\nIt was inevitable.\nThere was no other option.\nAnd then another problem.\nThe dragon.\nThe only noticeable physical change was the growth of horns.\nBut if there was no magic, the horns would disappear.\nEven if her memory was restored, dealing with the dragon was a separate issue.\nWhen Seo Ah transforms into a dragon, she loses quite a bit of her rationality.\nBut the dragon’s natural healing ability helps.\nHer body recovers when exposed to magic.\nThe side effects of the drugs are largely counteracted.\nThe addictive nature of the drug, though, can’t be helped.\n\"The dragon... I can suppress it.\"\nHe hadn’t found a way to eliminate it yet.\nBut suppression was possible.\nHe had also obtained a magic blocking device, not just the leash.\nIt was a more complicated device to use than the leash since it was charged with magic, but it was a less intrusive necklace.\nIt didn’t look strange even when worn outside.\n\"The scars...\"\nDamn it.\nThe disgusting humans.\nEvery time he thought about it, curses came out.\nEven if he restored her memory, he’d still have to deal with the scars.\nThat’s why he had no choice but to rely on the drug.\nIf the drug works properly, it could be done.\nThe performance is perfect. And we had some leftover stock. Where did he get such a good drug?\nShihu had saved many people.\nHe saved, saved, and saved, and...\nEventually, people started coming to repay him.\nAnd one day, he saved the head of a black market syndicate.\nFrom there, a dark network started to form.\nThey weren’t exactly morally upright people.\nWhen you save people, you end up saving both the good and the bad.\nIt wasn’t easy to get drugs from the black market.\nThere were plenty of drugs available, but the ones Seo Ah needed were hard to find.\nBut there was a way.\nThere had been a time when Shihu rescued a young girl.\nAnd her parents came looking for him.\nThey were the owners of a munitions factory.\nThey were also notorious for military procurement corruption.\nThey loved their daughter so much that, as a thank you for saving her, they allowed Shihu to take a substantial amount of special drugs made in their factory.\nThe drug issue was temporarily solved that way.\nWith connections and resources, anything was possible.\nSometimes he wondered how such a drug came to be.\nIf someone were to ask about the original use of the memory-erasing drug, it was obvious.\nIt was generally used for illegal purposes.\nSo why had he used it on Seo Ah?\n***\nI open my eyes.\nI close them again.\nIn the morning, I’m a bit weak.\nBut I have to get up.\nI open my eyes again.\nI close them again.\nI think about five minutes have passed.\nI open my eyes once more and sit up.\nAnother usual day begins.\nA little light is coming in from the ceiling.\nIt’s not rain, but light, so I’m glad.\nThe weather is clear, which is nice.\n\"Mm...\"\nIt feels like I had a long dream.\nIt’s an ordinary day, but it feels strangely like it’s been a long time.\nAs I wake up, I find Shihu, who had already gotten up.\nHe’s in the kitchen, making food for me.\n\"Shihu?\"\n\"Oh, you’re awake.\"\n\"Mm...? Hm? Huh?\"\nSomething’s different.\nShihu is different.\n\"What’s this? Why did you grow so much?\"\nHe’s taller.\nIt feels like he’s grown a lot.\n\"It’s been some time.\"\nShihu answers.\nWell, I guess that makes sense.\nWhen did time pass like that?\nAh, my head hurts.\nI don’t want to think about it.\nWhat’s the problem?\n\"I see. What are you making?\"\nIt feels like my eye level has risen a bit.\nDid I grow too?\nMaybe it’s because time passed.\nWhen did that time pass?\n\"Sandwiches.\"\nShihu is making simple sandwiches.\nThey look delicious.\nThey seem better than what I would buy at a convenience store.\n\"...Aren’t they expensive?\"\nI’m worried about whether the ingredients are expensive.\nWhere did he get them?\n\"You don’t need to worry about money.\"\n\"Really?\"\nIt seems like he’s been earning money somewhere.\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Well, I’ll eat well, then.\"\nWe sit at the table to eat together.\nUsually, the things we eat for breakfast are lacking.\nIt’s enough if there’s enough for both of us to share.\nBut today is different.\nIt’s a nice breakfast.\nGenerous and good.\n\"What are you going to do today?\"\nI ask Shihu.\nI can’t remember well what we did yesterday.\nDid we go on a trip somewhere?\n\"What do you want to do?\"\n\"I don’t know.\"\nI asked first because I don’t know.\nSomething feels different today.\nIf I asked to go out and play, he feels too unfamiliar.\nIt feels like he’s grown too much.\nIt would be strange to play house when he’s all grown up.\nI wouldn’t have thought like this yesterday.\nWhat a strange day.\n\"Oh, what’s that necklace?\"\nIt’s a simple string necklace that I’ve never seen before.\n\"A gift. You need to keep wearing it.\"\n\"Okay!\"\nI’ll keep wearing it.\nA gift... I like it.\n\"Oh, uh? Shihu.\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"Hey, there’s a scar on your arm.\"\nI noticed it while eating.\n\"Don’t worry about it. It’s nothing weird.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nIf Shihu says it’s not weird, then it’s not.\nWho would think a scar is weird?\nNo one.\nIt’s completely natural.\n\"How about a walk?\"\n\"Let’s do it.\"\nWe go outside.\nOutside.\nI put on warm clothes.\nOut of the house.\nWas the house always like this?\nSomething’s different.\n\"...Is this our house?\"\nSomething’s different.\nThe atmosphere seems the same as usual, though.\n\"Yeah.\"\nHe says it’s our house.\nSo, I guess it is.\n\"Everything around here is different. This is our house, but it’s strange.\"\nI thought I knew the area well.\nBut something’s different.\nIt feels oddly like home, but also not.\nIt’s strange.\n\"This is our neighborhood now.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nIf Shihu says so, then I guess it is.\nIt doesn’t really matter.\nI hum a song with no lyrics as we walk out the door.\n\"Oh, wait.\"\nShihu speaks, as if he just remembered something.\nWe go back into the house.\n\"Why?\"\n\"Take your medicine... you need to.\"\n\"Medicine?\"\nWhat kind of medicine is he talking about?\nI’m not sick.\nNot at all.\nIs it medicine for me?\n\"It’s for a cold. You need to prevent it.\"\nHe hands me the medicine.\n\"I’m not sick. Is this from the relief center?\"\n\"Relief center... yeah.\"\nShihu’s mood is more subdued than usual.\nSomething’s different.\n\"Why? Are you worried about something?\"\nI ask with a smile.\nShihu’s acting strangely today.\n\"Sorry. There’s nothing to worry about.\"\n\"Why are you sorry?\"\nThere’s no reason to be sorry.\n\"Everything’s weird today. Something’s off.\"\n\"Nothing is weird.\"\nOkay.\nIf that’s what he says, then it must be true.\nEverything’s normal.\n\"Yeah. Nothing’s weird.\"\nHe smiles brightly.\nShihu looks at me with a slightly surprised expression.\nIt seems like he feels a lot of guilt.\nBut nothing is weird.\n\"Oh, right. I remember what we did yesterday. We played treasure hunt. Where did you put the stuff we found yesterday?\"\nThe treasure was just a glass shard from the playground sandbox.\nOr a torn piece of cloth, maybe a can lid.\nIt’s fun collecting things like that.\nIf you think of them as treasures, they are treasures.\nIf you call them gems, they become gems.\n\"Treasure hunt... Ah, that...?\"\n\"I think I put them in the drawer.\"\n\"Ah, wait, don’t open it.\"\n\"Okay. Got it.\"\nShihu must have kept the treasures well, so there’s no need to check them.\n\"Then let’s do treasure hunting again today.\"\nIt’s just continuing the game we played yesterday.\nBut it’s so strange.\n\"But yesterday was summer.\"\nToday is winter.\nThe seasons change so quickly, huh?\nI didn’t know.\n\"...Well, whatever. Let’s go out and play.\"\nIt’s a normal day.\nExcept for the fact that Shihu doesn’t seem very happy.\nIt’s as normal as can be.\n\"I need to take medicine.\"\n\"I’m not sick. The relief center even told me not to take any random medicine.\"\n\"It’s for prevention. Here.\"\nA pill.\nA cup of water.\n\"That, that.\"\nI can’t take it.\nI can’t take that pill.\nThe medicine...\nI can’t take pills.\n\"I... I can’t swallow pills... you know.\"\nIt’s difficult.\nThat’s why I only take powdered medicine.\n\"Ah.\"\nShihu stands there for a moment, dazed.\nDid he forget?\nI feel disappointed.\nBut it’s okay.\nI got a necklace as a gift today.\nThere’s nothing to be upset about.\n\"Anyway, let’s go to the relief center later and get some more. It’s not urgent. Right?\"\nNothing’s urgent.\nIt’s just a peaceful day.",

      "content": "Extreme deception.\nI brought back the Seo Ah from the past and manipulated her at will.\nWhat would have happened if someone other than Shihu had done this?\nShe couldn’t take the pill.\nThat’s how it used to be.\nIt was strange to inject her with the syringe, something Seo Ah used to fear.\nBack then, she was terrified even of the syringe needle.\nShe had said we should take the medicine later and went for a walk.\nIt’s a deception.\nThe walking path feels strange even to Shihu.\nIt seems like a place falling apart, but the area is completely different from the old house.\nAnd if we were to be specific, this place is closer to the countryside.\n\"Everything feels unfamiliar. Something is off.\"\nSeo Ah’s impression.\nWe finished our walk.\nActually, it’s not just Seo Ah who feels strange, it’s Shihu too.\n\"There’s a bandage... What’s this?\"\nAfter a short walk, we returned home.\nI had placed the bandages around Seo Ah’s scars to prevent her from noticing them right away.\nAnd again, the deception continues.\n\"It’s nothing.\"\nSeo Ah accepts this, just as she always does.\nBecause of the medicine.\nJust like how a duck thinks the first thing it sees is its mother after hatching.\nSeo Ah is similar.\nShe believes and accepts everything Shihu says.\n\"Can I take it off?\"\n\"No, not yet. I’ve called someone to treat it... keep it on until then.\"\n\"Okay, but why am I hurt?\"\nShe’s in pain.\nIt’s hard to say exactly where or how it hurts.\n\"It will be fine soon.\"\n\"I don’t remember being hurt.\"\nThe memory was erased by Shihu.\nTo make things convenient.\n\"Looks like you’re troubled about something. Right?\"\nIt would be a lie to say there’s nothing.\nShihu stays silent.\n\"Tell me. I’ll fix it for you.\"\nIt’s been a long time since I’ve heard these words.\nHonestly, if we’re talking about age, Shihu is probably the older one.\nI don’t know his exact age, but it would be strange for Seo Ah to call herself the older sister.\n\"Why? Huh? Just tell me. I always tell you when I have worries.\"\nWe need to talk to each other.\nSeo Ah knew this very well.\nFor a friend to remain a friend.\nFor a family to stay like a family, they need to talk.\nNot just one-sided deception.\nPerhaps that’s where the problem started from the very beginning.\nEverything went wrong the moment Shihu hid the truth from Seo Ah.\nWith the thought that she could handle it alone.\nWith the idea that she couldn’t be put in danger.\nIt was out of goodwill.\nBut twisted goodwill is nothing but malice.\n\"Shihu, why? Huh? Why? Is it because of me? Did I do something wrong? You said there was nothing strange just a moment ago.\"\nSeo Ah urges him to speak quickly.\nBut the truth can’t be told.\nNow, I can’t even tell what the truth is.\nThere’s no benefit in knowing the truth.\nKnowing it won’t solve anything.\n\"I’ll tell you later.\"\nThat’s the best I could come up with.\nAfter everything’s done, I’ll tell you.\n\"When it’s all over, we’ll talk about it.\"\n\"...Looks like you’re going through something difficult.\"\nSeo Ah nods as if she understands this much.\n\"Yeah...\"\nShihu answers indifferently.\nIt’s tough.\nIt feels like my judgment is about halfway collapsed.\nI just want to be with Seo Ah.\nThe ones who ruined Seo Ah were others.\nFor reasons I can’t understand.\nBut now, it’s Shihu’s turn.\nTo ruin things himself.\n\"Don’t worry. Over time, everything will be solved. I’m here with you.\"\nHe encourages me.\nWith a smile.\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"I like that about you. How you try hard. How you never give up.\"\nIt’s the first time I’ve heard such praise from Seo Ah in a long while.\nI should feel happy, but I don’t.\nSomething feels cold in my chest.\n\"Thanks to you, I always rely on you.\"\nIt’s not unusual for Seo Ah to say things like this.\nShe would often thank Shihu when they were young.\nBut it’s been a long time since she last said it.\n\"So, if you have something on your mind, tell me. It’s better for us to rely on each other.\"\nIn an equal relationship, that’s possible.\nBut now, Shihu holds all the power.\nSeo Ah just doesn’t realize it.\nShihu can’t bring himself to say anything.\nIf he says there’s no problem, Seo Ah will believe him.\nFrom Seo Ah’s perspective, this is a series of absurd events.\nBut she accepts everything just by hearing Shihu’s words.\nThinking about it is scary.\nShihu has controlled Seo Ah to the point of altering her sense of reason.\nEvery word has to be chosen carefully.\nThere’s nothing that can be revealed to Seo Ah here.\n\"...It’s okay.\"\n\"Yeah. If you say so, then it must be.\"\nSeo Ah stops asking, looking relieved.\nIt’s clear that Shihu is twisting Seo Ah’s way of thinking.\nBut it’s necessary.\nTo keep Seo Ah from being shocked.\nSuddenly, a thought crosses my mind.\nIsn’t this just brainwashing?\nManipulating my childhood friend for my benefit.\nErasing all the bad memories, and making Seo Ah a happy version of herself.\nIf Seo Ah is happy, Shihu will be happy too, that’s the calculation.\nWhat if one day Seo Ah finds out?\nIt’s already precarious enough.\nThat’s why I have to finish it quickly.\nI need to treat Seo Ah.\n\"...Someone will be here soon to treat you.\"\nFor now, I have to use the Saintess.\n***\nGenerally, the Saintess can heal anything.\nShihu forcibly dragged her here, and while she’s not happy about it, the Saintess still agreed to help Seo Ah.\n\"It's not at the level of drug addiction...\"\nThis was the conclusion after examining Seo Ah.\nSeo Ah is peacefully sleeping.\n\"You can get rid of the scars, right?\"\n\"Wow...\"\nShe checked with her skill.\nThe more she examined Seo Ah, the darker the Saintess's expression became.\nThe Saintess is responsible too.\nIt was the Saintess who handed Seo Ah over to the laboratory.\n\"Why?\"\n\"The drug you gave her... it was for resetting her memories.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"I don’t usually say this, but… is this really something you should do to a close friend?\"\nThe Saintess also has doubts.\nEthically, this doesn’t seem right.\n\"Shouldn’t you be the one to say that? You tried to alter memories too.\"\nThe Saintess tried to destroy memories before.\n\"I’m sorry, but what you did isn’t all that different...\"\nThe person who tried to alter memories, the person who successfully carried it out, was Shihu.\nEven more seriously than the Saintess.\n\"Just heal her already.\"\n\"Mm.\"\nThe Saintess erases the scars.\n\"[Partial treatment]\"\nShe erases and erases.\n\"I was wondering why erasing scars was so urgent...\"\nThe Saintess feels a pang of pity every time she looks at Seo Ah.\nWhat she did to the Saintess in the laboratory was nothing compared to this.\nMaybe because the Saintess was a higher-ranking person, she didn’t do things like marking on her body.\nBut Seo Ah’s treatment was different.\n\"Well, the visible scars are all gone now.\"\nThe scars are gone cleanly.\n\"But the visible ones are just that. There’s too much mixed in, so it can’t be fully treated.\"\nThis isn’t the right way to handle a human.\nThere was a time when she tried to treat a monster.\nIt feels similar to that time.\n\"Can you restore her eyes to the way they were?\"\n\"If I force it, I can. But it’s no longer in the realm of treatment… the symptoms of her turning into a dragon, right? You said the horns are starting to appear. You’re controlling her magic to hold it back, right?\"\n\"For now.\"\n\"One thing... can I try something?\"\nThe Saintess has something she wants to do.\nTo help Seo Ah, and also to satisfy her curiosity.\n\"What do you want to do?\"\n\"I suppose you could call it inner penetration. Like what I did to you...\"\n\"No.\"\nIt couldn’t be.\nShe remembers the attempt to destroy memories.\nShihu refuses immediately.\n\"I understand you don’t trust me, but you can come in too. You’ll be able to see Seo Ah’s state most directly, won’t you?\"\nThis is the most certain thing.\n\"...Go ahead.\"\n\"Alright, then. [Treatment starting!]\"\nBang.\nWith the sound of space bursting, the surrounding environment changes.\n\"Usually, in here, the patient’s memories or inner world are reflected, and what moves is usually the patient’s own consciousness, or their unconscious mind.\"\nSometimes, like in Shihu’s case, characters in the memory can move by themselves.\nShihu saw Seo Ah’s image move in the memory.\nIn the case of family or close friends, they sometimes appear in an active form in others' memories.\n\"It’s dark.\"\nJust as expected.\nThe inner world is just dark.\nThis is especially true for patients of this kind.\nAnd since Seo Ah is sleeping, it might be why.\nIt might be better to look at Seo Ah’s memories first.\n\"Wait, someone’s there.\"\nShihu keeps watch ahead.\nIt’s Seo Ah’s world, but it’s not Seo Ah.\n\"Who... oh, that’s...\"\nThe outline soon becomes clear.\nIt’s Shihu.\nBut it’s the Shihu drawn in Seo Ah’s consciousness.\n\"It’s... me?\"\nSince Seo Ah had Shihu in her world, it’s not strange for Shihu to appear in Seo Ah’s world as well.\nThe fake Shihu speaks.\n\"Ah, hello. Shihu. Have you seen the ending?\"\nIt says something incomprehensible.\nThe fake Shihu is smiling.\n\"What?\"\n\"Not yet? It should be wrapping up by now. The doctor’s probably dead, the big companies are all broken, and the government’s malfunctioning... the attempts to take the power from the Awakened must’ve been well stopped, right?\"\n\"What are you talking about?\"\nThis is the Shihu that appeared in Seo Ah’s world.\nSo is this the version of Shihu that Seo Ah sees?\n\"...This is strange. A different entity can’t appear before the patient. This shouldn’t happen.\"\nThe Saintess murmurs.\nThe fake Shihu glances at the Saintess and laughs, as if finding it amusing.\n\"What is this? The Saintess? Is this how you looked?\"\n\"Do you... know me?\"\nThe Saintess is confused.\nEvery personality that appears in Seo Ah’s world should be bound by Seo Ah’s own limits.\nShe shouldn’t know the Saintess.\nIt’s possible the doctor told her.\n\"Anyway, Shihu, it seems like none of the things I said were successful. Nothing’s really efficient, huh? If you want to correct your mistakes, you should just kill Seo Ah.\"\nCould the existence of this fake Shihu be caused by the drug?\nIt’s clear that this fake Shihu is an incomprehensible entity.\n\"Go straight toward your goal. Living like a parasite with Seo Ah, barely hanging on, isn’t the same.\"\nIs this really how Seo Ah perceives Shihu?\nIt’s strange.\nIt’s all twisted.\n\"No.\"\n\"What do you mean, no? You can’t have that attitude. Seo Ah is hoping that you’ll be the hero who saves the world.\"\n\"...\"\n\"It’s always been like that. She never gave up on you.

      "content": "\"Pull yourself together, we need to make a happy ending.\"\nThe fake Han Shihu sneers.\n\"Disappear!\"\nThe Saintess shouts.\nBoom.\nThe world bursts open.\nThe appearance of the fake Han Shihu vanishes, and the scenery changes.\n\"Now, the real memories will appear.\"\nHere, Seo Ah will be visible, the Saintess mutters.\nA house comes into view.\nIt’s the house where Seo Ah used to live.\nThe sound of rain pouring down.\nSeo Ah is sitting on the concrete yard, getting drenched in the rain.\n\"Seo Ah—\"\n\"Wait, you can’t just talk to me like that.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"We’re replaying the memory. If we interfere, it could distort the memory itself. Maybe we should just watch and not interfere.\"\nThe Saintess also wanted to see the real Seo Ah’s memories.\nThis time, the goal isn’t to destroy the memories.\nShe watches from a distance, observing Seo Ah.\nThe rain doesn’t stop.\nSeo Ah stays seated.\nShe’s waiting for Han Shihu.\nEven though she knows he won’t come.\n\"Ah...\"\nSeo Ah smiles.\n\"Ah ha... ha...\"\nThen silence again.\nShe stays in the rain for a long time.\n\"Let’s go to the next memory...\"\n\"Wait, just wait a moment. Maybe I can talk to her—\"\nSeo Ah turns toward them.\n\"Shihu?\"\nShe saw him.\nThe Saintess steps back, as if unsure of what to do.\nHan Shihu runs to Seo Ah.\n\"Shihu?\"\nSeo Ah greets him with joy.\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Are you back? Really?\"\nNo.\nIt’s not real.\nIt’s just a memory.\nNo, if I can twist the memory and create happy ones, wouldn’t that be a good thing?\n\"Yeah.\"\nIt’s a lie.\n\"Ah, ha, hehe. I’m so glad. Ah... thank you. You must be busy!\"\nSlowly, Han Shihu begins to understand what’s going on.\nIt was right after he entered the academy.\nWhen Seo Ah had asked him to go stargazing with her.\n\"No.\"\n\"Well, should we go inside? It’s cold if you get wet.\"\nYou’re the one...\nHan Shihu follows Seo Ah inside the room.\n\"I knew you’d come. That’s right. I believed you. You’re staying with me, right? Huh? You haven’t started hating me. I know.\"\nThe words \"I believed you\" hurt so much.\nOf course, there were reasons why they couldn’t be together, but the reason they couldn’t be was also for Seo Ah’s sake...\nThis is right.\nThis is the right choice.\n\"Did you come back because you were worried?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nThat's right. It had to be this way.\n\"You must be busy. You have plans... I know there's something else.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Anyway, with the weather like this, we can't see the stars. We’ll do it later. It's fine, we can just hang out later.\"\nThis is how it should’ve been.\nI should have gone to Seo Ah.\nI should’ve done this for real.\nAs I was wondering what more I should say, the scene changes.\nBoom-!\nIt bursts open.\nWe shift to another memory.\n\"Ah, did you want to talk more?\"\nThe Saintess approaches.\n\"It’s because Seo Ah almost made eye contact with me.\"\n\"...Right.\"\n\"And don’t mistake these memories for real life. Just like the weird version of you showed up earlier, something strange might appear... these memories could already be distorted.\"\nAnyway, it's another new memory.\nIsn’t this a good thing?\nIf I could turn all the bad memories into something good.\nIf I could change all the memories that disappointed Seo Ah.\nWouldn’t that be a good thing?\nThis time, it's Seo Ah’s house again.\nI stop as I try to enter the room.\nSeo Ah is staring at herself in the bathroom mirror.\nA suffocating silence fills the air.\nHow many minutes have passed?\nSeo Ah mutters something.\nHan Shihu gets closer, trying to listen.\n\"...Help me.\"\nBut there is no one to help her.\n\"It's hard...\"\nHan Shihu wants to approach her immediately.\nBut he suppresses the impulse.\nHe wants to scream that he can help her.\nBut that would just be a lie.\nThis is just a memory.\nIt’s not real.\n\"You’re the one who can help me, right?\"\nWho can help her?\nSeo Ah speaks to herself.\nTo something beyond herself.\n\"Please...\"\nShe says in a small voice.\nMuttering quietly, but it can’t be heard.\n\"Really? You’ll help me?\"\nThen, suddenly, her voice rises.\nShe asks with a hopeful tone.\n\"That’s right... ahaha...\"\nThe Seo Ah in the mirror doesn’t respond.\nA staring contest with her own reflection.\nAnd silence.\nSeo Ah stands there for a long time.\nShe almost looks like she’s fallen asleep standing up.\nThen, she opens her eyes again.\n\"Ha...\"\nShe sighs.\nAnd looks at the mirror.\n\"I’ll try... I’ll try to make it work...\"\n\"Huh?\"\nShe makes eye contact with the Seo Ah in the mirror.\nShe recognizes Han Shihu’s presence.\n\"Han Shihu?\"\nSeo Ah rushes out of the bathroom.\nHan Shihu couldn’t possibly be here at this time.\n\"Ah, yeah. Seo Ah.\"\nThe Saintess quickly moves aside.\nSeo Ah doesn’t notice her.\nIt’s better if the Saintess doesn’t get involved in the conversation. It would complicate things.\n\"Wh-what are you doing here?\"\nSeo Ah looks around the room.\nThe used drugs.\nThe syringes.\nThere’s a lot of stuff Han Shihu shouldn’t find out about.\n\"What... when did you come in? Did... did you see it? Huh? Why are you...\"\nHan Shihu wonders how to respond.\nShould he say he’s looking through her memories?\n\"Yeah, that's right. Han Shihu, Han Shihu, listen up, I don’t know why you're here, but—\"\nSeo Ah starts speaking rapidly, as if the situation is urgent.\n\"Listen carefully! Seo Ah can’t use these drugs anymore. Do you see the syringes and the bottles? Seo Ah’s in a drug addiction state, but she can still be saved. I’m trying, but I’m reaching my limits.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nThis isn't the line I expected.\n\"You came back because of Seo Ah, right? Huh? Find a way as quickly as you can. You're the protagonist, you can do it.\"\n\"Protagonist?\"\n\"You have to save Seo Ah. Our childhood friend is dying, ugh, damn it, it hurts like hell. Anyway, save her somehow. I was going to come find you, but Seo Ah didn’t want that.\"\nThis doesn’t sound like Seo Ah’s memory.\nIt doesn’t sound like something she would say.\nI’ve heard of dissociative identities before.\nThis situation feels like it’s linked to that.\n\"You need to be here. If I were a protagonist like you, I’d have saved her by now. Oh, you should quit the academy quickly. All those people are bad.\"\nIt’s like she’s sharing a perspective with Han Shihu.\nIt’s strange, speaking with knowledge of the future.\nThese are words that Seo Ah at this point couldn’t have said.\nHas the memory been twisted?\nIt’s possible.\nIt’s something the Saintess warned me about.\n\"What are you saying?\"\n\"First, the doctor, that bastard... The academy and the government-related stuff... Oh, I can’t even remember it now. Damn, is this a hallucination? No, it can’t be.\"\n\"Seo Ah?\"\nHan Shihu calls her name.\n\"No, I’m not Seo Ah... Ah, what was it... Anyway, I’m not. Seo Ah’s sleeping right now.\"\n\"Sleeping?\"\n\"I put her to sleep. It’s pitiful. I’ll take the pain for now. If I do that, Seo Ah will be fine... I’ll help, so go quickly and get a proper doctor.\"\nSeo Ah sways, clutching her head.\nShe looks like she's in pain.\n\"Are you okay—\"\n\"Go quickly. I can’t last much longer... I’m being consumed. The drug’s effect is too strong. Hurry. I don’t want to stay like this either.\"\nSeo Ah urges him.\n\"When this is all over... then I won’t be needed anymore. Then you and Seo Ah can just live happily together.\"\n\"You, what are you...\"\nThere’s someone else there besides Seo Ah.\nHan Shihu knows that much.\nAt the same time, there’s a sense of determination to protect Seo Ah.\nIt’s someone unknown, but it’s still Seo Ah.\nAn incomprehensible situation.\n\"Ah, if you want to distinguish me from Seo Ah, ask if you can see a number in front of you. If you can, it’s me. If not, it’s Seo Ah. Got it? Got it?\"\n\"Yeah, got it.\"\nSeo Ah had once mentioned there being something like a timer in front of her eyes.\nHan Shihu feels overwhelmed by the excessive amount of information.\nHe doesn’t know what’s going on.\nBoom-!\nThe scene changes again.\nThis time, it's the house again.\nThe Saintess steps back, and Han Shihu approaches Seo Ah.\nThe house is a mess.\nSeo Ah is using drugs.\nShe’s filling a syringe with the substance.\n\"Ah, Shihu?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"You found a way, right? I’m sure I said... I thought you could do it.\"\nNo, I haven’t found a way.\nI’ve just been jumping between these memories.\nThis isn’t real.\n\"Sorry.\"\nHe apologizes.\nThere’s no way to help.\nIt’s from the past.\n\"Huh? You couldn’t find a way? Am I supposed to keep living like this? Ahaha. It’s fine. It’s not that bad. Seo Ah didn’t get addicted for no reason.\"\nNo matter how much the memories are changed, the truth doesn’t change.\nHan Shihu couldn’t help Seo Ah.\n\"Sorry...\"\n\"You didn’t do anything because you didn’t like Seo Ah. You could’ve found a way. Or, was it me you didn’t like? Sorry, for being an outsider. Didn’t you trust me?\"\n\"I...\"\n\"Seo Ah’s asleep again. I’ll use the drugs instead of her. She’s afraid of the syringe. One addict is enough for me.\"\nSeo Ah’s hand holding the syringe trembles.\nThere are a lot of wounds on her hands.\nThe mirror in the bathroom, which was fine in the last memory, is broken.\nDid she break the mirror?\n\"Who’s that—\"\nSeo Ah looks behind Han Shihu.\nWhite hair is visible.\nThe Saintess cannot be noticed.\nThey need to move to the next memory.\nBoom!\nThe scene changes again.\nStill, it’s inside the house.\nBut now, the interior is even more dilapidated.\nThe lights don’t work.\nIt’s dark outside.\nBut vaguely, the outline is visible.\nSeo Ah is bound by chains and ropes.\nShe’s tied to a metal structure.\nSeo Ah is trapped in her own house.\nWhy? Who tied her up?\nA key is lying far away on the floor.\nThe key is for unlocking the rusted padlock on the chains.\n\"Seo Ah?\"\nHan Shihu approaches her.\n\"Hey, if you go recklessly...\"\nThe Saintess tries to stop him, but it’s too late.\nHan Shihu is already checking on Seo Ah’s condition.\nHe doesn’t know who tied her up, but now he understands the nature of the chains in Seo Ah’s house.\n\"Ugh?\"\nSeo Ah reacts to Han Shihu’s appearance.\nShe’s awake.\nSeo Ah is disturbingly awake, sharply aware.\n\"Are, are you okay? Who did this?\"\n\"Medicine, quickly, give me the medicine.\"\n\"Where is the medicine?\"\n\"I threw it away. Seo Ah threw it. Over by the sewer next to the house. Hurry. I’m dying. I didn’t know it would hurt this much.\"\nSeo Ah threw away the medicine herself.\nHan Shihu thinks he knows who tied her up.\nIt was none other than Seo Ah herself.\nThere was a sentence in her journal about throwing away the medicine.\nWas that from that time?\n\"It was a mistake. Medicine. Some medicine. The key’s over there. Unlock it. I’ll go get it. Aaah, it hurts...\"\nThis is just a distorted memory.\nIt’s a memory altered by Han Shihu’s intervention.\nHe wishes it didn’t happen for real.\n\"12 minutes have passed. Ah. It hurts. Ugh... hurry, hurry. I can’t breathe, hurry, agh.\"\nThe timer shows minus 12 minutes.\nSeo Ah has barely held on until this point.\n\"Medicine, medicine, drugs, anything.\"\n\"Let’s skip ahead.\"\nHan Shihu can’t watch any longer.\nThe Saintess agrees.\nHan Shihu can’t help the Seo Ah in this memory.\nBoom!\nThe next memory.\nStill, Seo Ah is tied up.\nHer mouth is open, craving the medicine.\n\"...This memory is the same?\"\nHan Shihu asks the Saintess.\n\"No, this is definitely a different memory... Maybe it’s because it’s such a traumatic memory... Let’s move to the next one.\"\nBoom!\nThe same place appears.\nSeo Ah is still tied up.\nBoom!\nSeo Ah is still there.\nThere are signs of her struggling.\nA little bit of bodily fluids and blood are flowing.\nBoom, boom, boom...\nHan Shihu skips through the memories about a dozen times, but it’s still the same place.\nThe nightmare never ends.\nSeo Ah is still tied up, her face frozen with drool.\nThere’s liquid pooled on the floor as if it came from her body.\n\"...This...\"\nThe Saintess says in a trembling voice.\n\"I’ve been focusing on the most intense memories... but how long has she been like this...\"\nNormally, the gaps between memories are long.\nBut the intensity of the pain was so high that this happened.\nEven so, usually, there are only two or three repetitions before moving on to a different memory.\nSomething went terribly wrong with Seo Ah.\n\"Still here...\"\nShe’s been trapped here.\nOf course.\nNo one came to save her.\nHan Shihu’s at the academy, and now, no one else.\nIt was reckless from the start.\nEven if she didn’t use the drugs, she couldn’t get out alone.\nShe threw the key far away.\nBoom.\nThe memory shifts again.\nSeo Ah is still in the same place.\n\"Then, who came to save Seo Ah...?\"\nThe Saintess asks.\nIf no one comes to save her, Seo Ah will die in a miserable state.\nBut Seo Ah hasn’t died.\nSomeone must have saved her.\nWho?\nHan Shihu isn’t the one.\nHe thinks he knows the answer.\nBoom!\nThe Saintess tries again to shift the memory, but only the painful memories of Seo Ah repeat.\nThe same place.\nThe same figure.\n\"3...\"\nFor a moment, Seo Ah mutters.\nShe speaks with a despairing smile.\n\"3 o’clock...\"\nNow it’s minus 3 hours.\nShe tried to kill herself a long time ago, but failed.\nShe realized that a person couldn’t die just from biting their tongue.\nShe believes at least 30 years have passed.\nThe timer is lying.\nThat’s how Seo Ah feels.\nUntil someone comes to save her, 30 hours.",

Back and forth.\nIt shakes side to side too.\nSqueaking.\nNon-stop.\nIt continues until Seo Ah gets up from the chair.\nSeo Ah stands up and brings a journal from the drawer.\nIt's a journal Han Shihu has seen before.\nThe weather today.\nYoo Seo Ah turns her head and looks out the window.\nIt’s clear.\n<The weather is clear.> <The weather is clear.> <The weather is clear.> <The weather is>\nShe writes that far, but the pen slips from her hand.\nYoo Seo Ah stares blankly at the pen she’s holding.\nShe tries to write again.\nShe moves her hand, placing the pen on the page.\nYes.\nIt’s nothing more than the act of moving her hand.\nIt’s not writing; it’s scribbling.\nSo Yoo Seo Ah sets the pen down.\nIt’s a journal, not a scribble book.\nBut it’s ruined now.\nShe stares blankly at the journal.\n<Shihu will forgive me.>\nA sentence written at the top of the page.\nThe hope that if she quits the drugs, she’ll be able to live with Shihu.\nIt’s all over.\nShe failed.\nCreak.\nShe falls into thought on the rocking chair.\nThe bird chirps again.\n\"Seo Ah?\"\n\"...\"\nNo response, even though he speaks.\n\"Sorry.\"\nHan Shihu apologizes.\nHonestly, he’s not sure exactly what he’s apologizing for anymore.\nMaybe Seo Ah doesn’t even want an apology.\nIt’s just that every time Han Shihu looks at Seo Ah, he feels guilty.\nThe creaking chair.\nSeo Ah gets up from the chair again.\nShe places the journal back in its original spot.\nThud.\nShe drops it on the floor.\nHer hand loses strength, and it falls.\nBut after trying again, she succeeds.\nThere, the chains that once bound Yoo Seo Ah can be seen.\nThe broken lock, too.\n\"Doctor...\"\nThere’s no malice in Seo Ah’s words.\nIn fact, there’s goodwill.\nThe same goodwill she once showed to Han Shihu.\n\"You saved me, good person...\"\nBuried deep in Yoo Seo Ah’s consciousness is that idea.\nThe doctor is a good person.\nAnd in fact, the doctor is a good person.\nIf the doctor hadn’t saved her, Yoo Seo Ah would have died.\nMaybe Han Shihu should thank the doctor.\nBecause the doctor saved Seo Ah, she’s alive.\nA good person.\nA good person couldn’t possibly be.\nHan Shihu mutters.\n\"No, if the doctor hadn’t given her the drugs from the start, none of this would have happened.\"\nIf it hadn’t been for the doctor, she wouldn’t have even gotten to the point of dying.\nBut at this point, Yoo Seo Ah can’t hear anything.\nFor 30 hours, her self has been crushed like mud, ground into a blender in hell.\nIt’ll still take time before Yoo Seo Ah is fully recovered to the point of thinking clearly.\nShe’ll still have to take the medicine given to her by the doctor and come to Han Shihu asking for more money.\nThe point is, Yoo Seo Ah right now cannot make rational decisions.\nIn game terms, it’s like all her stats have dropped below half.\nHer health, intelligence, everything.\nBut after recovery, she’ll return to half of her original state.\nShe’ll regain enough intelligence to come to Han Shihu and ask to borrow money.\n\"...Let’s move on.\"\nHan Shihu says to the Saintess.\nThere’s nothing more to do in this memory.\nIt’ll only get more pitiful.\n\"Okay, let’s go to the next memory.\"\n\"Ah, wait.\"\nHan Shihu stops the Saintess again.\n\"What is it?\"\n\"...You said we’re watching memories, right?\"\n\"That’s right.\"\n\"Then, are we looking at memories that the drugs have erased?\"\nIt’s strange when you think about it.\nSeo Ah seems to have gone back to before using the drugs.\nSo what are we watching now?\n\"We can’t see memories that were fully erased. We’re reconstructing the scene with memories that are still in the patient’s mind. It’s a trauma healing skill, basically.\"\n\"So, the memory hasn’t been erased?\"\n\"The drugs used for resetting probably don’t erase memories. It’s not easy to selectively erase memories up until a certain point. I’ve tried it myself.\"\nThe Saintess’s ability is somewhat similar to the memory-erasing drugs.\n\"Is that so?\"\n\"And what we’re seeing now is just showing scenes similar to the real past. It’s not actually real.\"\n\"So how does it affect the actual memory?\"\nThe Saintess has twisted Han Shihu’s memories.\nShe’s used it when it’s been useful, but Han Shihu doesn’t really like her.\n\"So, this is... hmm... like submitting a revised version of what you wish the memory would be? It’s not guaranteed to change, and it’s hard to make big changes to the memory.\"\nThe chair Seo Ah is sitting on creaks.\nShe stares blankly at the empty space ahead.\n\"Actually, it's strange for us to suddenly appear in front of the past Seo Ah. Memories that don’t make sense can’t be fixed. A plausible scenario is necessary.\"\nThat’s why so much effort was put into filtering out Yoo Seo Ah from Han Shihu’s memories.\nBut in the end, it failed.\n\"...Is that how it feels? But it seems like we’re not just seeing memories.\"\nThe words of the fake Han Shihu still linger in his mind.\n\"It’s because it’s projecting the inner world. It’s hard to explain in words.\"\nThe chair creaks again.\n\"So, does that mean we can’t stay here forever?\"\nHan Shihu asks.\nCan’t he stay with the past Seo Ah?\n\"This memory is already over. Seo Ah is just repeating the same actions. There’s no more unusual event.\"\nAn ended memory.\n\"So, even if I keep waiting, it will stay like this?\"\n\"It’s a world created based on short, intense memories. It’s better to move on to the next memory at the right time.\"\nIt seems that way.\n\"Can we choose which memory to see?\"\n\"Right now, we’re mainly seeing intense memories, sorted by time.\"\n\"It’s adjustable?\"\n\"Uh... what kind of memory do you want to see?\"\nThe Saintess hesitates before speaking.\n\"...The doctor.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Any memory that involves the doctor.\"\n\"That’s not possible. The memories are chosen based on themes or moods. And the doctor hasn’t appeared in the memories until now... In fact, usually, only the patient’s own memories appear.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Well, if you think of it as a simulation based on memories, introducing someone other than the patient reduces the accuracy, right?\"\n\"...That’s a strange ability.\"\n\"Even so, sometimes, other people besides the patient do appear.\"\nIt’s rare, but it happens when the Saintess uses her abilities.\n\"In cases where they’re as close as family. It was like that with you too. Seo Ah appeared. Of course, it was a version of her that you recognized, not the real Seo Ah.\"\n\"So, does that mean in Seo Ah’s memory, I’m the way she sees me?\"\n\"Probably...\"\nHan Shihu feels conflicted.\nIs it because of the drugs?\nBut even so, he didn’t live in a way where he didn’t care if Seo Ah died.\nIt almost feels like the fake Han Shihu is lecturing the real one.\nTelling him to deal with Seo Ah and get things done.\nWhat’s there to do?\nWhat’s so important that it would justify killing Seo Ah?\n\"Then, can I talk to that guy again?\"\nHe means the fake Han Shihu.\n\"That, maybe... if we do this—\"\nBoom.\nA black world unfolds.\nEverything around is pitch black.\nIt’s so dark that Han Shihu can barely make out the Saintess’s position.\n\"What is this place?\"\n\"Maybe a lobby, or just a place where the patient’s inner world is vaguely visible. It’s pretty dark for Seo Ah... normally, it’s not like this.\"\nYoo Seo Ah’s inner world is simply dark.\nI wonder what it was like before it became this dark.\nHan Shihu takes a few steps forward.\nAfter just a few steps, someone starts to appear in front of him.\nThe fake Han Shihu.\nA blurry figure starts to speak.\n\"...So, you’ve made up your mind, right?\"\nThe decision to kill Seo Ah.\nThe fake asks the real one.\n\"You’re telling me to get rid of Seo Ah. But what exactly do you get from going that far? If you were me, you’d know Seo Ah is the most important.\"\n\"What are you talking about? You’ve been suffering because of Seo Ah. You’re struggling to bring back a corpse. Seo Ah wants to die. She’s not dying because she doesn’t want to make you sad.\"\n\"...What’s the gain from Seo Ah’s death?\"\n\"World peace.\"\n\"I don’t care.\"\nHan Shihu isn’t interested in chasing after such an abstract goal.\n\"Your mental stability, physical pleasure, happiness... wealth, power, honor, all the good things. In fact, by then, Seo Ah probably won’t even be a memory.\"\n\"What are you? You’re not me. You just look like me.\"\nThe fake Han Shihu pauses, thinking for a moment, trying to figure out what to say.\n\"Ah... I never thought about that. Who am I?\"\n\"Right.\"\n\"Maybe I’m the version of Han Shihu that Seo Ah liked the most?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"I at least don’t sneak around stealing other people’s memories.\"\nThe Saintess, who had been listening to the conversation, lowers her head, clearly feeling guilty.\n\"...I’m different from you.\"\nHan Shihu says.\nHe can’t choose to abandon Seo Ah.\n\"I won’t abandon Seo Ah.\"\nThe fake Han Shihu laughs when he hears that.\n\"Heh.\"\nAs if it’s ridiculous.\n\"What are you talking about? You already abandoned her. If you don’t like it, you erase the memories with drugs, over and over. Seo Ah seems perfect for being treated like a toy.\"\nIt’s true that the memories were erased.\nBut it was just to ease Seo Ah’s pain.\nThere was no other way.\nBut deep inside, Han Shihu still questions if it was the right choice.\n\"Shut up.\"\nSo, Han Shihu is just angry.\nAngry at himself.",

But what happens if an actor refuses to play their role and runs away?\"\nThe play falls apart.\nThe actor refuses to perform.\n\"The whole play falls apart. No happy ending, no protagonist getting their time to shine... and world peace becomes impossible.\"\n\"In some ways, Yoo Seo Ah is a traitor to humanity. She knew all this, yet she still did this.\"\n\"What kind of absurd reasoning is that...\"\n\"I was like her conscience, always telling her what the right path was. Yet in the end, this disaster happened.\"\nThe fake Han Shihu sighs.\nThen he raises his voice, reaching the part that doesn’t matter even if the Saintess hears it.\n\"Everything I’ve said is true. At least from Yoo Seo Ah’s perspective. Did I say it was an inner world?\"\nHe asks the Saintess.\n\"Uh... I’ve never seen anything like you, but...\"\nThe Saintess stutters.\n\"That’s what it’s like. Seo Ah’s inner world is like this. I was explaining it from Seo Ah’s perspective. After all, now she’s forgotten everything and can’t explain it herself.\"\n\"...I...\"\nHan Shihu still couldn’t accept the truth.\nThe protagonist?\nOf a play?\nHe’s being told he exists within some constructed story.\nBut that can’t be true.\nThis is undeniably real.\nAn actor going off script?\nNow that he thinks about it, it makes sense.\nThe fake Han Shihu tells Han Shihu he has a purpose.\nSeo Ah expects Han Shihu to do something.\nShe’s waiting for him to act.\nAs the protagonist.\nTo save the world.\n\"Aren’t you supposed to be a great hero who saves the world? Huh? The Saintess probably feels the same way.\"\n\"...That’s nonsense.\"\nHe can’t be that great of a person.\nNo one is born as the protagonist from the start.\nHe understands that everyone is the protagonist of their own life.\nBut if life itself is designed, that’s a problem.\nThe fake Han Shihu lowers his voice again.\n\"Thinking about it, it’s strange. Why didn’t Seo Ah tell you this truth? If she told you, you’d just know you’re a character in a story, and the future is already decided.\"\n\"Make some sense.\"\n\"I’ve been saying it over and over. What are you doing? The real Han Shihu already saved the world.\"\n\"......\"\nIt’s just the voice of Seo Ah’s inner world.\nThere’s no evidence.\nIt could just be a trick to disturb Han Shihu’s mind.\nBut for some reason, it feels oddly believable.\nAfter all the events and the things said by Seo Ah or the fake Han Shihu, it feels true.\n\"The script is a mess. Then, we have to improvise. Don’t you know what ad-libs are? Famous actors leave their best scenes like that.\"\nThe script suddenly became strange.\nThe audience observing must be confused.\nThen they would think, “Oh, this must be part of the play.”\nAnd as they watch, it will seem okay.\n\"So, what do you want me to do?\"\nEven if this is true, does it change anything?\nEven if everything the fake Han Shihu said was true.\n\"The only ones who know this are you and Seo Ah. The doctor... might have caught on, but he would never guess. This world is fake.\"\nYoo Seo Ah had already murmured to the doctor that Han Shihu was the protagonist and so on.\nThe doctor probably brushed it off as strange.\n\"Well, what does it matter what you do? You’re just a made-up character. There’s an actual storyline, and... this world is just... an ‘if’ story.\"\n\"Whatever you do doesn’t matter.\"\n\"The only ones who know this are you and Seo Ah... No, now it’s just you.\"\nThe fake Han Shihu’s form disappears.\nWhat remains is a whispering voice and darkness.\n\"Do what you want. Seo Ah only deceived you. It’s all fake, so what does it matter?\"\n\"Logically speaking, there’s no way something like Awakened powers or magic exists. What is this, a shonen manga?\"\n\"Gates, dungeons, items. These are all things you’d expect to see in a game.\"\nHan Shihu had suspected for a long time that something was off with this world.\nSomeone swings a sword and gains a swordsmanship skill, runs fast and gets a sprinting skill...\nIt’s not even child’s play.\nIt’s definitely strange.\nAnd thinking about it makes it seem even stranger.\n\"The creator of the original story is like a god. And the god abandoned this world. The actor threw away the script and started acting on their own.\"\n\"If there’s no god, there’s no justice. There’s no absolute standard for judging sin. Whether it’s morals or laws, without a god, it all appeals to vague conscience.\"\n\"So, the ones who tormented you aren’t being punished. This is a world abandoned by the god, the creator. The storyline that should’ve been about righteous punishment is gone, and it turned into the opposite.\"\nHan Shihu was lost in thought, immersed in the darkness.\nIndeed, neither Han Shihu nor Yoo Seo Ah received any help.\nHe had tried to appeal to the authorities.\nTo the people he was told to trust.\nTo the institutions that seemed kind.\nBut that feeling.\nThe despair.\nThe hopelessness when the last bastion you trusted falls.\nThe people who said they would help responded with indifference when he actually asked for help.\nIt had always been like that.\nThey were like the filthy creatures in the slums, the ones kept alive only because they couldn’t be killed.\nOnly someone who has experienced that kind of frustration would understand.\nHis heart breaks.\nHe feels drained.\nHis voice trembles, and he can’t speak.\nBut he endured!\nHan Shihu was the protagonist.\nHe had to protect Seo Ah.\nThen, one moment, through a twist of fate, Han Shihu left Yoo Seo Ah, and by coincidence, Seo Ah used the medicine given by the doctor, and by coincidence, by coincidence...\nMisfortune leads to more misfortune.\nWhat kind of story is this written by some bastard?\n\"Ha... ha... Yeah. You’re right.\"\n\"-Han Shihu?\"\nThe Saintess had been calling Shihu beside him.\n\"Are... are you really okay?\"\nThere’s no way he’s okay.\nAnd at this point, it doesn’t matter anymore.\n\"Let’s go out. My ability’s at its limit anyway...\"\nBoom.\nThe space shatters.\nHe exits the hallucinatory world.\nSeo Ah is still asleep.\nSeo Ah had a secret she never told Han Shihu.\nThis world was fake.\nThat’s why she had struggled so much with her own existence.\nHan Shihu stares at Seo Ah blankly.\nWas this the only way to understand her?\n\"...Han Shihu? Are you okay?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"I can go now, right? I want to rest.\"\nThe Saintess speaks uneasily.\nThe contact with the fake Han Shihu was the real issue.\nNo matter what conversation they had, the atmosphere had shifted drastically.\n\"No.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"You’re still useful.\"\n\"Uh...\"\nHan Shihu reaches a conclusion.\nThe world is rotten, and everything is fake.\nNeither Han Shihu nor Yoo Seo Ah did anything wrong to cause this problem.\nIt’s the world itself that’s fundamentally broken.\nClick.\nIn an instant, the Saintess’s collar is snapped on.\n\"Ah, huh? What’s this—\"\n\"It’s meant for this purpose.\"\nIt’s better to use it on the Saintess than on Seo Ah.\nThe magic control collar is really convenient.\nHan Shihu had learned that there are some limitations when using it, but, well, no problem.\n\"Sh-Shihu?\"\n\"You like this kind of thing, don’t you? You liked being stepped on by me, remember?\"\nHan Shihu laughs.\nNow he’s unsure if the fake Han Shihu he saw earlier was really fake.\nSomething inside Han Shihu has broken.\nThere’s no longer a reason to treat another being as an individual.\nThey’re just puppets, being controlled in the same way.\nFakes.\n\"T-this is—\"\nThe Saintess trembles.\nShe’s trembling with an abnormal fear.\nHan Shihu knows.\nShe had already been caught in the lab before.\nSo, maybe she has a trauma with being caught like this?\nBut he doesn’t care anymore.\nNow, he’ll do anything for Seo Ah.\nAnything.\nThere are no limits.",

      "content": "Han Shihu had one rule.\nHe had to be a righteous person.\nMinimizing harm to others.\nContributing to society.\nRisking his life to save others.\nSo, at least he kept the minimum line.\n\"I see now why the doctor used the drugs.\"\nIt must be incredibly convenient to control people.\nHan Shihu began to understand why the doctor had been spreading the drugs everywhere.\nIndeed, the drug is useful.\nThough he's curious if it works on someone like the Saintess, who can cleanse herself.\nHe understands.\nThere's no need to trap or control anyone directly. Just give them the drug, and you can turn them into a dog that will do anything. It's so convenient.\nHow is this any different from what the doctor did to Seo Ah?\n\"Well, I won’t do anything too harsh. Seo Ah is here, after all.\"\nThere's really no need to put the collar on the Saintess.\nHe only did it because it would be bothersome if she resisted.\n\"Why... why is this happening?\"\nThe Saintess tries to remove the collar, but it’s impossible.\n\"We’re going somewhere.\"\nHan Shihu smiles as he speaks.\n\"Let me go.\"\n\"You only need to help me a little. I’ll finish this while Seo Ah is still asleep.\"\nIt’ll take quite a while before Seo Ah wakes up.\n\"Let’s move to another place.\"\nWith that, Han Shihu pulls her along by the collar.\nHe wouldn’t have done this if it were Seo Ah.\nBut with others, it doesn’t matter.\nIt’s all a fictitious story, isn’t it?\nAnd they’re just characters in that story.\nEven beyond that, Han Shihu doesn’t feel like the people around him are really human.\nThey’re all disgusting people and idiots everywhere.\nHe steps outside and walks a bit.\nA building, once used as a police station, comes into view.\nIt’s half-collapsed, a characteristic of the place.\nBang.\nHe throws the Saintess onto the ground, like she’s a burden.\nIt’s a holding cell made of concrete floor.\nIt’s a place he had prepared beforehand.\nIt’s not too far from the new house.\n\"Ugh...\"\nIt’s a space that could be used as a prison.\nCreeeak.\nHe opens a locked shelf in the corner of the cell.\nInside, there’s a box.\nIt contains the various types of drugs that Seo Ah used.\nHe couldn’t store all the drugs at home.\nThere’s work to do here.\nHe pulls out a syringe.\n\"What are you going to do?\"\nThe Saintess speaks with a voice full of fear.\nThis wasn’t the outcome she expected.\nShe thought she’d just help with Seo Ah’s treatment.\nShe thought she could pay back Han Shihu for what happened.\nIt was already coercive enough to bring her here against her will, but she never expected this.\n\"I’m going to use the drugs.\"\n\"I... I’m not affected by them.\"\nThe Saintess hurriedly speaks.\nTreatment is possible, after all.\nSomeone with better healing abilities than Yoo Seo Ah is here.\n\"Just because of the healing ability? Just let me go. I’ll cooperate without doing this...\"\n\"Hmm.\"\n\"It won’t work on me. I’m not affected by it.\"\nThat’s a lie.\nShe’s subtly addicted to the drugs.\nThe Saintess occasionally used the drugs when she was feeling bad.\nIt’s a mild level of addiction for the amount of drugs she took, but it’s not without effect.\nHan Shihu controls her magic with the collar.\nNo one knows what will happen if he uses the drugs here.\n\"Are you scared?\"\nHan Shihu nonchalantly fills the syringe with the solution.\n\"Don’t do this...\"\n\"Seo Ah must have been scared too.\"\nThe Saintess can’t look away from her own actions.\nShe sent Seo Ah to the lab in her place.\nHan Shihu holds the syringe.\nThe Saintess shudders uneasily.\n\"I still think this isn’t right.\"\n\"What isn’t right?\"\n\"This... this isn’t something Seo Ah would approve of.\"\nIt’s laughable for her to bring up Seo Ah now.\n\"What do you think I’m trying to do?\"\nHan Shihu sneers.\n\"What? You think I’m going to use the drugs?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nThat’s the right answer.\nBut it’s a little different.\n\"But I won’t use it on you.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nThen who?\n\"If you can’t treat Seo Ah, I’ll have to do it myself.\"\n\"Uh?\"\n\"And I don’t have the luxury of time to find a solution. According to that guy, we’re close to the end, but there’s been no progression in the story.\"\nThe Saintess couldn’t understand what Han Shihu was saying.\nThe conversation with the fake Han Shihu was the problem.\nHan Shihu had changed.\n\"I’m going to inject the drugs into myself.\"\nHe says it without hesitation.\n\"...What?\"\n\"I’ve been thinking about it for a long time. If your healing powers don’t work, how should I treat myself? I’ve found two methods, and this is Plan A.\"\nPlan B isn’t ready yet.\nThe last resort.\nIf things go wrong here, he’ll use it.\n\"You’re going to inject yourself with the drugs?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nHan Shihu’s purification and recovery abilities could help block the effects of the drug to some extent.\n\"Why?\"\n\"To find a way to treat Seo Ah, and if necessary, to use the drug’s power to save this world.\"\nAt this point, Han Shihu is too late.\nHe couldn’t do what he was supposed to do while trying to save Seo Ah.\nWhat Seo Ah is expecting is the Han Shihu who is a hero.\nThen he must go save the world.\nHe’ll fill the gaps in his strength with the drugs.\n\"No, no, Shihu. No matter what you heard from that fake, you shouldn’t believe it. Seo Ah is addicted...\"\n\"It’s not just because of that.\"\n\"You saw Seo Ah, right? What if you become just like her?\"\n\"If I can’t control the drugs I inject into myself... I won’t be able to cure Seo Ah’s addiction either.\"\nThe Saintess realizes that Han Shihu has been consumed by madness.\nHe wants to use the drugs too?\nIt’s no wonder that he and Seo Ah were friends.\n\"It seems like you don’t understand, but with my abilities, it’s possible.\"\nHan Shihu continues explaining.\n\"My skills improve the more I use them, and when I need them, the skills I require will suddenly appear.\"\nThe number of skills has grown and grown, surpassing one hundred.\nHan Shihu has a decent understanding of his abilities.\nIt’s not just a skill that makes him good at sword fighting.\nIt’s a power that maximizes rewards for effort.\n\"If I use the drug, I’ll develop a skill to control it. If you help me, it’ll be safer.\"\nWith that, he removes the collar from the Saintess.\nAfter all, he just needed to bring her to the holding cell.\nThe entrance to the building is locked.\nHan Shihu rolls up his sleeves.\nThe audience is just the Saintess.\nPreparation for using the drug.\nWhy is he doing this? That question floats sporadically in his mind.\nFor Seo Ah.\nThat’s why.\nThe syringe, filled with the drug, is aimed, but nothing happens.\n\"Are you really going to do this?\"\nHan Shihu doesn’t answer.\nThe Saintess tries to stop him, but she can’t.\nHer body seems to have frozen.\nShe can’t comprehend the situation.\nMaybe Han Shihu didn’t bring her here with any other intention.\n\"...Was this how Seo Ah felt?\"\nWhat was it like when Seo Ah used the drugs for the first time?\nNow, Han Shihu can finally understand Seo Ah on the same level.\nThe needle of the syringe touches his skin.\n\"......\"\n\"I might never be able to go back.\"\nI already know several people who met a tragic end due to drug addiction.\nSeo Ah is an extraordinary case as well.\n\"When I give the signal with my hand, use the healing skill.\"\nWithout waiting for the Saintess's response, I push the needle in.\nThrust.\nIt only takes a few seconds before the effects hit.\nThe drug components break through the blood-brain barrier and reach the brain.\nA shiver runs down my spine.\nInstead of blood, pleasure flows through me.\nEverything seems perfect.\nI don't even know what I was worried about until now.\nA dizzying euphoria takes over as every worry fades away.\nIt's intoxicating.\nMy vision blurs.\nAt the same time, it feels like my eyes are wide open, like I can see everything more clearly.\nA new world opens up.\nSo what if this world is fake? As long as I have the drug, I can fulfill the purpose of life.\nWhat I need isn’t a skill to block or eliminate the effects.\nWhat I need is a skill that amplifies the pleasure.\n[Purification]\nIt neutralizes the effects of the drug.\n\"Is this it...?\"\nBut it wasn’t enough.\nI need to fend off the overwhelming pleasure that's still coming.\nI have to stop it.\nThe truth is, there are plenty of ways to stop it.\nI just don’t want to.\nIt’s clear that this isn’t something that can be dealt with through willpower.\nEven my feelings for Seo Ah are starting to blur.\nI can understand why Seo Ah betrayed me now.\nThis messes with the very essence of being human.\nNinety-nine percent of my thoughts are just wishing that this moment would never end.\n[Enhancement] [Augmentation] [Purification]\nI used the skills three times in succession.\nThe pleasure fades away.\n\"...This is dangerous.\"\nI’m back to normal.\nThe aftereffects are pretty intense.\nIs this what it’s like after just one injection?\n\"Are... are you okay? Huh?\"\nThe Saintess didn’t need to help yet.\nNot yet.\n\"I’ll keep doing this until I get the skill.\"\n\"Repeat? You’re going to keep using them here?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nIs this the early signs of addiction?\nI can feel myself starting to lose my resistance to using more of the drug.\nThere’s no hesitation anymore in using it again.\nIt’s not a painful thing, it’s something enjoyable.\n\"Once I get the skill, I’ll send you home. You just have to help me until then.\"\nThe Saintess listens fairly easily, so this is the situation.\nIf she resisted more, killing her would be an option.\nI don’t want to, but I do consider it sometimes.\nI grab the syringe again.\nThrust.\nI won’t get addicted.\nIn fact, even if I do, it doesn’t matter.\nI’m doing this to figure out how to completely quit while still being addicted to the drug.\nI succeeded in purifying it.\nBut I didn’t get a new skill.\nThrust.\nI think about Seo Ah.\nI’ve been hurt by the thought that Seo Ah tried to kill me because of the drug.\nBut now, I understand.\nThis isn’t a matter of mental strength.\nPurification.\nThe drug’s effect disappears.\nI still didn’t get a new skill.\nI’ve only used it three times, and each time, I’ve just been getting rid of the drug’s effects immediately.\nBut the pleasure that overwhelms me every time I use the drug—it’s impossible to get used to it.\nHow many times did Seo Ah use this kind of drug?\nA lot.\nIt’s no wonder her condition couldn’t possibly be normal.\nThrust.\nI inject again, four times in succession.\n[Drug Tolerance I]\nI’ve gained a skill.\nThe skill I wanted.\nBuilding up tolerance will let me use stronger drugs.\nIn the end, the Saintess’s healing ability wasn’t necessary.\nEven without her, I could’ve done it on my own.\nShe was just a safety measure, in case anything went wrong.\nIn the end, the Saintess was nothing more than an observer.\n\"...Huh? Are... are you okay? Huh?\"\nThere's no way I'm okay.\nIt’s impossible to react like that to a drug the first time you use it.\nEven after using the drug four times in a row, I just stumbled for a moment and that’s it.\nI’ve crossed way beyond what should be considered normal.",

You’ll catch a cold if you sleep here.\"\nNo matter how much I nudged him, he wouldn’t wake up.\n\"Shihu?\"\nWhat had he been doing last night?\nSomething still feels off.\nIs he out doing something by himself?\nWhen he wakes up, I want to have a serious conversation with him.\nI drag Shihu to where the blanket is, to move him.\nHow tired must he be to be like this?\nI should just let him sleep.\nHis clothes are soaked.\n\"...Blood?\"\nI lift up his clothes, but I can’t see any wounds.\nI roll up his sleeves, but there are no places where blood would have come from.\n\"Huh...?\"\nThere’s something I’m missing.\nI look carefully at Shihu’s arm.\nThere’s a strangely familiar mark.\nInjection marks.\n\"Huh...?\"\nThere are several of them.\nWhy did Shihu get injections?\nCould it have been a vaccination or something? But that seems strange.\nThen, maybe just needle marks? Maybe he got pricked somewhere?\nThat’s strange too.\nIt’s really strange.\nI don’t understand at all.\nI don’t understand.\nI don’t understand.\nI don’t understand.\nI just can’t understand.\nI hold Shihu’s hand, hoping that he’ll be okay.\nHe said he was fine, so it’s fine.\nI’m fine.\nBut what if Shihu isn’t fine?\nI’m scared.\nI’m scared because Shihu told me I was being loud.\nI’m scared because it feels like more than half of my memories have evaporated.\n\"Shihu?\"\nHe’s still breathing.\nHe seems really tired.\nHe looks like he came back from a fight.\nHe looks like he barely made it home.\n\"...Shihu?\"\nIt feels like the world has twisted.\n\"Does it hurt a lot?\"\nHe looks like it does.\nThere’s a lot of cold sweat.\nIt seems dangerous.\n\"Hey, I’ll go get the medicine.\"\nI start searching through Shihu’s clothes, but I can’t find any medicine.\nI check every storage space in the house.\nBut there’s nothing.\nExcept one place.\nThe one place Shihu told me not to open.\nThe drawer at the very bottom.\nI shouldn’t open it.\nIs that a good enough reason not to open it?\nI ask myself, but I don’t have the answer.\nI feel like my head’s starting to get strange.\nFor Shihu’s sake!\nClunk.\nIt’s locked.\nHmm, did Shihu not trust me?\nClunk, clunk, clunk.\nEven shaking it doesn’t open.\nThere must be something important inside.\nIt has to be.\nIt has to be.\nShihu said he was hurt.\nA tool—people should use tools.\nSoon, I found the right tool.\nA kitchen knife.\nCreak.\nI jabbed at the drawer until the knife’s edge dulled, then twisted it into the keyhole.\nAt some point, it opens with a clink.\n\"It’s open.\"\nBut inside, there’s nothing but a strange scrap of paper.\nDid Shihu organize this?\nI pull out the scrap of paper.\n\"...Antipsychotic drugs? Uh... Delusions, hallucinations, thought disorders... Dosage...\"\nIt looks like the instructions for the drugs.\nAt least I know it’s definitely not cold medicine.\nI try to read more, but the writing’s smudged, probably because it got wet.\n\"Hmm...\"\nI drop the paper and decide to look for medicine elsewhere, but then I changed my mind.\nAfter all, if there’s an instruction manual, that must mean the drugs have been used at least once, right?\nWhat kind of drug is this?\nAntipsychotic drugs?\nThe word \"psychosis\" in there makes it creepy.\nWas there some kind of mental problem?\nWho?\nMe?\nThat’s impossible.\nThen it must be Shihu.\nNo.\nThat’s also strange.\n\"On the back... related to memory loss...\"\nI read on.\n\"-Where did you get this?\"\nShihu asks, his eyes still half-closed as he stirs awake.\nLooks like he’s up now.\n\"I’m glad. I was looking for this in case you needed it. You’re okay, right?\"\n\"Where did you get this?\"\n\"Uh, over there...\"\n\"I told you not to open it.\"\nHe looks angry.\n\"I thought you might need the medicine...\"\n\"Hah.\"\nHe sighs, staring at the broken drawer and the kitchen knife lying next to it.\n\"Sorry...?\"\nIt’s not like I did anything terribly wrong, right?\n\"Ah, my head’s killing me.\"\n\"Huh? Are you okay?\"\nShihu almost never complains about pain.\nIf he’s saying something like this, he’s really in pain.\nHe definitely needs the medicine.\n\"Ah... damn. The penalty...\"\nHis words are harsh.\nWhat penalty?\nWhat’s he been doing to get like this?\nDid he catch a bad cold because he went out?\n\"Ah, the injections hurt, didn’t they?\"\nI say it, but even to me, it sounds like a strange guess.\n\"...What?\"\n\"Isn’t that from the injections? The marks on your arm.\"\nI point to Shihu’s arm.\n\"Huh? Ah.\"\nOnly then does he notice his sleeve’s rolled up.\nHe looks flustered.\n\"Ah, yeah, something like that.\"\n\"Really? Where did you get it?\"\n\"A hospital I know.\"\n\"A hospital...?\"\nThere’s no hospital nearby.\nThe nearest one’s in the city, far away.\nShihu’s tone sounds strangely irritable.\nAm I just imagining it?\nShihu’s acting strange.\n\"Does it hurt a lot?\"\n\"Don’t worry about it. Don’t be concerned. I’m sorry. I’m just not feeling great. I’ll be fine soon.\"\n\"Okay...\"\nThe mood has turned dark.\nI was only trying to help Shihu.\nDid I end up being no help at all?\nThis is the first time something like this has happened.\nThis is the first time Shihu has acted so strange.\nIf he’s in pain, where is it?\nCould it be because of the drugs?\nIt doesn’t seem like the injection from a hospital.\nI suddenly think of the appearance of drug addicts I’ve seen on the streets.\nDrug addiction?\nCould it be Shihu?\nNo.\nThat can’t be right.\nShihu’s too smart for something like that.\nBut... just in case, next time Shihu goes out, I’ll secretly follow him.\nI’m so curious about what he’s doing.",

      "content": "I tried to see what Shihu was doing.\nThe moment I left the house to follow him, I was caught.\nIt was as if he had put some sort of tracking device on me—he noticed so quickly.\nAnd then, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, he appeared in front of me.\n\"How did you know?\"\nI had left the house at what should have been the perfect time for him not to notice.\nDid he teleport or something?\n\"I told you not to come. It’s dangerous outside.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Just stay home for a while. When I’m not here...\"\n\"......\"\nShihu is definitely acting strange.\nToo strange.\nAfter thinking about it, I wondered if maybe I had caught some kind of serious illness.\n\"Shihu, so this... is...\"\n\"What’s wrong?\"\n\"I’ve got amnesia, right? That’s it.\"\nIt’s a logical conclusion.\n\"Because suddenly I’ve grown taller, you’ve changed, the house is different, I don’t remember anything about the area around the house... And I’ve been taking all these drugs...\"\nMy memories must have been messed up.\nI must have had some kind of accident.\nShihu stays silent.\n\"Answer me. Are you planning to tell me the truth? Or are you just going to keep hiding things from me?\"\n\"Later. I’ll explain later. Not now.\"\n\"Why can’t you explain now?\"\nHe’s hiding so much from me.\nI’m disappointed.\nBut I can understand why he might be hiding things.\n\"It’s a reason you can accept. Please, let me tell you later. It’s all for you.\"\nHe says as he holds my hand.\nHis hands are warm.\n\"For me?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nWell, if that’s the case.\nI should listen to him.\nYeah.\nThat’s right.\nIt feels nice holding his hand, but...\n\"Hey, Shihu?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"I’m... hot? Are you sick?\"\nHis hand is hotter than just being warm.\nIt feels like cold sweat is dripping from him.\nShihu’s sick.\n\"No, it’s fine, don’t worry.\"\n\"No, don’t lie. You’re clearly sick.\"\nShihu’s been in bad shape lately.\nHe seems to be using a lot of drugs too.\nWhat’s going on?\n\"It’s temporary. I’m just tired from training.\"\n\"Training? What training?\"\n\"You know. The training I’m doing to protect you.\"\nI remember.\nI remember when Shihu said he’d protect me and swung his sword.\nBut does practicing swordsmanship give you a fever?\nHe just seems to be sick.\n\"...Hmm...\"\nBut I can’t help but accept it.\nEven though I don’t know what Shihu’s been doing, like cutting down on his sleep.\nI have to listen to him.\nYeah.\n\"Sorry, once everything is done... I’ll be with you all the time.\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"You promise?\"\n\"Yeah. Promise.\"\nShihu always keeps his promises.\nThen, I guess I can relax, right?\n\"But you really need to take care of your health. Don’t overdo it when you’re sick, okay?\"\n\"Don’t worry.\"\nIt’s okay, right?\nHe’s not lying, right?\nI tried to smile.\n***\nI thought I saw Shihu coming back.\nI peered through the window to check the street.\nIt was early morning again.\nWhat on earth could he have been doing?\nIt’s not just him.\nThere’s someone with Shihu.\nIt looks like they’re supporting him.\nThe long white hair stands out.\nA woman?\nWhy is someone like her with Shihu?\nShe’s a stranger to me.\nDid something bad happen to Shihu?\nShe looks dangerous.\nShihu doesn’t seem to be in a good state.\nHe’s stumbling like he’s drunk, supported by her.\n\"Who?\"\nWho is she?\nShe might be dangerous.\nShe could be connected to Shihu’s strange behavior.\n\"Who is she? Who?!\"\nI need a weapon.\nI grab the kitchen knife from the kitchen.\nThen, I rush outside.\nI’ve never fought before.\nI’m not confident I could stab someone with a kitchen knife.\n\"Who is she? Who is she?!\"\nI run out barefoot, my feet hurting.\nBut I have no choice if Shihu’s in danger.\nWhat kind of person comes back like that, saying \"don’t worry\"?\nI see Shihu and the white-haired woman.\n\"Huh?\"\nThe woman looks startled.\n\"Wh-what are you doing to Shihu? What have you done to him?\"\nI shout, holding the knife toward her.\n\"Ah, I-I’m his friend. Don’t worry.\"\n\"Liar. Shihu never said he was meeting a friend. I’ve never seen someone like you.\"\nShe’s lying.\nShe’s suspicious.\n\"...I’m a coworker, a colleague. Shihu collapsed from overworking, so I brought him back.\"\n\"A colleague?\"\n\"Something like that.\"\n\"What are you doing? What were you doing with Shihu?\"\nShihu has a colleague?\nWhy didn’t he tell me?\nI can’t drop my suspicion.\nI grip the knife tightly.\nThe tip shakes as I hold it.\n\"Answer me. I’ll stab you if you’re a bad person.\"\n\"I’m not a bad person. I’ll leave Shihu here. You’ll know everything if you talk to him. Here.\"\nThe white-haired woman carefully lays the unconscious Shihu on the ground.\nWhat’s with that guilty look on her face?\nThat’s the same look people who’ve done wrong give.\n\"Shihu!\"\nI rush to Shihu right away.\nThe white-haired woman quickly disappears as if she’s running away.\nThe important thing is Shihu.\n\"Shihu.\"\nThere’s no answer.\nI help him inside the house.\n\"Are you okay? Huh? Are you okay?\"\nHe doesn’t look okay.\nHe looks worse.\nHis fever’s worse, and he’s breathing heavily.\nWhat was that woman about?\nWhy did he meet her secretly?\nAnd why was she helping him?\nHe didn’t want to be helped by me, but why her?\nWhen will he explain everything?\nPlop.\nShihu collapses onto the bed, like he’s fallen from exhaustion.\n\"What happened...?\"\nIt seems like he was pretty close with that colleague.\nShe had white hair, and she was kind of pretty.\nShe gave off a strangely noble vibe.\nI had thought about stabbing her if she was a bad person.\nBut what if she’s a good person?\nShe’s not his girlfriend, right?\nDid he secretly get a lover?\nIf he did, what can I do?\nI can only be annoyed about it.\n\"Shihu.\"\nI still hold the kitchen knife in my hand.\nFor the purpose of dealing with a bad person.\nBut who is the bad person?\nShihu is unconscious.\n\"Shihu?\"\nI whisper right next to his ear.\nYou promised to protect me.\nI don’t know what you’ve been doing outside, or who you’ve been involved with behind my back...\n\"You can’t leave me, right?\"\nThe blade of the knife glints.\nOf course, I’m not planning to stab Shihu.\n\"Hehe.\"\nThat’s how it is.\nI told you not to leave me, so I won’t be the one who gets abandoned.\nIf I act too childish, you’ll hate it.\nI need to help Shihu.\nI don’t want to be the one clinging on to him.\nGive and take.\nI need to give something back to Shihu.\n\"When you wake up, you’re going to go out again, aren’t you?\"\nThere’s no answer.\nShihu looks like he’s asleep.\n\"And you’re going to keep hiding everything from me, just telling me to wait.\"\nI think there must be a reason for everything.\nIf that reason is that he went to meet a woman, I’ll be disappointed.\nJust say you’re meeting her and go!\nIf you think I’m getting in the way, just tell me directly.\nWhat is he doing?\nI roll up Shihu’s sleeve.\nI don’t know what kind of drugs he’s been using, but the injection marks have multiplied.\nDo people usually use this many injections?\nWhy?\n\"He’s been using drugs... He’s really going to the hospital, right?\"\nThere’s no answer.\nI think I smell medicine on Shihu.\nI also feel disgusted by the smell of that unknown woman.\n\"...When you wake up, you’re going to explain everything, right?\"\nThat’s the way it should be.\n\"I’ll make breakfast for you.\"\nIt’s 3 a.m.\nI can’t sleep at all.\nThe extreme thoughts just won’t leave my mind.\n***\nEventually, Shihu woke up.\nIt took about five hours for him to wake up.\nIt’s morning now.\n\"You’re awake?\"\nI had stayed awake the whole time.\nI put a cold cloth on his forehead since his fever was rising.\n\"Huh...? Hmm?\"\nHe looks around, trying to clear his head.\n\"Home...?\"\nHe’s trying to gather his thoughts.\nI hope he wakes up fully soon.\nHe has a lot to explain to me.\n\"You don’t remember?\"\n\"Ah... I came home.\"\nWhat on earth was he doing that he doesn’t remember?\nThis is suspicious.\nBut he should remember being with the woman.\n\"You were collapsed in front of the house.\"\nThe woman left you behind.\n\"I see. Sorry, it must’ve been tough carrying me.\"\n\"What did you do yesterday?\"\n\"......\"\nHe doesn’t answer again.\n\"Do you do things on your own? Or are there others involved?\"\n\"You don’t need to worry about it.\"\n\"That’s not okay.\"\n\"Sorry, I’ll explain later. Really...\"\nIt’s the same conversation again.\nNo progress.\nShihu isn’t saying anything.\n\"Oh, it’s 8 o’clock... I have to go again. Sorry.\"\n\"Wait, eat something first. I made a quick meal.\"\n\"Uh...\"\nThere were no ingredients, and I’m not a great cook, so it’s nothing special.\nI just mixed rice with tuna and soy sauce.\nI boiled some ramen to eat with it, and it’s okay enough.\nShihu sits at the table, probably unable to refuse eating.\nHe takes a bite of the food.\n\"It’s good.\"\n\"Right?\"\nHe takes a few more bites, but then, like he’s about to give up, he says:\n\"Yeah, I’d like more, but... I’m sorry, I really need to go quickly.\"\n\"Doesn’t it taste bad?\"\n\"No, I’m just busy.\"\nIs that all?\nWhat’s he so busy with?\n\"You’ll come back early today, right? Let’s hang out.\"\nI feel like I’ll forget how to have fun.\n\"I’ll try my best. Once this is over, everything will be fine.\"\nI don’t know what he means by \"everything will be fine.\"\nI don’t feel fine at all.\nIs he going to suddenly not come back?\nIs he going to say he’s tired of me and cut off contact?\n\"So... is the house clean? Did you tidy up? Good job, right?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Am I being helpful to you?\"\nI ask directly.\n\"You don’t really need to do anything. You’re already enough help.\"\nHe says that while meeting with other women.\nWithout telling me anything.\nI’m just someone who can’t be trusted to work with him.\nI’m not trusted.\nAm I less trusted than that white-haired woman?\nI’m really hurt by this.\nI don’t think this is right.\n\"You’re not lying, right?\"\nI ask hesitantly, holding my hands behind my back.\n\"No.\"\n\"I’m the most helpful to you, right?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"I’m your best friend, right? You only hang out with me, right?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"If you had to choose between me and someone else, you’d pick me, right?\"\n\"Of course, it’s you.\"\nWell then, I can relax.\nI’m glad.\n\"If you’re lying...\"\n\"I’m not lying.\"\n\"...Okay!\"\nI let go of my worries.\nI can let him go now.\nFor now.\nShihu leaves the house.\nI release the hands I had been holding behind my back.\nI put the kitchen knife, which I had been hiding, down.",

I’m scared.\"\n\"Ugh...\"\nShihu hesitates.\n\"...It’s a drug that erases memories.\"\n\"What? Memory?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nIs he really going to use that on me now?\nWhy?\nIs telling me this part of the reason?\nIf I forget, I won’t even remember that I was injected with something that erases my memory?\n\"...Why? Why memory?\"\nWhy erase memories?\nWait, does that mean all the weirdness in my memory is because of this drug?\nMy earlier guess about amnesia turns out to be right.\n\"What happened? How many times have you used this on me?\"\nI’m scared.\nWhat really happened?\n\"S-So, are you doing this because I saw that white-haired woman? You’re trying to make me forget?\"\nI’m horrified.\nThis isn’t like him.\nThe memories that have been erased must have been important.\nThis isn’t the Shihu I know.\n\"Did I bother you with questions? Was it because I didn’t listen?\"\nIf this is really erasing memories, that’s a pretty convenient way to handle things.\n\"...I’m sorry.\"\n\"You... you... this isn’t the Shihu I know...\"\nShihu wouldn’t act like this.\nSomething’s gone terribly wrong.\n\"If I just found out a little bit, it could be like this... I’m sorry. Just hold on until everything is resolved.

      "content": "Hansihoo once played with a balloon.\nIt’s fun when you throw it filled with water.\nAnd inevitably, there’s one thing you have to try.\nHow much water can you put into the balloon before it bursts?\nWhat’s the tipping point where it can just barely hold on?\nYou fill the balloon.\nAttach it to the faucet, secure it so it doesn’t fall off, and wait.\nIt swells and swells until, finally, pop.\nLaughing, you finish the game.\nThe problem is, Seo Ah is in a situation similar to that balloon.\nShe hasn’t burst yet, and she’s surprisingly flexible... but she’s like a balloon on the verge of popping.\nFor the balloon, the water is like mana to Seo Ah.\nIf even a little more mana is added, she’ll explode.\nThe balloon, which should have burst by now, is being held together by tape. It’s hard to tell now if it’s still a balloon or just a pile of tape.\nThere’s really no solution.\nHansihoo has two plans in mind.\nOne is to find a way to treat Seo Ah.\nThat plan is ongoing.\n\"...I have to do something.\"\nHansihoo has tried to find a cure, even injecting himself with drugs in the process, but he feels himself gradually becoming addicted.\nThe drug, combined with the purification penalty, gnaws at his mind.\nOf course, the power of the drug helped him clear out the villains faster.\nHe crushed the opposing organizations, took control of the drug-making factories, and killed any enemies that appeared.\nHe even obtained proof that the doctor is still alive.\nBut the treatment method remains unknown.\nEven with the Saintess, they’ve tried several treatment methods, but none of them worked.\nHansihoo has started to feel something like a dragon-like power stirring within himself.\nIt seems like there’s no answer.\nUnless he can go back to the past, it feels like there’s no way to solve this.\nAnd so, there’s really only one last resort.\nIf he can’t create a happy ending through normal methods, Hansihoo is thinking about going back to the past.\nNot just restoring his memories, but literally changing the past.\nIn other words, Hansihoo has the power of a protagonist.\nA protagonist has the power to make their wishes come true.\nHe wanted to be good at swordsmanship, so he gained sword skills.\nHe wanted to handle magic, so he gained magical skills.\nHe wanted to run fast, so he developed a dash skill.\nHe wanted to erase bad things, so he gained a purification skill, and to light up everything with light, he acquired light-based skills.\nRecently, he gained drug resistance skills because he wanted to overcome the drugs.\nAnd one of the things Hansihoo most desired...\nTo return to the past.\nA powerful desire to live like before gave birth to a new skill.\n[Retry]\nA retry.\nThe description of the skill is as follows:\n[This can be used when you have given up everything. You will return to the past to fulfill your wish.]\nThe phrase \"giving up everything\" is very meaningful.\nIt’s a skill Hansihoo would find hard to use, even if he wanted to.\nBecause he has never really given up everything.\nHe suspects that it would only activate if he tried to commit suicide.\nThere are things like this in games.\nYou put a coin in and revive your character.\nThis probably feels like that kind of retry.\nSo, if there’s truly no other way, Hansihoo has no choice but to place his fate in this skill.\n\"...No, this isn’t right.\"\nHe says, looking into the mirror.\nHansihoo now understands why Seo Ah muttered to herself in front of the mirror.\n\"This isn’t right.\"\n[Retry]\nA strange sense of reassurance, as if there’s one more chance.\nA temptation to live comfortably.\nEven if Seo Ah breaks down, he can just go back to the past and fix it.\nIf an unmanageable problem arises, he can just go back and erase it.\nThese thoughts spring up everywhere.\n\"Try harder.\"\nWas Seo Ah feeling the same way?\nEven with the skill, it’s hard to endure.\nHe sees himself being consumed by the drug, even as he uses it.\nSeo Ah must have suffered a lot.\nHansihoo feels crushed by guilt.\nAfter personally feeling the effects of the drug, he realizes just how much Seo Ah has endured.\nHe used to think only the weak succumbed to the drugs. But now he concludes that all humans are weak.\n\"Shihu, what are you doing?\"\n\"...I was just... looking in the mirror.\"\n\"Are you going out again today?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nHe nods and prepares to leave.\nToday, he plans to raid what he suspects is the doctor's base.\n\"...Why are you leaving?\"\nSeo Ah always asks like this.\nSometimes he says he can’t tell her, or just makes up some excuse.\nIt’s become part of their daily routine.\n\"Hey, Seo Ah?\"\nBut today, something’s different.\nSeo Ah is holding the kitchen knife.\nIt doesn’t seem like she’s trying to attack, but it’s an unusual behavior.\n\"You know... I’m just worried about you, Shihu...\"\n\"Why the kitchen knife?\"\n\"You’re not hanging out with bad people, are you?\"\n\"No, I’m not.\"\nThe kitchen knife makes her seem scary.\nOf course, Hansihoo could overpower her easily, but there’s a different kind of fear.\n\"Ah... Hmm... Is there anything I can help with? Hmm?\"\nAs Seo Ah speaks while holding the kitchen knife, Hansihoo can’t relax.\nSeo Ah’s expression is kind, but it feels like the knife she’s holding could be used as a weapon.\n\"It’s fine.\"\nNo need to help.\nReally, it’s fine.\n\"...Are you sure there’s nothing you need help with? Hmm? Aren’t you doing something dangerous outside?\"\n\"Don’t worry about it.\"\nThat’s a lie.\nIf Hansihoo were to list everything he’s been doing, Seo Ah would be horrified.\n\"Okay... I see.\"\nSoon, the purpose of the kitchen knife will be decided.\n\"Then, here.\"\nSeo Ah tries to hand the kitchen knife to Hansihoo.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nThey don’t understand each other.\n\"Ah, it’s sharp, so just use it like this. Look.\"\nSeo Ah naturally cuts her palm with the sharp edge of the kitchen knife.\n\"What are you doing?\"\nHansihoo snatches the knife, but it’s too late.\nBlood is already flowing from Seo Ah’s hand.\n\"You need a weapon, don’t you? You don’t seem to be carrying anything these days.\"\nIt seems like she gave him the kitchen knife thinking it was a weapon.\nHowever, it’s a misconception that Hansihoo doesn’t have a weapon.\nHe has a space pocket, or should we say an inventory, where things are carefully stored out of sight.\nOriginally, it wasn’t large enough to hold weapons, but as his skill levels rose, even weapons could be stored there.\n\"I’m fine. Look.\"\nSwoosh.\nA sword appears in his hand.\nIt’s one of the weapons he had stored.\nHe even shows her how it’s put back into the space pocket.\n\"Wow...\"\n\"I keep my weapons stored separately. For now, wash your hand quickly. I’ll disinfect and put some medicine on it.\"\nIs it normal for someone to casually cut themselves like that?\nIt was a light cut, so it’ll heal soon, but...\nWould the old Seo Ah have done this?\nNo, that’s impossible.\nHansihoo’s attempt to return Seo Ah to the state he knew is clearly impossible.\nOf course, he knows this.\nThis is just a temporary measure.\nIt’s a deception to cover the wound so Seo Ah doesn’t suffer.\nWithout fundamental treatment, it will eventually burst.\n[Retry]\nWill there ever come a time when he gives up everything?\nThis is a skill he’d tried not to think about.\nIt wasn’t even on the list of options, the second plan or anything.\nBut the more time passes, the more he finds himself drawn to it.\nBut Hansihoo won’t give up.\nHe will overcome this.\nBecause Seo Ah hasn’t given up either.\n\"Hmm? Why are you looking at me?\"\nSeo Ah makes a face as if she doesn’t understand.\nNo, maybe Seo Ah has given up.\nShe’s the one who said the memory-restoring drug was good.\nShe’s the one who mumbled that she wanted to die.\nShe’s the one who lost her sanity from drug addiction and tried to kill Hansihoo.\n\"Ah, I think I look like I’m smiling. Hehe.\"\nShe draws a picture on her skin with the blood flowing from her palm.\nIs it appropriate to call this innocent?\n- This isn’t the Seo Ah you know.\n- Just kill her.\n- She seems dead already anyway.\nThe purification penalty speaks in his mind.\nAnd now, those voices, influenced by the penalty, don’t seem so wrong, which makes things worse.\n\"Shihu?\"\nSeo Ah asks when she notices his bad expression.\nShe starts to reflect, wondering if she did something wrong.\n\"...Ah, I did something strange, didn’t I? Ah. Yeah, cutting my hand was weird. It’s just... a habit.\"\nMumbling.\n\"My mind’s been off lately, so that’s why. It’s all because of him... No, I mean... sorry...\"\nIt’s hard for Hansihoo to watch Seo Ah act like this.\nThere’s no way he could give up.\nHe can’t give up on Seo Ah.\nHansihoo hugs Seo Ah without thinking.\n\"Ah, uh, oh... oh...\"\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Seo Ah hugs him back.\n\"Sorry...\"\nHansihoo apologizes.\nHe’s lost count of how many times he’s apologized.\nIt’s hard to answer if someone asks what exactly he’s apologizing for.\nHe’s done so many things to be sorry for.\n\"Ah... yeah... Shihu, if there’s something tough, even if you don’t say it... it’s okay to just quit. I won’t say anything.\"\nIt’s okay to give up.\nShe whispers this in his ear.\n\"You said you were going out to do something... Don’t push yourself. You don’t need to hold on to something so difficult.\"\nBut Hansihoo has no intention of giving up.\nHe has to find a way out.\n\"So... yeah... would you like to stay here with me instead of going out?\"\nThat sounds nice.\nHansihoo almost answers without thinking.\nHe feels the warmth of Seo Ah in his arms and wants to say yes.\nBut, still...\nThere are things that need to be done.\nOr, perhaps he should just give up on everything and spend time with Seo Ah, using drugs together.\nSince everything seems doomed anyway, maybe they can just have fun and start over.\n\"No, I have work to do.\"\nHe shakes off the temptation.\n\"Yeah...\"\n\"I’ll be done soon, so just wait a little.\"\nHe won’t give up.\nHe can’t throw away his responsibilities just because things are hard.\nHansihoo’s only responsibility is to ensure Seo Ah’s happy ending.",

You just inject it. You can only use them two or three times before they’re disposable.\"\n\"What kind of drug is it...?\"\n\"To find a cure, I need to do my own research. Continuously.\"\nHe was speaking in riddles.\nA sense of unease rose within me.\nInstead of food, syringes were now on the table.\n\"Are you okay...? Maybe you should just get some rest...\"\nHe must’ve been exhausted after staying up all night doing whatever he’d been doing outside.\nMaybe sleep would be better.\n\"I’m fine. I’ll handle it. Don’t worry.\"\n\"O-okay.\"\nThen he began taking out syringes.\nOne, two, three, four...\nFive of them.\n\"Are you going to use all of those?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"That’s... several days’ worth, isn’t it?\"\n\"Today’s morning dose.\"\nThat seemed excessive.\nEven to someone who didn’t know much, injecting five syringes in one sitting didn’t feel normal.\n\"...Why?\"\n\"To find a cure. I’m just doing it at home instead of outside.\"\n\"I... see.\"\nWas it better than him doing things secretly outside?\nIt had to be, right?\nWatching him prepare the syringes left me feeling uneasy.\nHe jabbed the needle in, injecting the drug.\nThen Shihu staggered as he stood up.\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\"......\"\nHe didn’t answer.\n\"Shihu?\"\n\"...[Purify].\"\nShihu glanced at me with an irritated expression.\n\"S-sorry. Did I interrupt you?\"\nIt felt like I shouldn’t push him.\nHe jabbed himself again.\nNo matter how I thought about it, this didn’t seem like normal medication.\nThe needle marks on his arm must have been from this.\nBut he said “Purify” just now.\nWas it poison that needed to be purified?\nOr was there something harmful in the drug itself?\nIf so, couldn’t he purify it right away?\nWhy was he dragging it out? I didn’t understand.\nAbout five minutes later, Shihu finally spoke again.\n\"...[Purify].\"\nThen he injected himself.\nAnd again.\nAnd again.\nBy the time he used the last syringe, almost an hour had passed without him using the Purify skill.\n***\nShihu fell asleep.\nIt seemed like he used some kind of skill to force himself into slumber.\nHe barely touched the food I had prepared.\nI was worried about a lot of things, but at least he was here.\nWhatever he had failed at outside didn’t matter now—he was home, and that was enough.\nI covered him with a blanket.\nI decided to sleep beside him.\nSwallowing the pill Shihu had given me, I made a spot next to him.\nI lay down carefully, keeping a little distance so I wouldn’t wake or disturb him.\n\"Hehe...\"\nA faint warmth reached me.\nIt reminded me of old times.\nI could finally relax enough to fall asleep.\nAnd for the first time in a long while, I dreamed.\nIn the dream, everyone was happy.\nShihu was smiling.\nBeside him, a silver-haired girl sat in a chair, chatting away.\nThere was another girl with strange braided hair, and yet another with blue hair.\nShihu was popular.\nSeeing him so happy made me feel good.\nBut where was this place?\nAn academy?\nIt felt like an academy.\nThe sunlight was warm.\nDelicate flowers swayed in the breeze.\nShihu was smiling.\nSmall birds fluttered by.\nIt was spring.\nI wanted to play with Shihu, too.\nEven if it was just a dream, so what?\nI tried to take a step toward him.\nBut I couldn’t move.\n—You’re supposed to come here.\nWhere?\nI turned around to see.\nDozens of needles and blades were pointed at me.\nIt was a laboratory.\nThat monstrous space was chasing after me.\nI had hated needles since I was young.\nAn alarm blared in my head, warning me to run.\nMy breath caught in my throat.\nRun.\nBut my feet felt stuck, as if they were bound.\nIt’s fine.\nIt’s just a dream.\nIf I wait a little longer, it’ll end.\nAll I had to do was wake up.\nI tried to wait for the dream to pass.\nBut even a second felt unbearable.\nThe pain was overwhelming.\nI couldn’t breathe.\nThe needles seemed to close in, just inches from my face.\nMy breathing grew erratic, but no air came in.\nEverything was dark.\nA moment ago, everything was happy. Why had it turned into this?\nI couldn’t breathe.\nI couldn’t inhale.\n\"Khak—!\"\nI woke up.\nThe nightmare was over, but I still couldn’t breathe.\nSomeone was choking me.\n\"Kuh, urgh...\"\nThe grip wasn’t particularly strong, but it was enough.\nShihu was strangling me.\nWhy?\nHis eyes were half-closed.\nI gasped, pounding on Shihu’s arm.\nTears welled up and blurred my vision.\nThe darkness began to creep in again.\nHad I done something wrong?\nWas Shihu trying to kill me?\nI was reaching my limit.\nI thrashed, desperate not to die like this.\nShihu, Shihu, Shihu!\nPlease!\n\"...Seo Ah?\"\nThe pressure on my neck loosened.\n\"Kaah, pah, haaah, huuu, cough, cough...\"\nI gulped in air, gasping and coughing uncontrollably.\nMy head spun.\nMy body felt weak, drained of all strength.\n\"...Huh?\"\nShihu stared at his own hands, as if he didn’t understand what had just happened.\nIt didn’t seem intentional.\nThat was enough for me.\n\"I-I think, cough, it’s because I lay next to you without saying anything, c-cough...\"\nIt must’ve been a reflex.\n\"I-I choked you...?\"\n\"I’ll, cough, sleep somewhere else. Sleep well.\"\n\"Wait, Seo Ah. Are you okay?\"\n\"Yeah! I’m fine.\"\nI wasn’t hurt.\nThis was nothing.\n\"I... what did I... I’m sorry...\"\nShihu’s expression was a mix of confusion and guilt.\nHe tried to get up, still not fully awake.\n\"I’m fine! Just stay lying down.\"\n\"No, I’m sorry. I knew it was dangerous for me to stay here.\"\nShihu got up and started preparing to leave.\n\"No, no, no! Don’t go outside. Just rest here!\"\n\"You saw it. I’m not okay.\"\n\"I don’t care, I don’t care! I like being choked, okay? So don’t leave!\"\nI couldn’t let him go.\n\"...What?\"\nIf he left, it felt like he would never come back.\nI couldn’t let that happen.\n\"What are you saying...\"\nOf course I didn’t like being choked.\nBut a little suffocation was better than losing Shihu entirely.\n\"Anyway, don’t leave. I’m fine, really.\"\nForcing Shihu back under the blanket, I held him there.\n\"Let’s just stay together, okay? Please.\"\n\"Ugh...\"\nShihu shook his head as if his thoughts were giving him a headache.\n\"Come on, lie down. Rest, and you’ll feel better.\"\nWhether it was the drugs or some skill, Shihu soon fell asleep again.\nI sat at a slight distance from him.\nBeing too close wasn’t a good idea.\nI couldn’t understand it.\nWhy was I so terrified of Shihu leaving?\nThe emotions were there, but I couldn’t rationalize them.\nIt felt like I had been abandoned in the past.\nBut I had no such memories.\nThey didn’t exist.\nI had no intention of trying to recall the past.\nMemories like that would only bring back nightmares, dredged up from hell itself.\n\"Don’t go...\"\nEven so, the feeling wouldn’t go away.\nI wanted to scream at him not to leave.\nSelf-reflection. I needed to think carefully about what had just happened.\nShihu wanted to leave because he felt guilty.\nSo all I had to do was make sure he didn’t feel guilty.\nAs long as I didn’t complain, everything would be fine.\nEven if he strangled me, there was no reason for him to feel bad.\nAnd the drugs.\nIt seemed like they made him more compliant to what I said.\nSo Shihu needed to keep using them.\nI wouldn’t criticize him for it.\nWhatever the drug was, it had to be something good if it was meant to help him find a cure.\nI told myself that.\nAs long as Shihu stayed home, everything would be okay.\n\"Heh... hehe...\"\nIt was fine.\nIt really was.\nShihu was sleeping soundly.\nThere was nothing wrong.\nI couldn’t lie down and sleep beside him, but still.\nNothing was wrong.\nEverything was fine.",

      "content": "The phone rang.\nSomeone was looking for Han Shihu.\nIt was a failure.\nHe had missed the doctor, and the drugs were no closer to being a cure.\nPerhaps it was a mistake to repeatedly inject dozens of doses into himself, raising his drug resistance to absurd levels.\nEven with Shihu’s formidable mental fortitude, he had overdone it.\nThe once-urgent voice pressuring him had gone silent.\nIt didn’t matter anymore.\nIt was all a failure.\nThere was no cure—nothing.\nThe call was from Lena.\nShihu had no intention of answering.\nShe would just ask where he was.\nBetter to destroy the phone.\nThough Shihu searched for it, it was nowhere to be found.\nBecause the phone had long since been smashed and was lying in pieces on the floor.\n\"...Ah.\"\nHallucinations and auditory delusions.\nProbably from lack of proper sleep.\nEven though he used a skill to force himself to sleep, it was unstable at best.\n\"Damn it...\"\nStill, he used more drugs.\n[Drug Resistance IX]\nOne more level, and there might be something.\nThat was why he kept pumping more drugs into his body.\nIf this didn’t work, there was no other answer.\n—Restart? Restart? Restart?\n\"Shut up.\"\nShihu knew.\nThe skill descriptions never lied.\nIf a skill required him to give up everything, there had to be a problem with it.\nThe tempting escape always came with risks.\n—Restart? Restart? Restart?\nSince it was a failure, one more round?\nIt was almost mocking him.\nCould life really be treated like a game?\nShihu knew this world was no more than a grand stage.\nAfter all, everyone else was just an extra.\nHe was the protagonist.\nSo, it didn’t matter what he did.\nBut just because he could do anything didn’t mean he could achieve everything.\nHe couldn’t save Seo Ah.\nHe might have been able to save her—if it was the Seo Ah from the past.\nIf he hadn’t used the drugs to such an extent that he was now a wreck.\nIf he hadn’t gone this far, maybe he could have saved her.\n—Restart? Restart? Restart?\nThe time to use more drugs had come.\nWas this what Seo Ah had felt?\nShihu glanced around.\nHe checked where he had left the drugs.\nToday’s doses were stored in a drawer.\n\"Drugs...\"\nHad he run out?\nNo, that couldn’t be.\n\"...They’re gone.\"\nHe knew the truth.\nWhy the drugs weren’t in the drawer.\nHe had seen Seo Ah opening and closing the drawer.\nIt had to be her.\nRising to his feet, Shihu decided to confront her.\nHe could always get more drugs, even if some were missing.\nBut he wanted to ask Seo Ah why she had taken them.\n\"Seo Ah?\"\nMaybe she had done it out of concern.\nEven Shihu knew he was taking far too many.\nHe could understand that.\nHe would just have to convince her not to do it again.\nHe had no intention of blaming her.\n\"Seo Ah? Are you in your room?\"\nWhat was she doing in there?\n\"I’m coming in, okay?\"\nThe door creaked open.\nSyringes came into view.\nIt was true—Seo Ah had taken the drugs.\n\"Ah, Shihu, I—uh...\"\nUsed syringes rolled across the floor.\nShihu hadn’t considered the possibility that Seo Ah might use them herself.\nHe had been giving her pills, believing they were enough to suppress her urges.\n\"I accidentally... used it.\"\nHer palm bore marks from needle pricks.\nIt seemed she had jabbed herself by mistake while moving the syringes.\n\"Ha... haha. Why did you... use this stuff alone...?\"\nA single syringe might have been an accident, but all five syringes were empty.\nSeo Ah was already drenched in euphoria.\n—You can’t stop her. Just give up.\n—Might as well let her indulge until the end.\nHe couldn’t blame Seo Ah.\nShihu knew all too well what it was like.\nOnce addiction set in, there was no escape.\n\"Give me more of that drug.\"\n—She’s not the Seo Ah you knew.\nNo, this was the Seo Ah he knew.\nShihu muttered to himself.\n\"...Why did you take them?\"\n\"Because... you were using so much. Ahaha. But... I guess it wasn’t that much, huh? Hehe.\"\n\"...Using any more would probably kill you.\"\nIt was strange.\nSeo Ah hadn’t died.\nHer resistance might even be stronger than Shihu’s, who had a Drug Resistance skill.\nIt was as if she were born to use these substances.\nPerhaps that was true.\nAfter all, Yu Seo Ah’s original role had been nothing more than that—to use drugs.\n\"I don’t know. Let’s use more!\"\nHe had no grounds to tell her not to.\nShihu was doing the same, after all.\nHe no longer knew what the right course of action was.\nShihu handed her two or three syringes he had on hand.\nSeo Ah took them with a beaming smile.\n\"Are there more?\"\nOf course. There were plenty.\nThere was no reason to withhold them now.\n\"Wow...\"\nShihu emptied his inventory of drugs onto the table.\nHe had never seen Seo Ah look so happy.\nHe returned to the dining table and sat down.\nWhy had his life turned out like this?\nIt had been wrong from the very beginning.\nHe had lost his parents in an accident.\nIf that accident hadn’t happened, Shihu and Seo Ah might have lived normal, happy lives.\nIf monsters hadn’t appeared, and if Awakened individuals hadn’t fought battles in this bizarre world.\nHis parents were gone. He had no other family.\nHis childhood friend was in the next room, laughing while using drugs.\nShihu himself wasn’t much better.\n—Restart? Restart? Restart?\n\"...I want to die.\"\nHe finally let the thought cross his mind.\nHe wanted to make everything irrelevant, to erase it all.\nShihu had reached his limit.\nEven limits could only be pushed so far. Now it felt like the entire world was crushing him.\nIn a way, it was remarkable.\nThat he was only now seriously contemplating death.\nSome people use drugs before they die, hoping to go out in a final burst of pleasure.\nShihu had already indulged as much as he could.\nWas it time to go?\nHe staggered to his feet.\nWhat should he do?\n—Restart? Restart? Restart?\nThe combination of drug effects and purification penalties was horrific.\nIt felt like his entire body was being eaten away by insects.\nHe wasn’t sure what was worse—his physical state or his lack of sleep.\nOr maybe he was coming down with something.\nShihu slowly walked out the door.\nSeo Ah wouldn’t notice.\nNot anymore.\nIt didn’t matter who left the house.\n***\n\"...Ugh.\"\nThe drugs were gone.\n\"Shihu, I need more...\"\nHow much time had passed?\nIt was nighttime, a time to sleep.\n\"Ah...\"\nShihu was nowhere to be seen.\nHe had been gone for quite a while.\nI thought we were using the drugs together.\nBut now that I think about it, there had been no one else in the room but me.\n\"...Ah...\"\nIt dawned on me too late that something was wrong.\nWhy would Shihu give me so many drugs?\nBecause he liked me?\n\"...Shihu?\"\nThat must be it, right?\nTo make me happy.\nCrash.\nI couldn’t get up and collapsed onto the floor.\nSomething felt wrong.\nAs the euphoria faded, pain began to seep in.\nBut that wasn’t what mattered.\nI stumbled into the living room to check if Shihu was there.\nHis shoes were missing from the entrance.\n\"...He left?\"\nEven if I went outside into the dark, I doubted I’d find him.\nHe would come back if I waited.\nI decided to stay inside and wait.\nI sat in the chair Shihu usually occupied.\nAnd then I started thinking about where he might have gone.\nHe wouldn’t have abandoned me, right?\nThinking like this felt like a sickness.\nI should just wait calmly.\nShihu liked me.\nHe definitely did.\nAfter all, he gave me so many drugs before he left.\nEven if I’d used them all.\nHe must’ve gone to get more.\nThat had to be it.\nSitting here brought back memories of when I was young.\nReally young.\nBack when I still had parents.\nShihu thought I lost them in an accident.\nIn a monster attack.\nThat was partially true.\nOnly halfway.\n—\"Seo Ah, here.\"\nHe had said that, handing me a piece of candy.\nIt was at the playground.\nI hadn’t been able to go outside for a while, but that day, I was finally out with my mom, and I was happy.\nWe ate snacks and the lunch my mom had packed.\nThinking about it now, she really was a good mom.\nAnd that was the last memory I had of her.\nI never saw her again.\nI didn’t know what happened.\nWas it a monster attack?\nNo, I know now.\nShe abandoned me.\nSeo Ah must have been too much trouble, too bothersome.\nIt was a memory I had tried to forget, but now it had come back.\nWhy now, of all times?\n\"...No.\"\nThere was a common thread.\nMy mom gave me delicious food and spent the whole day playing with me at the playground. It made me happy.\nShihu gave me drugs, so many drugs, and that made me happy too.\nThe point is, they gave me things they didn’t usually give.\nAnd then my mom abandoned me.\nSo would Shihu abandon me too?\nWhy did this feel so familiar?\nThis crushing despair—it felt horribly familiar.\n\"Ah... haha... hahaha. No way. No way.\"\nThat couldn’t be true.\nShihu said he wouldn’t abandon me.\nHe said everything he did was for me.\nMaybe he just went out for a walk.\nYeah, I should go outside.\nEvery time I left the house, Shihu somehow knew and would come running.\nLike he had installed a surveillance system or something.\nThe doorknob clicked as it turned, and the door opened.\n\"Shihu.\"\nOne step outside.\nThen a few more.\nUsually, by now, Shihu would be running toward me, telling me not to go outside.\n\"Shihu? Where are you?\"\nBut there was nothing.\nNo one was there.\nI thought about searching further, but I didn’t know the area well.\nIt was ridiculous, really.\nThis was my house, but I had no idea what was around it.\nIf I left and Shihu came back while I was gone, that would be a problem.\nSo I decided to stay near the house.\nHe’d come back soon, right?\nHe would.",

      "content": "I kept waiting.\nWaiting for Shihu.\nUntil, suddenly, it hit me—he wasn’t coming back.\nIt dawned on me, perhaps because I had used so many drugs at once.\nEven the distant past began to resurface.\nEver since I remembered that my mother had abandoned me, things had felt strange.\nMemories I had buried deep within were clawing their way back up, one by one.\nIt started when I was staring at the empty syringes.\nA powerful sense of déjà vu struck, making me realize I had forgotten something important.\nDrugs.\nThe doctor.\n\"This is... bad.\"\nThat was the conclusion I reached.\nI had been waiting for Shihu for twelve hours now.\nTwelve hours might already be too late.\n\"I need to stop him.\"\nI remembered who the doctor was.\nAnd why Shihu couldn’t beat them in a fight.\nCold sweat poured down my face.\nI wasn’t sure if it was the drugs or the sense that something had gone terribly wrong.\nShihu had left Yu Seo Ah behind and gone somewhere again?\nAt this point, a decision like that could only lead to one thing.\nA direct path to the bad ending.\n\"Where is Shihu?\"\nI didn’t know.\nYu Seo Ah wasn’t competent enough to know that.\nI had always wanted to be the protagonist, but in the end, I was nothing more than a fool.\nSomeone who got swept up in events without ever taking charge.\nBut this time, I had to do something.\nThink.\nWhere would a despairing Han Shihu go, and what would he be doing?\n\"Home?\"\nThis wasn’t home.\nSo I needed to find it.\nHow?\nThunk.\nI stabbed a syringe into my arm.\nNothing entered—it was empty.\nIt was just a way to injure myself and try to jog my memory.\nFor some reason, doing this helped bring memories back.\nThunk.\nIt was self-harm, pure and simple, but the sensation was familiar.\nI needed to remember.\nThere was something else I had forgotten.\nThunk.\nI remembered.\nThere was something Yu Seo Ah could do.\nSomething involving black magic.\nThunk.\nRight, I had created a weapon before, hadn’t I?\nI needed to recall what I had done with it.\nI had attacked.\nShihu, or someone else.\nSo why couldn’t I use that ability now?\nThunk, thunk, thunk...\nBlood poured from the wounds.\nSo what?\nRemembering was what mattered.\nIn the past, these injuries would have healed in no time.\nBut now, it felt like something was blocking me.\nLike a leash around my neck.\n\"A necklace.\"\nThe necklace I was wearing.\nThe one Shihu had insisted I keep on at all times.\nIt was an artifact meant to control Yu Seo Ah.\nSo I had to take it off.\nA necklace like this...\nThough, since Shihu had given it to me, I wouldn’t throw it away.\nI’d just set it aside.\nClink.\nThe necklace fell.\nA strange feeling washed over me.\nThe world looked... different.\n[...]\nI began to see something.\nSomething very familiar.\n[201 hours, 3 minutes]\nTime.\nI could see time itself.\nAnd I began to consume the magic around me.\nInstinctively, I started devouring everything nearby.\nThis... was the dragon.\n[1,009 hours, 18 minutes]\nMore.\nMore.\nI was turning into a monster.\n[9,981 hours, 20 minutes]\nEven more.\nSurpassing ten thousand hours.\nAnd then I ran.\nI had to find Shihu.\n***\nA radius of 10 kilometers experienced a loss of magical energy.\nA dragon had appeared.\nFortunately, it happened in a sparsely populated area, so the damage was minimal.\nIt couldn’t be identified by satellites.\nIt wasn’t captured on surveillance cameras.\nEven to the naked eye, there was nothing visible.\n“Quite a big one, considering the monsters have been disappearing lately,” muttered Cheon Yuseong.\nStanding next to him was the one called the Doctor.\nDespite Han Shihu’s interference, the Doctor had easily thwarted him.\nThe plan was a success.\nThe project to permanently eradicate magic from Earth was proceeding smoothly.\nThe purification device was wiping out all magical energy in the city.\nAs a result, the Awakened were losing their footing.\nMonsters no longer appeared even on the outskirts of the city.\nAlthough some still ventured into the countryside to hunt, the frequency of monster encounters had drastically declined.\n“This might be the last dragon,” said the Doctor.\n“You probably know this, but the first monster to appear was also a dragon.”\nThe first monster outbreak, which had displaced countless people.\nBefore the first Awakened managed to stop it, there had been enormous loss of life.\n“Once we take it down, it’ll be over.”\nThe dragon’s magical signature was the only one detected.\nIt was moving in a straight line toward the city center.\n“This might be the Awakened’s last job. You should call your sister,” Cheon Yuseong remarked.\n“Haha...”\nThe academy was already in the process of shutting down.\nThere was no longer any reason to train or accommodate the Awakened.\nAs long as the Doctor’s purification devices functioned, neither monsters nor the Awakened would retain their power.\nCheon Yuseong was increasingly convinced he had made the right choice by cooperating with the Doctor.\nThe Doctor had already gained immense power.\nSometimes, Yuseong wondered if this person could even be called human anymore.\n“But won’t the dragon lose its power once it enters the purification field?”\n“Until the magic stored within its body is completely depleted... who can say?”\nIf left unchecked, the dragon would cross the city’s borders.\nThey intended to let it.\nOnce it entered the purification field, it would lose its power.\nWith the surrounding magical energy gone, the dragon wouldn’t be able to maintain its invisibility.\nIts overwhelming abilities would be stripped away one by one.\nThey might not even need the Awakened to deal with it.\nUnder normal circumstances, the appearance of a dragon of this scale would have been a catastrophic emergency.\nBut now, it could be handled as if it were nothing.\n“It’s here.”\nThe dragon, which had been moving at high speed, began to slow.\nIts purpose in approaching the city remained unclear, but its limits were evident.\nIf its initial magical response had been rated at a level of 10, it was now at 7.\nThe Doctor made no move to intervene.\nThe dragon’s form was still undetectable.\n6, 5, 4, 3...\nIts speed decreased proportionally with its diminishing magical presence.\n2, 1, 0.5...\nWhen it reached the city’s outskirts, the dragon’s presence vanished entirely.\nIt was no longer a dragon.\n“This is... impressive.”\nIf this were a game, it would have been a boss monster.\nA foe requiring the cooperation of several top-tier Awakened to defeat.\nBut now, it had disappeared as if it were nothing.\nBy this point, Cheon Yuseong couldn’t understand why Han Shihu opposed the Doctor.\nWasn’t world peace the goal of a self-proclaimed hero like Shihu?\nWhat was the problem?\nThere didn’t seem to be one.\n“To think a world where monsters are no longer a threat could actually come to pass...”\nRelying on the erratic power of the Awakened to transform the world had always been foolish.\nThe return to a world governed by predictable laws, instead of unpredictable powers, was inevitable.\nEven if some were saddened or resisted, it didn’t matter.\nSince the advent of the Awakened, the world had regressed rather than progressed.\nAll the Doctor was doing was restoring the natural order.\nThe idea of labeling the Doctor as an agent of evil seemed absurd.\nThe Doctor was, quite literally, healing the world.\n***\nI ran.\nToward the place where the house I once lived in was.\nDid dragons have a homing instinct?\nI was running to the place where Shihu had to be.\nI might have flown for part of the journey.\nI had obtained incredible power, the kind worthy of a protagonist.\nAnd yet, all I could do with it was run to find Shihu.\nI didn’t even know who the real enemy was or who I was supposed to hunt.\nBut maybe, just once, if I was given the chance, it would be okay to save just one person.\nI could feel the dragon trying to consume my mind.\nBut I regained control.\n[6,054 hours 30 minutes]\nAs I approached the city, an incredible amount of time began to drain away.\n[5,539 hours 4 minutes]\nThis timer might not have been measuring the drug's effectiveness.\nIt was probably just a gauge for the remaining magic in my body.\nRegardless, I kept running.\n[4,771 hours 42 minutes]\nThe rapid loss of time was inevitable.\nI kept running.\nI had to go home.\nI had to find where home was.\nI had to stop Shihu.\nI knew what he was trying to do.\nI just hoped it wasn’t too late.\nA crucial memory had surfaced.\nThe final chapter of the novel came to mind.\nI remembered the conversation between Han Shihu and the Doctor.\nIt was after Shihu had subdued the Doctor, who was armed with highly advanced technology.\nI remembered Shihu using his purification skill on the Doctor.\nI knew why Shihu had that purification skill.\nIt was for the story.\nI could picture the way Shihu pitied the Doctor, even in that moment.\nI ran and ran.\n[800 hours]\nThere wasn’t much time left.\nThat number, which once represented an abundance of time, now felt so small.\nMy speed began to falter.\nI could feel the dragon’s abilities fading.\nI had reached my destination.\nThe outskirts of the city, a sprawling slum.\nA ruined part of town.\nFinally, familiar streets came into view.\nStreets that grew more decrepit the farther I went.\n[788 hours]\nBy not using my powers, the timer drained more slowly.\nI found where Shihu was.\nIt was the playground near his old house.\nI saw him sitting quietly on a swing.\nThis playground held so many memories.\nI never imagined we would meet here again like this.\n\"...Another hallucination?\"\nIt wasn’t the kind of thing Shihu would usually say.\nBut the way he glanced at me as he spoke said otherwise.\nOf course, it didn’t make sense for me to be here.\nHow could Yu Seo Ah possibly find Han Shihu and return to this place?\nBut somehow, I had done it.\nI found him.\nI wasn’t too late.\nThis was my way of repaying Shihu for always coming to find me.\nThis time, it was Seo Ah who had found Shihu.\nI walked over to the swing and sat on the empty one next to him.\nI was exhausted.\nI looked down at my shoes—they were completely torn apart.\nOf course, they were, after running here at that speed.\nBut Shihu was here, beside me.\nJust like the old days, when we would swing together.\n[770 hours 7 minutes]\nHow much longer could we stay like this?\nIt was time to say what needed to be said.",

      "content": "\"Shihu.\"\nHan Shihu knew that the person sitting next to him on the swing wasn’t Seo Ah.\nBut he still wanted to speak.\nTo figure out what he was supposed to do next.\n[Retry]\nWas that the skill’s name all along?\nShihu wondered briefly, but the thought passed as quickly as it came.\nIt meant he could start over.\nHe could give up everything.\nThinking about everything he had done so far made his head hurt.\nThe option to give up seemed so tempting.\nAnd yet, it was hard to make that choice.\nHe was certain there would be consequences, responsibilities he could no longer avoid.\nHe gripped his sword.\nThere were other weapons in his inventory, but his magic reserves were so low that even using a simple skill like inventory access was difficult.\nHe prepared to strike.\nPrepared to end it himself.\n\"Ah, no. Don’t do it.\"\nOf course, Seo Ah would say something like that.\nBut what did it matter?\nHe would restart anyway.\nEverything would be new.\n\"...I’m going to start over.\"\n\"No, that’s not it.\"\nSeo Ah got off the swing and grabbed his arm, pulling it back.\n\"I’m sorry. Next time, I’ll do better.\"\n\"There is no next time. Don’t run away.\"\nShe used to tell him to give up if he wanted to.\nNow her words were different.\nBut it was just a hallucination.\n\"I’m sorry.\"\n\"No, don’t go. I’m sorry. If you disappear, I’ll be left all alone. No, that’s not the issue. The Doctor, the Doctor...\"\n\"The Doctor?\"\nDid he have to hear about the Doctor here, too?\n\"The Doctor... is going to ■...\"\n\"...What?\"\n\"It’s about ■■■... and moving to another ■■ instead of reversing ■■.\"\n\"What are you talking about?\"\nThe words didn’t make sense.\nIt was as if they were filtered, distorted in some inexplicable way.\n\"Don’t you get it? ■ goes ■■ and turns into ■■.\"\n\"...I can’t hear you.\"\n\"That’s... because there’s no time... You need to...\"\nSeo Ah wavered, as though she were dizzy, struggling to steady herself.\nShihu reached out, keeping her from falling.\nHe wasn’t even sure if she was a hallucination anymore.\nAnd if she wasn’t, that was an entirely different problem.\n\"If ■ moves from here to ■■, it will ■■■ and ■■... So don’t go. If you go, I won’t meet ■■, and ■■ won’t use ■■.\"\n\"I don’t understand what you’re saying.\"\n\"......\"\nSeo Ah’s expression darkened.\n\"■■■■■■■■■■■?\"\nNow he couldn’t hear her at all.\n\"Can’t you hear me?\"\n\"No...\"\nThe resignation in her face was heartbreaking.\nHe wanted to comfort her, even if she was just an illusion.\nThere was a way.\nA way to keep Seo Ah from making that expression.\nHe could [Retry].\nHe could set everything back to the way it was.\n\"...I get it. It’s impossible, isn’t it? The story can’t be changed.\"\nSeo Ah muttered to herself.\n\"450 hours... 440... What does time even mean...\"\nStill incomprehensible.\nShihu couldn’t make sense of what was happening in front of him.\n\"Oh.\"\nSeo Ah smiled as she spoke.\n\"Hey, how about we swing together?\"\nShe pushed the swing Shihu was sitting on.\nThe rusty chains squeaked, the sound echoing in the quiet.\nThe sword in Shihu’s hand dragged along the ground.\n\"Haha... It’s fun, right?\"\nShihu couldn’t bring himself to answer.\n\"It’s getting late.\"\n\"I’ll head back inside first.\"\n\"Hey, when you’ve made up your mind, come join me, okay?\"\nHe wouldn’t make up his mind.\nInstead, he would clear everything.\nSo he would [Retry].\nReset everything.\nAt some point, the only [Skill] Shihu had left was this one.\nSo there was only one choice left.\nJust one.\n***\nI walked into the house.\nThis would be Shihu’s last memory of me.\nAnd the last memory I’d have of Shihu.\nThe original story?\nIt wasn’t much.\nTurns out, the Doctor was actually Han Shihu from another future.\nA Shihu who had come back to the past to cover up his mistakes.\nAfter defeating the Doctor, Shihu used the Purification skill on him.\nThe Doctor, regaining his clarity for a brief moment, explained his backstory.\nHan Shihu had gone too far back in time.\nToo far—back to when Seo Ah had just been born.\nThe Seo Ah he wanted to save didn’t even exist in that timeline.\nBecause of the excessive drugs, Shihu began losing his memories of Seo Ah, and even of himself.\nAll that remained was a compulsive obsession to cure the Awakened and reverse everything.\nAnd slowly, he turned into a monster.\nIt was the kind of tragic backstory you’d expect from a villain.\nBut the Shihu here wasn’t just part of the story anymore—he was becoming that villain.\n[111 hours 11 minutes]\n\"Heh.\"\nI couldn’t stop him.\nI wanted to write a message on the ground, something for Shihu to see, but my body wouldn’t move.\nSomething was restraining me.\nA force compelling Shihu to become the Doctor.\nSaving Seo Ah? That was never an option.\nThere was never a way to save either of us.\n\"...Hehe.\"\n[74 hours 22 minutes]\nNo, I was still alive.\nMaybe Shihu hadn’t given up everything yet.\nHe wouldn’t do something like that, right?\nI didn’t want to see him do it.\nI ran back to the house, hoping my last memory of him would at least be a good one.\n\"I hate this.\"\nI hate this so much.\nDon’t take away the last bit of hope I have left.\nPlease.\nNo.\nNo.\n[46 hours 15 minutes]\nShihu wouldn’t die.\nHe wouldn’t give up everything.\nIf he did, maybe I should just go back to the lab myself.\nMaybe that would be better.\nMaybe I should run outside now, stop him from leaving.\nHe’s not already dead, is he?\nBut I couldn’t summon the courage to move.\nIf I waited, Shihu would come back, right?\nBack into the house.\nHe was just at the playground. He’d come back.\nThis wasn’t some fake house—it was his real home this time.\n\"No. No. I’m scared.\"\n[30 hours 7 minutes]\nWhat was I afraid of? The time running out?\nOr the fact that Shihu wasn’t here?\nMaybe both.\nI want to go back, too.\nI want just one more chance.\nPlease.\n\"I’m sorry... Please... Save me... Help me... I was wrong... I’m begging you... I was wrong... Please forgive me... Just this once, help me... Please save me... I’m sorry...\"\nI didn’t even know who I was pleading to.\nI just crouched in a corner, apologizing to the air.\nMy lips felt parched, burning.\n[8 hours]\nThat should’ve been a lot of time.\nShould’ve been.\n[30 minutes]\nThere was no time left now.\nI braced myself for the pain.\nI squeezed my eyes shut.\nI’d wait.\nEven if it hurt, I’d endure. If I waited, maybe something would change.\n[10 seconds]\nThe timer plummeted.\nBrace for impact.\nIt would hit zero soon.\n[0]\nAnd then it went negative.\nIt should’ve hurt.\nIt should’ve been excruciating.\nI waited for the pain to come.\nBut I felt nothing.\n\"...Huh.\"\nIt didn’t hurt.\nWhy?\nI could stand, walk around.\nEven think clearly.\nI was... fine.\nI thought of the necklace Shihu gave me.\nIt seemed to suppress magic.\nWithout magic, there was no pain. I could survive.\n\"...What?\"\nThis was the Doctor’s doing.\nErasing all magic in the area.\nSo, in the end, it wasn’t much different from the necklace that suppressed my magic.\nOh.\nSo, just like this, I could live...\n\"Wait, what about Shihu?\"\nI hadn’t stopped him.\nI hadn’t run out to him because I was afraid I’d collapse and make things worse.\nI didn’t want him to leave with a bad impression of me.\nBut I shouldn’t have run away.\nOr... had he not died?\nI was still okay, so maybe...\nThere might still be hope.\nI ran outside.\nToward the playground.\nBarefoot, my feet scraped and bled on the gravel, but I didn’t care.\nI ran.\nThe swing. He’d be on the swing, for sure.\n\"He was... there... right there...\"\nAll that was left was the sword Shihu had held.\nAnd blood, staining the swing and the blade.\nThe swing swayed gently in the wind, creaking softly.\nNo.\nThis couldn’t be.\nThis wasn’t happening.\n\"No, no, no. No, it’s not true. Shihu! Shihu?\"\nI shouted, but there was no reply.\nI called out again and again, but it was the same.\n\"Wait. No, wait. This isn’t fair. It’s too much. No. If I’d stopped him at the house, if I’d held onto him, he wouldn’t have left.\"\nHe wouldn’t have died.\nHe wouldn’t have given up everything.\nMaybe the first to give up wasn’t Shihu—it was me.\nThis was my fault.\nI was the one who told him to give up.\nThis can’t be real.\nThis is absurd.\nThis isn’t right.\nDon’t joke with me.\nI clung to the sword Shihu had left behind.\nThe hilt was still warm to the touch.\nThis isn’t how it’s supposed to be.\nIt’s supposed to be a happy ending.\n\"Ah... Ah...\"\nIt’s my fault.\nIt’s my fault.\nIt’s my fault.\nNo. It’s your fault.\nWhoever you are, it’s your fault.\nI didn’t do anything wrong.\nSo bring Shihu back.\nGoddammit.\nNo...\nThis isn’t...\nNo...\n\"...This is a hallucination, right?\"\nA dream, or something like that?\nIt’s a nightmare.\nJust another nightmare I’ve had from time to time.\nThe sword Shihu left behind—or rather, entrusted to me—remains.\nHe’ll come back for it someday, right?\nYeah.\nUntil then, I’ll keep it safe.\nI’ll go back to the house.\nIt’s cold. Shihu might already be back home.\n\"He’ll come back.\"\nSo do I just wait again?\nNo, I can’t do that.\nI’ll go to where Shihu might be.\nThe academy.\nMaybe he’ll be there.\nI’ll walk there.\nLike I did before.\nWhen I went to borrow money for drugs.\nI still haven’t paid that debt.\nIt’d be nice if someone came to collect it.\n\"Ah... Haha.\"\nIt must be this way.\nIt’s just six hours on foot, at most.\nDon’t joke with me.\nShihu couldn’t have disappeared.",

      "content": "The academy had been shut down.\nSome buildings were already being demolished.\nThere were no students or teachers to be seen.\nThey said it was because the world no longer needed the Awakened.\nPerhaps the cruelest thing in the world is loneliness.\n\"...Ugh...\"\nI don’t even remember what nonsense I muttered to myself on the way to the academy.\nI slumped against the cold wall of the abandoned grounds.\nThe ground was freezing.\nNot that it mattered.\nI wanted to use again.\nEven now.\nThe thought of it disgusted and infuriated me.\nI hated that if the drugs were in front of me, I’d take them without hesitation.\nI hated it so much.\nWhy isn’t willpower enough to stop it?\n\"Seo Ah?\"\nI looked up at the sound of my name.\nIt was someone I knew.\nRena.\nRena...\nWere we friends?\nWhat had happened between us?\nMy jumbled thoughts made it hard to figure out how to respond.\nAs I stared at her, bits and pieces came back.\nShe was one of the few people who had ever been kind to me.\n\"Rena.\"\n\"It is you, Seo Ah. Your hair’s so long now, I almost didn’t recognize you. Wait, where’s Shihu?\"\nI tried to smile.\nI probably ended up with some awkward, indecipherable expression instead.\n\"He’s... somewhere.\"\nThat was all I could say.\nHe had to be somewhere.\n\"...Somewhere?\"\n\"He’s out there.\"\n\"Are you okay?\"\nI’m fine.\nMy body, at least, is fine now.\nThat’s the real problem.\n\"What happened?\"\nQuestions like this are troublesome.\nThey’re the kind people ask when they want to help.\nBut no one who’s ever gotten involved with me has come out better for it.\n\"Wait, where are you going? Seo Ah?\"\nSo I did what I always did—I ran.\nI stood up and bolted.\nI had to admit it.\nShihu was gone.\nHe’d disappeared—maybe into the past, maybe somewhere else.\n\"...I’m sorry... I’m sorry... I’m sorry... I’m sorry... I’m sorry...\"\nI muttered as I ran through the streets.\nA few passersby looked at me strangely.\nExcept there weren’t any passersby.\nThe streets were empty.\nMaybe it wasn’t even a street.\nMaybe I hadn’t really come to the academy.\nMaybe Shihu hadn’t disappeared. Maybe I hadn’t just seen Rena—\n\"Hey, hey, stop running away!\"\nIt was Rena’s voice, calling after me.\nShe’d followed me.\nWasn’t she supposed to be a heroine or something?\n\"I’m sorry.\"\nThe protagonist is gone now.\n\"What happened?\"\n\"Nothing. He’s not here.\"\n\"Why are you running away?\"\nThud.\nI tripped over a rock and fell.\nI tried to get up and run again but failed.\nRena caught up and helped me to my feet.\nI felt a sharp pang in my side—no, it wasn’t real.\nWhy wasn’t it real?\nI wanted it to be real.\nI wanted someone to end it.\n\"Did something happen with Shihu?\"\nNo matter how I thought about it, this was cruel.\nIf the protagonist is gone, the story should end.\nThis kind of epilogue wasn’t necessary.\nThe protagonist has to be somewhere.\nI won’t take his place.\nIf this is the consequence of trying to become the protagonist, then I’ll just disappear instead.\nWhy does my mind suddenly become so clear on days like this?\nWhere are the hallucinations, the voices?\nWhy can’t I ramble like I used to?\n\"...What’s wrong?\"\n\"Ah... Ugh...\"\nEven if I didn’t want to admit it, the truth was clear.\nThis world existed only to torment me.\nIt taunted me for the moments of happiness I’d had while on the drugs.\nJust end the story already.\nGive me the credits roll.\nI want it to be over.\nThe moral of the story is:\nDon’t use drugs.\nAnyone can be forced into misery.\nIndividuals are powerless.\nWas there a lesson about not running away?\nI don’t know.\nI ran away every time.\nI just tried to run from Rena again.\nAnd failed.\nWas my evasive nature the problem?\nEven if I had faced everything head-on, would there have been a solution?\nOr was it my fault for thinking that way, for overanalyzing everything instead of confronting reality?\nOr was the problem simply that I existed at all?\n\"Are you okay?\"\nI wasn’t.\nBut somehow, I needed to be.\nI needed to overcome it.\nLike a protagonist would.\nI could do it!\n\"I killed him.\"\nI confessed.\nI killed him.\nBecause it was the truth.\n\"...What?\"\n\"I killed Shihu.\"\nI murdered the protagonist.\nAn achievement no one else could claim.\nThat made me the ultimate villain, didn’t it?\n\"...You killed... Shihu?\"\n\"Yeah. So you’ll never find him. He won’t answer, and you’ll never see him again.\"\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\"I’m a villain.\"\nThe road to hell was paved with good intentions.\nI’d never intended to become a villain.\nMaybe surviving was my mistake.\n\"Stop saying nonsense. What’s wrong with you?\"\n\"I told you, I’m a villain. Kill me. You’ve got a weapon, don’t you?\"\n\"... ...\"\n\"You tried to kill me last time, didn’t you? Like then. Come on.\"\nRena looked sad.\nWas it because Shihu was gone?\n\"...Tell me what happened, slowly. Let’s move somewhere else first.\"\n***\nWe managed to rent a fairly large space.\nRena did everything she could to calm me down.\nIt helped clear my head a little.\nWhich only made things worse.\nI wanted to use.\n\"Can you talk now?\"\nRena asked gently.\n\"Shihu died because of me.\"\n\"...Can you explain what happened?\"\nExplain.\nThe more I thought about it, the more it tore me apart.\nThe pain was unbearable.\nI tried to smile, but my lips trembled.\n\"I... I annoyed him... No, that much he could handle. But... I... made a mistake... with the drugs... I used too much...\"\n\"And then?\"\n\"He got sick of me... and killed himself.\"\n\"......\"\n\"And I still want to use. I hate it, but I can’t stop. Because it feels so good.\"\nDisgust washed over me.\nI hated myself so much I wanted to die.\n\"Ah... Please, let me go back to the past too.\"\nDid Shihu go back to the past?\nI didn’t know.\n\"Wait, hold on... I still don’t understand how Shihu could have died.\"\n\"Because when he dies, he can go to the past.\"\n\"Hah... Haha, that’s absurd. Shihu’s fine. You didn’t see him die, right?\"\nNo, I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes.\nI had seen the traces he left behind.\n\"...Yeah...\"\nCould I cling to that as my only hope?\nMaybe he hadn’t really died. Maybe he’d gone somewhere else.\nI didn’t know how to explain the bloodstained sword, though.\nBut... yes, maybe he was still alive.\n\"Don’t worry. It’ll be okay.\"\n\"You think so...?\"\nCould it really be?\nI hoped it was.\n\"Do you want to rest for a bit?\"\n\"Ah...\"\nCould I rest?\nJust for a little while?\nIt felt strange to even think about resting.\nNo, wait. I knew Shihu still existed.\nThere was the Doctor.\nIf the Doctor was Shihu, then I just needed to find him.\nRight?\nThinking about it now, the Doctor’s behavior had been strange.\nHadn’t he seemed... kind?\nLike he had a purpose, though one I couldn’t quite grasp.\nMaybe this was all the Doctor’s fault.\nI started using drugs because he gave them to me.\nWhere had this vicious cycle even started?\nShihu hated the Doctor and ended up becoming the Doctor.\nAnd Shihu hated the Doctor because the Doctor gave me drugs.\n\"I need to go to the academy.\"\n\"What?\"\nI’d just confirmed that it was shut down, but...\nThe Doctor had been one of the academy’s directors.\nIf I stormed into his office, maybe he’d show up.\nOr maybe I’d find a clue.\nI had to find the Doctor.\nI didn’t know what I’d do when I saw him, but I wanted to talk.\nWhether he was Shihu or not, he was still the cause of everything.\n\"I just remembered why I came to the academy.\"\nBecause Shihu would be there.\nThe Doctor.\nMaybe.\nI didn’t really know how Shihu had turned into the Doctor.\nI only had a vague idea of what going back to the past meant.\n\"Why?\"\n\"Shihu’s at the academy. Want to come with me?\"\n\"Oh... You mean to the dorms he stayed in? There’s nothing there. I’ve been.\"\nRena must have suffered a lot after losing contact with Shihu.\nThe other heroines probably went through the same thing.\n\"I’m going anyway.\"\n\"Well... okay, but the place is locked down. All the Awakened have scattered and lost their powers. I’m practically an ordinary person now... and look, I don’t even have a weapon. Sneaking in won’t be easy.\"\nThe Awakened seemed to have been completely disarmed.\nNo weapons, no skills.\nThe Doctor’s plan had worked flawlessly.\nSuppressing the Awakened like this couldn’t have been easy.\nI guess that’s why Shihu had tried to stop it.\nBut with Shihu gone, the plan had unfolded without a hitch.\nAt least the Doctor wasn’t aiming to destroy the world.\nThat much made sense.\nThe Doctor had to have retained some of Shihu’s principles.\nWhy else would he care so much about curing the Awakened?\nIt was probably because of me.\nThings spiraled out of control, and this was where we ended up.\nThe large-scale magic suppression that benefited me was just an extension of the same logic behind Shihu putting that necklace on me.\n\"I have to go.\"\n\"......\"\nAll the more reason to go.\nThe Doctor excelled at information warfare, so he was likely monitoring what happened at the academy.\nThat’s where I had to go.\nTo meet him.\nAnd maybe to ask for drugs—\nNo, that’s not it.\nI needed to ask him.\nIf he even knew who he was.\nHow he’d ended up this way.\nAnd maybe...\n\"Ha...\"\nI sighed.\nSuppressing magic hadn’t cured my addiction.\nAt this rate, I’d still be a burden to Shihu.\nI needed to act before my last shred of willpower disappeared.",

      "content": "To make sure the Doctor would come, what would it take?\nShould I set fire to the director’s office?\nHe’d probably show up even without something that drastic.\nI climbed over the academy’s walls and broke through the locked doors to get inside.\nLena was still much stronger than ordinary people.\nIt seemed she still had some strength left.\nOr maybe it was just that the academy’s security systems were no longer operational, making it easier to break in.\n“There’s nothing here.”\nLena spoke as we entered the room where the board of directors used to meet.\nIt was perfectly tidy.\nTidy?\nNo, it wasn’t that—it was completely empty.\n“He’ll come.”\nA few security cameras were still active.\nIf the Doctor was monitoring this place, he would surely notice.\nAll I had to do was sit and wait.\nDid the Doctor think I was dead?\nWould he know I was alive because Shihu had fought him so fervently?\nI waited in the chair for what felt like an eternity.\nWhere were the academy’s directors now?\nThe headmaster had seemed like a strong Awakened. Where had he gone?\n“Uh, Seo Ah. Why exactly—”\nThe space began to ripple.\nA portal was opening.\n“He’s here.”\nLena couldn’t understand my actions.\n“Huh? He’s here? Wait, I’ll go check outside.”\nLena stepped outside to see who might have arrived.\nI was left alone in the director’s office.\nNo, not alone.\nThe Doctor appeared, stepping through the portal.\nClang, clang, clang.\nThe walls of the office sealed shut, separating the room with barriers.\nA fireproofing mechanism, perhaps?\nLena, who had gone outside, would have a hard time getting back in now.\nThe Doctor was undoubtedly monitoring this place.\nI never doubted he’d be watching with his technology or whatever else he relied on.\n“It’s been a while, Miss Seo Ah.”\nPortals worked even without magic?\nSo even with magic gone, spatial movement was still possible.\nHad he anticipated a world like this, where Awakened abilities would be irrelevant, and relied on conventional tools instead?\n“I thought you’d be with Shihu.”\nWith Shihu… together...\nWas the Doctor also Shihu?\nHe must have been Shihu once.\n“Shihu is dead.”\n“…I see.”\n“It’s because of me. But really, it’s because of you. You’re the one who gave me the drugs.”\n“That’s true.”\nHe admitted it.\n“You came back to the past just to do this?”\n“…The past?”\n“Or do you not remember anything at all?”\nThe Doctor didn’t respond.\n“Give me some drugs.”\n“…Haha.”\n“I want to use.”\nThe Doctor pulled a syringe from his pocket and tossed it to me.\n“Wow.”\n“No one knows my past.”\n“Plenty do.”\nThere were plenty in the outside world.\nSurely there were many who had read the books.\n“Perhaps you’re seeing hallucinations?”\n“That must be it, right?”\nI jabbed the syringe into my arm.\n[5 hours, 48 minutes]\n[20 minutes]\n[0]\nThe magic vanished.\nBut the euphoria remained.\n“Surely that ■■ doesn’t become ■■, does it?”\n“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”\nAh.\nIt was impossible to explain.\nThe system didn’t allow it.\nI wasn’t permitted to speak here.\n“It’s a simple ■■, where ■■ becomes ■■ and then returns to ■■ to become ■■■…”\nThe words were filtered out.\nIt was expected.\nI’d tried explaining it to Lena before, and the same thing had happened.\nHow did I appear to those listening to me?\nHow would I look?\n“Have you completely lost your mind?”\nI probably looked insane.\nOf course I’d lost my mind. How could I not?\nStanding here, enduring all this while staying sane—that would be the real madness.\n“Yeah…”\nThis was already absurd enough.\nSo please, someone tell me to wake up from this dream and leave this place.\n“Even now, it feels like I have five or six hands, but I’m barely holding it together. And yet, you’ve done this to me, and you feel nothing?”\nI directed my question at the Doctor.\n“Didn’t I say using drugs was your choice? You’re simply facing the consequences of your own decisions, Miss Seo Ah.”\nThe Doctor didn’t seem to feel any responsibility for what had happened.\nPerhaps that was only natural.\n“You said you’d help me...”\n“You’re already cured.”\n“......”\nCured?\nHow?\nBecause I couldn’t use magic anymore?\nWas that a cure?\nThe Doctor clearly had no intention of helping me further.\n“Still, because of the bond we’ve shared...”\n“Ah…?”\n“I’ll give you a parting gift.”\nThe Doctor pulled a small vial from his pocket.\nInside, a dark liquid sloshed.\n“I guarantee it’ll feel wonderful. You’ll have a peaceful, enjoyable death.”\nA euthanasia drug.\n“Oh...”\n“You can use it right away if you’d like, but I’d appreciate it if you went somewhere far away to do so.”\nIt would be inconvenient for him to deal with my corpse, after all.\n“Ah, um… Could you at least listen to me one more time?”\n“Yes, of course. Speak freely. I’ll listen.”\nBang, bang, bang.\nLena was banging on the barrier outside.\n“Listen…?”\n“Everything that happens in this room is recorded. Feel free to talk to the air if you’d like.”\n“Ah...”\nSo he was telling me to ramble to myself while he recorded it.\nI see.\n“This was all just to give you the drugs. Yes, this will be the last time we meet. You’ve done well, Miss Seo Ah.”\nThe space rippled.\nThe portal opened.\nWhat had I expected?\nThat confessing everything to the Doctor would change something?\nThere was no way to explain, and even if I could, nothing would change.\nShihu wasn’t coming back.\nThe Doctor and Shihu were clearly different people.\nIf someone asked if I was the same person I was ten years ago, or even five, it would be hard to answer.\nClaiming the Doctor was Shihu made no sense.\nIn any case, I’d received the euthanasia drug.\nBang, bang, bang, bang.\nThe banging on the barrier grew louder.\nAnd then, crash!\nThe barrier shattered.\nDust filled the air as Lena coughed and entered the room.\n“Are you okay? The wall suddenly came down, so I—”\nLena had managed to break the wall.\nEven a diminished Awakened was still an Awakened, I guess.\n“I’m fine. Let’s go home.”\nI guess I’ll use the drug.\nAt least the Doctor was kind enough to give it to me for free.\nSee? He’s a nice guy.\n***\nLena fidgeted nervously the entire way back home before she left. She said she was worried about me. Before leaving, she handed me a childish keychain, the kind kids use. If you press it, it alerts a guardian. She said her younger siblings use it and insisted I do too.\nAnd now, I’m home.\nIf I stay home, will Shihu come back?\nI set the black vial of liquid on the desk and just stared at it.\nMaybe this is a gift from Shihu, in a way.\nWhen I think about it like that, I feel... oddly happy.\n“When will I die?”\nIt’s already far too late.\nMuch too late.\nThe house is empty.\nNo one is here but me.\nThe floors are cold, and the air feels biting.\nThe house is a mess.\nIt hasn’t been cleaned in ages.\nShihu must’ve tried to tidy up a bit, but still.\n“...Are you going to run away again?”\nI ask myself.\nBut there’s not much left to run to.\nThere’s no one left to rely on.\nNo one I can cling to.\n“...Dying is something I can always do later.”\nMaybe—just maybe—Shihu will really come back.\nThere’s no way to know for sure.\nSo don’t give up yet.\nThere’s still hope somewhere.\n“...You can’t give up.”\nEven after all of this, have I learned nothing?\nWhy did I go to the Doctor?\nWasn’t it because I was looking for an easy way out?\nDid I think I could just dump all the responsibility on him?\nThis is all your fault.\nWhich means it’s my fault.\nBecause you let your life fall to pieces.\nAnd now, there’s no one left to pity you for blaming yourself.\nYou killed everyone who might have cared.\nThe circumstances were bad.\nOf course, they were.\nBut someone out there has faced worse and still overcome it.\nSo, yes, this is my fault.\n“...Did I... really mess up that badly?”\nDid I?\nYes.\n“I’m sorry...”\nStop apologizing.\nIf you’re truly sorry, show it with your actions.\nProve that there’s something left in you worth redeeming.\nWhat actions?\nWhat am I supposed to do?\nDoing nothing is the real crime.\nEven if Shihu comes back, the person I am right now is nothing but a burden.\nSo, stop being a burden.\nStop looking for someone to fix your life.\nTake care of yourself.\nThat’s how it should’ve been from the start.\n“It’s... it’s because of the drugs...”\nEveryone knows it’s because of the drugs.\nBut do you think the drugs acted on their own?\nYou chose to take them.\nDon’t make excuses.\n“I really tried to do my best...”\nThen try harder.\nStart now.\n“It’s already... too late...”\nAnd how many times are you going to repeat that?\nYou can’t be weak anymore.\nSo get up.\nGet up.\nThe black vial is there.\nThe syringe is ready.\nMy hand, holding the bottle, trembles uncontrollably.\nIt’s a bad ending.\nThere’s no avoiding it.\nI pick up the syringe.\n...\nOr maybe I should write a note before I go.\nLeave something behind.\nEven now, I feel like I want to.\nI rummage through the house.\nThere should be paper and a pen somewhere.\nThere always is, stuffed in drawers or corners.\nFound it.\nA crumpled piece of scrap paper and a pen.\n“...Scrap paper?”\nIt looks like garbage at first glance.\nBut when I flip it over, I see doodles.\nIt’s nothing significant.\nJust something Shihu and I did together.\nA game of tic-tac-toe, it seems.\nWe kept ending in a draw, so we switched to a different game.\nThere’s an unfinished game on the page.\nIf I add one more O, I’ll win.\nSo I do.\nI won.\nHehe.\n“That was fun...”\nA tear falls onto the paper.\nAt this rate, I won’t even be able to write the note.\nPlease, just one more chance.\nIs this how Shihu felt?\nPlease, just one more chance for me, too.\nI’ll try again.\nI won’t give up this time.\nI’ll do my best.\nPlease, just one more chance.\nPlease.",

      "content": "Time passed.\nThe game was over.\nI had finished reading an entire book.\nI had watched a movie to the end.\nAnd sometimes, I would think about it—\nWhat happens to the people inside after the story ends?\nI had seen a sad movie once.\nThe protagonist died a heroic death, and the extras were left behind, waiting endlessly.\nIt left me so overwhelmed that I sat in silence for a long time, lost in the lingering emotions.\nI wondered how they kept on living after that.\nNow that I was in their position, I think I understood a little.\n\"Welcome...\"\n\"That’s right. Just greet them like that.\"\nLena had recommended the job, so I got a part-time position at a café.\n\"...I should smile brightly, right?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nI had to survive.\nI wasn’t dead, so I had to live.\nI didn’t use the drugs meant for suicide.\nThe ones I used before—I could still get them, through various means.\nThey were dangerous, yet more widely available than I had expected.\nBut I tried to use them less, and by making an effort, I actually could.\nMaybe the right way wasn’t to quit all at once but to cut back little by little.\nIt had been half a year since Shihu disappeared.\nThe world was more peaceful than I had expected.\nTo say that Awakened no longer fought would be a lie, but there were no longer the large-scale battles of the past.\nHonestly, I wanted to die every day.\nIf I went to a doctor, I’d probably be diagnosed with severe depression.\nOne day, as I curled up in my room, a thought came to me—I had to pay off my debt.\nI had to be ready to return the money I owed Shihu.\nThat thought stuck with me.\nSo I went outside again.\nThe moment I stepped out, I was hit with the realization of how utterly useless I was.\nBut at the same time, in a world where the Awakened had lost their powers, others had become just as powerless.\nMaybe this world was one I could actually live in.\nOf course, I still wanted to die.\nSo first, I cut my long hair.\nI went back to the hairstyle Shihu seemed to like.\nAnd that just made me want to die even more.\nThe black pills.\nThe ones that ended the game.\nThe logout button.\nBut maybe—just maybe—there was still hope.\nI believed Shihu would come back.\nSo I decided to become a more decent person.\nI decided to quit drugs as much as possible.\nI started making money.\nAnd then, I wanted to die again.\nShihu, when are you coming back?\nThere’s no way you will.\nWhen? You’re not coming.\nBut still, I had to live.\nThere was always that one-in-a-million chance.\nI had saved enough money to repay my debt.\nNow all that was left was for the person I owed to come back.\n\"I want to die.\"\nWhether I was at home or outside, I muttered it sometimes.\nAnd then, I would think—\nIf I were Shihu, would I come back to someone who just sat around mumbling about wanting to die?\nProbably not.\nYeah, probably not.\nThe old Seo Ah would have been happy just to have him return.\nBut I wasn’t that Seo Ah anymore.\nMaybe the real problem was that I had been longing for the past.\nI had gone back to it, in every way.\nI cleaned my home.\nMade sure it was spotless.\nWould Shihu come back now?\nAnd then, time passed again.\n\"Welcome~\"\nI had gotten pretty good at handling customers at the café.\nIt was strange.\nWhen I put in the effort, I could smile again, just like before.\nMaybe I was getting a little closer to being normal.\nI should have done this sooner.\nI tried working other part-time jobs too.\nI wasn’t in school anymore, so I had to earn money somehow.\nI heard they were planning to repurpose the academy buildings into a regular school.\nI was just glad I could do something at all.\nBut becoming a normal high school student?\nThat was impossible.\nAnd I didn’t intend to try.\n\"Take care...\"\nAs I worked, the days passed.\nAnd when I came home, no one was there.\nBut I still kept two pairs of indoor slippers ready.\n***\nHonestly, I failed a few more times.\nQuitting wasn’t easy.\nSometimes, I ended up taking too much without thinking.\nI was too depressed, and I wanted to escape.\nDrugs made me feel better.\nHonestly, shouldn’t I be dead by now?\nI heard this stuff had severe side effects.\nPeople said I had already passed the lethal dose long ago.\nSo why wasn’t I dead?\n\"Is it some kind of system restriction? Am I just not allowed to die from this?\"\nI even started asking myself that.\nThere was no one to answer.\nI had to die in front of Shihu.\nIf I died from an overdose, that wouldn’t work.\nMaybe that’s why I wasn’t dying.\nThis world was full of things that didn’t make sense anyway.\nBesides, it was a world the protagonist had abandoned.\nWhat did it matter what happened to the people left behind?\nAs long as the main story remained coherent, that was enough.\n\"...Ahaha...\"\nLet’s say there was a reader.\nAs long as the world looked fine through their eyes, nothing else mattered.\nAnd this world—\nIt was nothing more than the setting for the villain’s backstory.\nThe background story of the Doctor.\nReaders weren’t supposed to care about it in detail.\nSo did it really matter?\nA world that had been discarded?\nOf course, questions still remained.\nThe Doctor in this world had once been Shihu in another.\nDid that Shihu go through the exact same things?\nI had no way of knowing.\nBut in the main story, the cycle between Shihu and the Doctor was broken.\nSeo Ah had died at the right time.\nHowever, in the world before the main story unfolded, Seo Ah didn’t die.\nSomehow, she survived.\nAnd she kept holding onto Hansihoo, dragging him down.\n\"...Scary.\"\nHow did the Seo Ah of that timeline survive?\nNo matter how much worse off she was, it wouldn’t have been surprising.\nEven if she had been crippled beyond recognition,\nShihu wouldn’t have been able to let her go so easily.\nSo I wished—\nI desperately wished that Shihu would go back in time and save Seo Ah.\nThat he wouldn’t become the Doctor, with his memories and convictions twisted.\n\"I’m scared.\"\nHonestly, being alone was terrifying.\nIf I didn’t speak, this place was drowned in silence.\nWhat did I do to deserve this?\nI don’t know if I was punished for committing a sin,\nbut I do know that in this state, I might as well have sinned.\n\"I don’t want to be alone.\"\nDrugs made being alone bearable.\nBut it was because of drugs that I ended up alone.\nStill, when I took them, I could be alone without a problem.\nBut if I took them, I wouldn’t be able to face Shihu.\nNow that I think about it—\nShihu was the one who gave me the drugs.\nSo the Doctor was first.\nThen where did this cycle begin?\nWhich came first, the chicken or the egg?\nWho was wrong first?\nWas it Seo Ah, who used the drugs Shihu gave her?\nOr was it Shihu, who gave her the drugs because of Seo Ah?\nBut even if it wasn’t Shihu,\nsomeone else could have given me the drugs.\nAnd if it wasn’t for Seo Ah,\nShihu wouldn’t have gone back in time.\nSo maybe—\nMaybe it really was Seo Ah’s fault.\n\"Why did you do it?\"\nI don’t know.\nBut if I don’t know, then who does?\n\"......\"\nI knew that talking to myself like this made me look crazy.\nBut I was aware of it.\nThat meant I wasn’t actually crazy.\nI wasn’t losing my mind.\nI was perfectly normal.\nI think I’ve said this before.\nBut anyway, it’s true.\nI’m normal.\nThis isn’t just because of the drugs.\nI have to be normal.\nOtherwise, Shihu won’t come back.\nIf I had never taken the drugs,\nmy childhood friend wouldn’t have left.\nI replaced him with drugs.\nBoth Shihu and I drowned in them—one way or another.\nAnyway, I’m normal.\nI don’t see hallucinations anymore.\nI barely hear voices now.\nThat means I’m normal, right?\nI dress properly.\nI keep myself well-groomed.\nI take care of my appearance.\nIf Shihu saw me now, he wouldn’t be embarrassed to be around me.\nProbably.\nLet’s think about it.\nIf I were Shihu,\nwould I want to be with the current Seo Ah?\n…Yeah.\nTo some extent.\nBut it still feels like something’s missing.\nMy personality?\nI’m not bright enough.\nI should bring back that sunny smile.\nIf I can’t change what’s inside, I should at least fix what’s outside.\nNo matter how rotten my insides are,\npeople only see what’s on the surface.\nSo I started practicing smiling in front of the mirror every day.\nBack in the past, I didn’t need to do this.\n\"Aha… ha…\"\nThe Seo Ah in the mirror was smiling.\nBut she still looked sad.\n***\nTime kept passing.\nEven in the memories of others, Shihu's presence was gradually fading.\nI could feel it.\nToday, I saw a familiar face on a billboard.\nCheon Yuseong.\nBack at the academy, he was just another competent student.\nBut now, it seemed he had made his way into politics.\nImpressive.\nOriginally, the world was supposed to become a paradise for the Awakened.\nBut thanks to the Doctor’s efforts, the Awakened had gone from the elite to the abnormal.\nMaybe that’s why people like me were given a chance.\nI arrived at the café first.\nIt was six in the morning—still a long way until opening.\nBut I had nothing better to do, so I always came early.\nCleaning and setting things up made the time pass quickly.\nSometimes, I thought I could feel happiness in my daily life.\nOr maybe it was just an illusion.\nMy brain had been so damaged that I couldn’t really experience happiness anymore.\nStill, I forced myself to feel it.\nI didn’t use drugs anymore.\nMaybe the Doctor had been right about some things.\nHe had said I was cured.\nLiving in a world where magic was restricted made quitting easier.\nI really did feel like I was recovering.\nRecovery...\nI had been through too much for my body to be completely fine.\nBut on the outside, there didn’t seem to be any major issues.\nMaybe I was just rusted metal, covered up with a fresh coat of paint.\nThen, the bell jingled.\nSomeone had opened the door.\n\"Welcome...?\"\nIt wasn’t opening time yet.\nShihu walked in.\nWho?\nShihu?\nWhy was Shihu here?\n\"Hey, Seo Ah.\"\nI doubted my eyes.\nThis had to be a hallucination.\nBut my body was already moving toward him.\nOne step at a time.\nWithout looking away.\nI must have been smiling.\nAnd then, I reached out to hug him.\nEven if I ended up hugging nothing but air, it didn’t matter.\nBut strangely, I could feel him.\nThere was warmth.\nEven if my broken mind had just grabbed onto a pillar or a chair in the café—\n\"Yeah. Hey.\"\nAt least in that moment, I didn’t need drugs to be happy.",

This time, I won’t fail.\"\nSave who?\nWho was he talking about?\n***\nThis was the moment when Hansihoo made up his mind to go back.\nOn the swing at the playground.\n[Retry]\nSeo Ah’s hallucination disappeared.\nShe said she would wait at home.\nThe real Seo Ah was at a temporary shelter.\nUsing.\nShe stayed there because she knew if she didn’t, she wouldn’t be able to control herself.\nSo she ran away.\nHansihoo sat on the swing.\nBack then, they used to play here.\nThe playground was falling apart now.\nCompared to before, the only real difference was the slide, rusted and broken beyond repair.\nHansihoo had nothing left.\nHe couldn’t save Seo Ah.\nThe only thing left was to [Start Over].\n\"Get it together.\"\nHe clenched the blade in his hand.\nPain surged through him.\nThe blood was hot.\n\"Focus.\"\nHis vision blurred as the blood dripped down.\nIf he gave up, he would truly be left with nothing.\nHe had to endure.\nHe had to remember the promise he had made to himself.\n\"Focus.\"\nHe couldn’t break.\nThis was a battle of will.\nEven in a place where anyone would want to give up, he had to find hope.\nEven if blood poured from his hands, he had to stand firm.\n\"Stay awake.\"\nHe wanted this desperately.\nBut he didn’t just want to go back.\nThe skill—[Restart].\nIt would grant what he wished for.\nAll of his skills had been shaped by his desires.\nBut [Retrying]—\nTrying to rewrite his life from the beginning—\nThat was cheating.\nEven in the skill description, it was written: The price is to give up everything.\nHansihoo couldn’t go down that path.\nHe wouldn’t run back to the past.\n\"The Doctor.\"\nInstinctively, Hansihoo realized how much the Doctor resembled him.\nNo, he had felt it for a long time.\nHe just hadn’t wanted to admit it.\nThe way he thought.\nHis obsession with saving Awakened.\nThe drugs.\nIt was absurd, but…\nWhat if the Doctor was just himself, from another past?\nIf that was true—\nThen the Doctor had saved no one.\nHe had simply crossed over into another world and played the role of an invader.\n\"...So that’s how it is.\"\nHe wouldn’t take the easy way out.\nWhat he wanted was happiness.\nBut for some reason, happiness always came with a price.\nAnd the price was always steep.\nPeople expected him to become a hero.\nHe would tell them to shove it.\nHe wasn’t a hero.\nBut if this was Seo Ah’s wish—\nIf she believed in him—\nThen he had no choice but to do it.\n[Restart]\n\"I...\"\nThis wasn’t starting over.\nLife wasn’t a game.\n\"I won’t give up.\"\nEven if all of his plans failed, he wouldn’t break.\nEven if the pressure crushed his bones and tore his flesh, he wouldn’t stop.\nEven if his insides melted, he would endure.\nEven if his vision blurred, he would keep his eyes on the road ahead.\nEven if his legs gave out, he would run.\nAnd before he knew it—\nHe would reach his destination.\nAt the very least, he would live a life he wasn’t ashamed of.\nThis wasn’t some comfortable [Restart].\nIf he had already started something, he would see it through to the end.\nAnd if he had to finish it, he would do it perfectly.\nHis sword glowed.\nBlood dripped from his hand.\nHe wondered what had gone wrong.\nHe questioned how things had become so twisted.\n\"...Somehow.\"\nHis head was still spinning.\nThe pain had cleared his thoughts, but only to a limit.\nBut he couldn’t stop here.\nNot just refusing to give up—\nThat wasn’t enough.\nHe needed a way.\nThe overuse of drugs had pushed everyone toward destruction.\nHansihoo could feel himself becoming a monster.\nEven if he kept moving forward, there were no answers like this.\nBut he wouldn’t give up.\nBecause hope—\nHope grew as much as you desired it.\nIf he believed it was possible, then it would become possible.\nIt had to.\n\"Again.\"\nHis determination flared.\nThe answer was simple.\nInstead of pressing [Restart]—\nHe pressed [Continue].\n***\nBecause of that, this time—\nthe Doctor never appeared in the story.\nShihu and Seo Ah, though far from ordinary, spent their days in happiness.\nThe story began at the point where Seo Ah first took the drug.\nThe problem started when the so-called \"Doctor\" arrived, drenched in deception.\nShe had gone to a shelter, thinking she had caught a bad cold.\nBut in this version of the story, the shelter hadn’t been destroyed.\nIt was still operating as usual.\n\"Oh, Seo Ah, it’s you.\"\nA doctor appeared.\nBut this time, he was a real doctor—licensed and legitimate.\nSomeone who had helped Seo Ah and Shihu for a long time.\n\"I came because of a cold,\" Seo Ah said, coughing lightly.\n\"I see, I see.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nShe was given proper cold medicine.\nNot a mind-twisting drug.\nJust a simple pill.\nAnd yet, the difference it made in a life was immeasurable.\n\"Oh? What’s this?\"\nSeo Ah pulled a slip of paper from the medicine bag.\nIt looked like a coupon.\n\"It’s a meal ticket for a pretty decent restaurant. You can go with Shihu.\"\n\"Wow...\"\nShe could have questioned where a shelter got the money to hand out expensive meal tickets,\nbut Seo Ah didn’t think that far.\nThe ticket had a simple message: Stay strong.\nFeeling the warmth of someone’s kindness, Seo Ah ran home, eager to show Shihu the meal ticket.\nIt was a small thing.\nBut even small things could bring happiness.\nYet the person who left that ticket no longer existed in this world.\nHansihoo, having traveled back to the past, finally understood why the Doctor had lost his mind.\nHe had gone too far back.\nHe had abandoned everything to return to the past,\nonly to arrive at a time when the Awakened had just begun to appear.\nA time when the gates had first opened,\nwhen monsters had spilled out and slaughtered people.\nA time when Seo Ah and Shihu, after losing their parents, had barely managed to find each other.\nHansihoo rewrote this cruel world.\nFor six months after his return,\nhe tracked down the source of the drug that had consumed their lives.\nAnd after another six months,\nhe finally secured the cure.\nThere were no obstructions in this timeline.\nNo wars had drained the world of resources yet.\nHe could change things.\nNow, it was time to return.\nIf he had become the Doctor,\nhe would have never made it back.\nBut Hansihoo had promised.\nHe had vowed to return.\nAnd now that he had found the cure—\nIt was time to go back.\nBefore he left,\nhe left something for the younger Seo Ah and Shihu.\nHe left funds for the shelter,\nasking them to ensure that if Seo Ah ever came alone,\nshe would at least have a warm meal waiting for her.\nThat was enough.\nA good meal at a decent restaurant.\nA happy memory.\nThe rest,\nhe would leave to this world’s Shihu and Seo Ah.\nThere would be struggles.\nThere would be hardships.\nThey would be poor and lacking in many things.\nBut it would be enough for happiness.\n\"I came back.\"\nHansihoo returned to his original world.\nUnlike the Doctor, who had abandoned his world,\nHansihoo had come back.\nAnd now—\nIt was time to finish what he had started.\n\"And I came to save you. This time, I won’t fail.\"\nSeo Ah had endured with hope.\nThat fragile thread of belief had ignited the spark of something greater.\nA fireworks display to announce a happy ending.\nThey sat on the bench in silence.\nSeo Ah swung her legs back and forth,\nwaiting for the hallucination to fade.\nThe night air was cold.\nShe shouldn’t have been able to feel warmth.\nAnd yet, she did.\nShihu did not disappear.\nThe stars reflected on the river were beautiful.\nThe sky was clear.",

Euthanasia? Something like that.\"\nI was pretending to live like a normal person.\nBut I was standing on the edge.\nIf Shihu had never come back, I would have used it.\nI told myself I was quitting, but I knew the truth.\nMy body was already ruined.\nSooner or later, I would reach my limit.\nRather than suffer a long, painful death—\nWasn’t it better to just take the easy way out?\n\"Why are you making that face?\"\nI frowned.\n\"I haven’t even used it yet... You know that. I don’t even take that much anymore...\"\nWas he judging me?\nWas he disappointed in me?\nDid he think I was still just a drug addict?\nSoftly, he pulled me into an embrace.\n\"Oahh... H-heh...\"\nA weird sound escaped my mouth.\nI was flustered.\nBut happy.\n\"Everything’s going to be okay.\"\n\"Mm.\"\nI didn’t believe him.\nNot at all.\nI wasn’t even sure this was real.\nThere was always the chance that all of this—\nWas just another hallucination.\nIf you climbed too high,\nif you rode hope too far up—\nIt would hurt more when you fell.\n\"Shihu?\"\n\"Yeah?\"\nHow could he prove it?\nThat he was real?\nThat he existed?\n\"...You’re really Shihu, right?\"\n\"I am.\"\nBut I still doubted him.\nShihu understood.\nIt made sense.\nIt was natural for me to distrust everything.\nToo many terrible things had happened.\nIt was a miracle I was even pretending to be sane.\n\"If you’re not real, just tell me... If you’re messing with me, just say so... Stop pretending to be Shihu...\"\nThere was no way something this good could be real.\nThere was no way something I had dreamed of for so long had actually happened.\nI refused to believe it.\n\"I’m sorry. But I’m real.\"\nThere was nothing else he could say.\nThe only way to prove it—\nWas through actions.\nHe would have to stay.\nNot disappear.\nBe by my side.\n\"You’re kind, Shihu.\"\nI reached up and patted his head.\nI must have looked unstable—\nsmiling, then looking like I was about to cry.\n\"I think… I can be happy again.\"\nShihu said it like it was an undeniable fact.\nI smiled.\n\"Yeah.\"\nI closed my eyes.\nAnd soon, I drifted into sleep.\nIt had been a long day.\nI could almost hear the doctor’s voice in my head.\n\"She won’t live long anyway.\"\n\"At least let her feel happiness before she goes.\"\nMaybe—\nMaybe I had already taken the drugs.\nIf this was euthanasia—\nthis moment was the perfect time.\nI had felt warmth.\nAnd then, peace.\nThe bottle on the desk—\nHadn’t it been empty?\nMaybe I had taken them all.\nMaybe I was just drifting away,\nsinking into death,\none last moment of happiness before it all ended.\nThat made more sense, didn’t it?\nThe truth was—\nI was alone.\nThe desperation for someone, anyone,\nhad just forced my mind to create an illusion.\nCould I trust my brain?\nThe same brain that made up convenient explanations for everything I saw?\nNo.\nI didn’t believe it.\nMaybe, deep down, I knew—\nI was taking my last breath.\nThere was no one else in the house.\nAnd soon, there wouldn’t even be me.\nWhen you think about the end,\nit always feels lonely.\nAt the very least,\nI wanted to do something meaningful before I left.\n\"Did I live a meaningful life?\"\nI asked myself.\nHad I lived a life worth remembering?\nProbably not.\nThis was the ending I deserved.\nAll the others from the slums had died long ago.\nI had held on longer than most.\nIt was funny.\nIt was stupid to even doubt.\nI already knew the truth.\nI already knew this was fake.\nI had seen enough hallucinations to know.\nAnd yet, I still questioned it.\nI still asked myself,\n\"Is this real?\"\nNo.\nI made my decision.\nI chose to believe it was fake.\nBecause at least in death,\nI could be honest with myself.\nThere was no such thing as a happy ending.\nAll my choices,\nall my past actions,\nhad only ever led to bad endings.\nThat was the truth.\nMaybe—\nMaybe this was peace.\nMaybe dying—\nwas the only real way to rest.\n***\nI should have died.\nI wiped away the dried tears and sat up.\nCrumpled blankets.\nShihu wasn’t there.\nHad I finally woken up from the hallucination?\nI grabbed the glass of water beside me and drank.\nWarm water ran down my throat.\n…Warm?\nThat wasn’t right.\nThere shouldn’t have been warm water here.\nI looked up.\nShihu was in the living room.\n\"...Is this heaven?\"\nHad I died and gone to heaven?\nDid I even deserve to be here?\nThen again, my life had already felt like hell, so maybe I could be happy after death.\n\"Uweh.\"\nFor some reason, there was a warm meal set out on the table.\nWhy?\n\"Aah, you’re up?\"\nI didn’t know why,\nbut I sat at the table, ate with Shihu, and had a conversation—\nAs if life had returned to normal.\nWhy?\nHad I already taken the drugs today?\nDid I wake up in the middle of the night and use them again?\nThere had been withdrawal symptoms.\nBut...\nWhat was happening?\nStrangely enough, I didn’t feel like taking anything today.\n\"...What is this?\"\nCould I really just… spend time with him?\nWith Shihu?\nCould we really go to the playground together?\nCould I sit and listen to him explain what had happened?\nWhat was this?\n\"Is this real?\"\nI was more used to Shihu not existing than to him being here.\nHaving no one beside me was more familiar than having someone.\nShihu looked troubled.\nWe could be together.\nHe could do anything.\nBut I didn’t believe him.\nHe seemed oddly cautious.\nWe went to the playground, but he didn’t play properly.\nHe was worried—worried that I might get hurt.\nWas this really Shihu?\n\"...Weird.\"\nThat was my impression.\nI still couldn’t believe it.\nIf a hallucination lasted this long,\nwhat was even the difference between it and reality?\nBut...\nIf I was happy,\ndid it really matter?\nShihu looked at me like he was thinking about what to say.\nLike he was handling glass,\nterrified that the wrong word might make me shatter.\nBut that wasn’t right.\nIf we kept acting like this,\nthings would never go back to the way they were.\nSeo Ah hadn’t been so fragile before.\nAnd Shihu,\nyou never treated me like I was fragile.\n\"Shihu?\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"It’s okay. You don’t have to be so careful with me.\"\nI would believe that Shihu was really here.\nWhat was the point of assuming this world was fake?\nThat would only make me anxious.\n\"I’m trying, you know.

Can you protect me? Can you care about me? Can you think about me? Can you stay by my side without hating me?\"\nI asked.\nWas it too selfish of a request?\n\"I—\"\nWhat if he asked, Why should I?\n\"Because I’ll protect you, too. Because I like you. Because I think about you. Because I never planned on leaving you. Because I never once hated you.\"\n\"I’ll do whatever I can.\"\nMaybe—\nMaybe a happy ending was possible.\nOr maybe—\nThis wasn’t an ending at all.\nMaybe this was a prologue.\nShihu smiled.\nThinking about it—\nWasn’t that more important?\nThat he smiled?\nMore than me forcing myself to smile awkwardly.\n\"I never wanted to go back to the past. If I did, I wouldn’t have come back.\"\n\"You like the me that’s here now?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nIt was embarrassingly cheesy.\nHappiness was unfamiliar.\nMaybe, at any moment, I would come crashing down again.\nBut for now, this was enough.\nEven if everything after this was a tragedy—\nFor me, this was a happy ending.\nSo, everyone lived happily ever after.\nThe world was still a mess.\nBut who cared?\nNot everyone was happy.\nBut so what?\nThat’s how the world was.\nActually, this wasn’t a happy ending.\nI wouldn’t be happy all the time.\nIf I used drugs, I would be happy—\nfor a moment.\nI would ride a high,\nreach an extreme,\nthen drop dead at the peak.\nWould that be the real happy ending?\nNo.\nA happy ending felt too grand.\nA normal ending would be enough.\nHow did I feel when I finished reading a book?\nThat was supposed to be a happy ending,\nbut why did it always feel so... unsettling?\nAh.\nThat’s right.\n\"The childhood friend was kind of pitiful.\"\nThat was what I had thought.\nAt the beginning of the story, she had mattered.\nBut at some point, she had been completely forgotten.\nThat was how things were meant to be.\nBut now—\nSeo Ah existed.\nThat alone meant I had succeeded.\nIt wasn’t strange that I had never done anything significant.\nI had tried.\nI had failed.\nBut that wasn’t weird.\nThat was how things were meant to be.\nBut this time,\nI had gone against fate.\nA simple wish—\n\"I want to stay with you.\"\nThat was all it took.\nSo I held onto Shihu’s hand.\nI wasn’t here to kill the Doctor.\nI wasn’t here to save the world.\nThat wasn’t my goal.\nAll I had to do was stay here.\nAnd that was enough.\nI had won.\nThere were times when I questioned whether I should even be alive.\nBut in the end—\nI lived.\n\"Ahat.\"\nThen—\n\"Huha-hat.\"\nI laughed.\nFor the first time in a long time—\nI felt good without taking anything.\nMaybe—\nMaybe this was a happy ending.",
